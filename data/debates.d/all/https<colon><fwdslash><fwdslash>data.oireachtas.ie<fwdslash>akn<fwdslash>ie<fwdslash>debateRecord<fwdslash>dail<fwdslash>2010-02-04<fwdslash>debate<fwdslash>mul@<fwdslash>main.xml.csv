Two projects that have been affected are Sphere 17, which supports young people and helps them develop, and the RASP Project based in Dublin 17, which helps people coming from a drug misuse background.  They have suffered cruelly under these major cuts.  I ask the Government to reverse these cruel cutbacks, in light of the negative effect that the they will have on the individuals, the families and the communities concerned.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It is proposed to take No. 18, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2010, which is back from committee;  No. 4, Employment Agency Regulation Bill 2009 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to adjourn at 1.30 p.m. today, if not previously concluded;  No. 29 — statements on the special report by the Ombudsman on the lost at sea scheme.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 18 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on No. 29 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, the statements of each other member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, Members may share time and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It is not agreed.  It was agreed at the committee during the week that we would fund the horse and greyhound fund for the coming year.  However, the intention of the legislation was that the funding would come from the tax on gambling.  In 2002, after changing the legislation, Exchequer funding was provided linked to the consumer price index to top up that fund.  To continue to do this is unsustainable.  There are options in respect of taxation of on-line gambling and this must be put in place to sustain this fund.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I appreciate what the Deputy has said and it has been raised on a number of occasions when the issue of funding horses and greyhounds has been discussed.  I am not in a position to say right now what proposals, if any, the Minister for Finance will consider to deal with the tax loss arising from on-line gambling.  I am sure the secretary of the committee may be in a position to advise the Minister of the Deputy's concerns.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	9	This is a proposal for dealing with the report from the Ombudsman regarding the complaint he received on the lost at sea scheme.  The arrangements proposed by the Government on this issue are for statements to be made in the House today.  That is fine as far as it goes, and I am glad the issue is to be discussed in the House.  However, we have to decide how we will deal with this report.  The core issue is ensuring that the independence of the Office of the Ombudsman is fully respected.  This is the second time in the history of the office that a recommendation from the Ombudsman was rejected by a Department.  On the previous occasion — a recommendation in 2002 concerning the Revenue Commissioners — it was referred to an Oireachtas committee and was eventually resolved.  The arrangement proposed for today is that the House will have statements on the issue.When the Ombudsman carries out an investigation and issues a report that is rejected by a Department, the recourse the Ombudsman has is to make a report on that to the Oireachtas, and it is then a matter for the Oireachtas to deal with it.  Will the Government agree to have this matter considered by an Oireachtas committee, as was the case in 2002?  I would like to hear the Tánaiste's opinion on it now, but I would also like to hear it during the statements today.  It is not appropriate that this is dealt with by statements after which the House moves on.  The House must make a decision.  In cases where a recommendation is rejected, the Ombudsman states:My only option when this arises is to seek the intervention of the Oireachtas.  It now has the task of deciding who is right and who is wrong in the context of good administration and fairness to the complainant.The Oireachtas must exercise its function in that regard.  That should be done in a non-partisan way, which is why I suggest the best way of dealing with this is to refer it to an Oireachtas committee, as was done before.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	On the previous occasion when the Ombudsman laid a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service considered it.  The precedent is that the report goes to the committee.  I welcome the fact there will be statements but that does not constitute consideration of the report as requested by the Ombudsman.  The conclusions of the previous investigation were that the recommendations in respect of the Revenue Commissioners' case should be implemented.  The committee that considered it recommended all future recommendations of the Ombudsman's office should be automatically accepted.  There is precedent in the manner in which these issues have been dealt with by the House and this should inform how we deal with the matter today.  A sterile debate, as proposed by the Government, where there are statements but no detailed forensic examination of the Ombudsman's report is a slight on the Ombudsman's office and undermines public confidence.  The fat cats of society can go in the front gate of Government Buildings but the ordinary citizen who has a complaint against the State only has access to the Ombudsman's office to deliver justice.  That is what is at stake.

She definitely expected we would collectively consider her report.  That is the critical difference.  What is provided for in the Order of Business is comment and statements.  It never results in specific action or inter-exchange.  It is critically important we provide a mechanism to allow for collective consideration of the detail of the Ombudsman's report.  Accordingly, I support the other Opposition voices and urge all-party agreement that the Ombudsman's report on the lost at sea scheme be addressed in full session by the relevant committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the appropriate place to which it should be sent.  We should reserve the opportunity to address the deliberations of the committee in the Chamber when it reports back.  I hope we have agreement and that the Tánaiste will signal an acceptance of that proposition on behalf of the Government.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	We have consistently raised this matter on this side of the House in the context that it should be debated initially as requested by the Ombudsman's office in both Houses of the Oireachtas and subsequently referred to committee for a forensically detailed examination.  This is where it should rightfully be carried on.  The Government is attempting to have a meaningless, sterile format, statements where there is no analysis.  The Government is circling the wagons to protect one of its own.  That is what is at stake.  Deputy Fahey would welcome the opportunity to defend himself.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20780	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I wish to raise several issues on the Order of Business.  The United States company, Kraft Foods, recently indicated its intention to take over Cadbury, which will have a significant impact on employment throughout the Cadbury group.  Some 1,200 are employed by the company in this State between Coolock and Kerry.  The British Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Lord Mandelson, has met with the chief executive officer of Cadbury to seek to protect jobs in that jurisdiction, but the Tánaiste seems to be of the view that it would be inappropriate to intervene in this way.  Will she reconsider this short-sighted position?  There are extraordinary exposures for this company which has been a significant employer for a long time.An issue that has come to public attention following the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is the situation where 4,000 trips were taken by persons, predominantly spouses, who were not staff members of the relevant agencies.  Where is the compass of propriety in respect of the spending of public money when it is seen fit for so many employees to have their spouses' travel expenses paid for by the taxpayer under the pretence of exceptional circumstances?  We must have reassurance from the Government that these practices will be stopped immediately.  They are unacceptable to taxpayers who will today see a finance Bill which seeks to scrape money——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20780	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	43	In respect of promised legislation on banking, reports today indicate that the write-downs by the National Asset Management Agency will be much greater than was anticipated.  It is now clear that the business plan presented by NAMA to the Oireachtas is a work of fiction, as many on this side of the House said at the time.  It is incumbent on the Government to produce legislation that will provide for a bank resolution regime of the type that has been available in the United Kingdom and the United States for a considerable period, in order to deal with banks that get into difficulties.  The Minister for Finance indicated that such a proposal was in preparation, but it has not figured in the list of legislation that has been presented thus far.  What is the status of that legislation and when will it come before the House?  When will we see the order transferring specific duties in respect of banking policy to the National Treasury Management Agency that were heretofore exercised by the Department of Finance?  These decisions are of enormous importance.  Any relevant order must be laid before the House and properly debated, and proper accountability must be written into the terms of that order.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	44	On the same issue, I have a query in regard to the proposal by the Minister for Finance to bring an order before the House regarding the transfer of powers to the NTMA.  The legal advice available to the Labour Party indicates there is no power on the part of the Minister to delegate to the NTMA.  The latter is effectively a secret organisation that is not open to any public scrutiny and is exempt from freedom of information legislation in the same way that the Central Bank staff who provided their spouses with hundreds of trips abroad are exempt from those provisions.  What is the position regarding this extraordinary delegation of functions in respect of banking policy and a substantial area of economic policy via an order to the NTMA?

When will this order come before the House and what is the position in regard to the Attorney General's advice?  Our legal advice indicates it is not possible for the Minister for Finance to delegate advisory functions to the NTMA under the relevant legislation.  In regard to NAMA, the NTMA has very limited functions and I do not see how it can be done under NAMA legislation either.

Under Standing Order 26, the following can be raised: business on the Order Paper; the taking of business that has been promised — which is what was just raised by my colleague — including legislation promised either within or outside the Dáil; the making of secondary legislation; arrangements for sittings; and when Bills and other documents on the Order Paper will be circulated.  However, the Ceann Comhairle seems to be restricting it to promised legislation, which he has no power to do.

When will the Government afford us the opportunity to address the disastrous failures of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator?  We have a situation where the Comptroller and Auditor General's report clearly indicates the serious inappropriate conduct and failure to regulate within those entities.  The Bills I refer to are the Central Bank (consolidation) Bill and the Central Bank (No. 2) Bill, the latter of which is intended to address the question of necessary changes and enhancements to the regulatory functions of the bank.Does the Tánaiste accept that for most Members and for the public it is difficult to accept that the Central Bank should have a regulatory role in view of the exposure of the fact that it cannot even regulate its own business but instead accommodated excessive overseas travel by executives and their spouses?  There are serious matters to address and that should be done on the floor of this House.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I will begin with Deputy Bruton's question regarding Kraft Food's takeover of Cadbury, an issue that has been raised by several Deputies in the House.  Last night I met the chief executive officer of Enterprise Ireland and we agreed to provide every support possible to Cadbury, which is based in Ireland, in the context of the business plan it must put forward as part of the restructuring announced by the chief executive officer of Kraft Foods.  I am aware that Lord Mandelson has already met the latter and I too have requested a meeting with her.  It will be more useful for that meeting to take place when we have a proposed business plan for the sustainability of Cadbury's presence in the State.  It is on that basis that I did not ask to meet the chief executive officer until such time as the takeover is finalised and we are given an outline of the timeframe in which Kraft Foods is moving ahead with its new management.  However, I have been advised that it will be a difficult task to make the case for Cadbury's sustainability in Ireland in the context of the overproduction and oversupply that will arise from the takeover.  Having said that, we will put our best foot forward and will give all necessary support to the workers and the company.  I will keep Members who represent the workers in Dublin and Kerry apprised of developments.The Minister proposes to introduce two Bills relating to the Central Bank, and we anticipate the first will come before the House by Easter.  It will be a relatively short Bill that will concentrate on reforming the regulatory structures of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  This relatively short Bill will concentrate on reforming the regulatory structures in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  Corporate governance will be very much to the fore in that context.  The management will respond to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The legislation to be enacted this year will set out a new statutory basis for the senior management structure.  Corporate governance issues will also be addressed, as I have indicated.  As the Central Bank is an independent institution, it is not subject to the direction of the Minister for Finance or the Government in the discharge of its functions.I understand that the Minister for Finance outlined his proposals on the other issue to the House last night or the night before.  It is important to emphasise that the delegation of functions will not dilute the responsibility of the Minister for Finance in any way.  He will continue to be fully responsible and accountable to this House.  The arrangements he is proposing——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20780	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Tánaiste has been in government for so long that she has forgotten the replies given to Opposition spokespersons when we ask questions about agencies.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20780	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	85	We are told that the Minister is not responsible for day-to-day activities.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I reiterate that the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to the Oireachtas will stand firm.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Let us be honest — this is about the nationalisation of the banks.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	88	That is what the Deputy wants.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	89	It is nationalisation for slow learners.  It will lead to the total destruction of our economy.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	91	That is what the Minister and his colleagues are doing.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The Deputy is going back to her roots.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I ask the Tánaiste to convey my thanks to the Taoiseach for writing to me today in response to the questions I asked him yesterday and the day before about the cost of the deal that was done with senior public servants to exempt them from the full effect of the pay cuts.  In the letter, which was hand-delivered to me this morning, the Taoiseach informed me that approximately 655 public servants, including 157 assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries in the Civil Service, are encompassed in the pay adjustment.  The Taoiseach's response also stated that the cost of this adjustment is less than €5 million.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will give me the exact figure at a reasonably early stage, when it is available to him.  I would be surprised if the use of the phrase "less than €5 million" was somehow intended to convey the idea that it is not a huge amount, as it is clear that the Government is looking for savings of that nature.  I remind the House that the Minister for Education and Science intends to abolish the NUI and estimates that €1 million will be saved as a result.  I doubt if that will be the case, given the cost of rebranding NUI Maynooth and NUI Galway.  At a time when the Government is looking for savings of that order, this €5 million adjustment is not that insignificant.  Perhaps I will be given the full figure.Second, I note on the Government's list of legislation that it intends to publish another social welfare Bill this year.  The Government rushed the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2009 through the Dáil just before Christmas by guillotining it.  That Bill gave effect to the social welfare cuts that were announced on budget day.  Do I take it from the promise to introduce a further social welfare Bill that the Government is planning a second round of social welfare cuts later this year?Third, the Tánaiste will have noticed in the last day or two the announcement that Carluccio's restaurant on Dawson Street, which is quite close to Leinster House, is to close with a loss of 60 jobs.  This successful business is closing because it cannot secure a downward revision of the rent arrangement into which it entered during the boom times.  A Private Members' Bill produced by Deputy Ciarán Lynch, which is on the Order Paper, is designed to allow for downward reductions of commercial rents.  Will the Government accept that Bill?  It is scandalous that 60 jobs will have to be lost from an entirely successful business in the middle of the city.  I accept that other businesses are in the same position.  Although the restaurant is full every time I go there, it is closing because it cannot get a downward rent review.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I cannot allow a detailed contribution on this matter.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The Labour Party identified this problem some time ago.  Deputy Ciarán Lynch prepared a Private Members' Bill and published it last June.  This matter needs to be dealt with.  Businesses are closing down because they are being screwed for high rents that might have had some degree of appropriateness in the good times, but are completely out of kilter in these times.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The social welfare Bill mentioned by the Deputy will be introduced in this session.  Although we would all like rents to be reduced, we cannot legislate to change contracts that have been legally entered into.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Of course we can.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Yes we can.  Has the Tánaiste ever heard that expression?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	99	If the Deputies do not want to hear the answer, that is fine.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	100	They might be able to do it in Moscow.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced legislation at the beginning of December to deal with the issue of upward-only rent reviews, which had been raised by retailers.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	That legislation relates to new leases and not to existing businesses.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Fianna Fáil is protecting its own people.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I would like to ask about the wildlife (amendment) Bill, which is due to be published in this session.  It will deal with matters relating to stag hounds and provide for regulations to address invasive species.  I suggest that the Government should introduce that legislation quite quickly.  Has the Bill been considered by the Government?  Has it been approved for publication?  Will it be published shortly?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	111	The only endangered species around here is Deputy Gogarty.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Deputy Hogan was talking about invasive species, rather than endangered species.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	113	Deputy Gogarty is on Facebook.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for confirming that a question about a statutory instrument, which I asked in this House last week or the week before, was in order.  It has since been answered.  I would like to ask the Tánaiste about a Fingal County Council regulation, limiting the rate on valuation, which has been passed by means of statutory instrument.  Under the relevant Act, which dates from 2005 or 2006, statutory instruments have been introduced in respect of the rates on valuation of two local authorities.  I am sure the Tánaiste understands the importance of this matter for businesses and rate payers.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	120	Are we talking about promised business?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	121	No, we are talking about a statutory instrument that is before the House and which we have 21 days to challenge.  It is absurd that at the current rate, it will take the Valuation Office at least 37 years to complete the revaluation of rates in Ireland.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	122	It is like the primary care strategy.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I would like to hear Tánaiste's response on what the Government intends to do about the statutory instrument.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	124	The implementation of the Valuation Act involves the revaluation of rents.  The Deputy is probably aware that not everybody was enamoured with the revaluation that took place in his constituency.  People saw a huge increase in their rates as a consequence.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	125	That is because it was based on 2005.  The valuations in 2038 will also be based on 2005.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Deputy Varadkar, please.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I am sure the Deputy's constituents briefed him on this issue.  That said, a roll-out of valuations is taking place.  It takes a considerable amount of time——
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Thirty years.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	129	——because people have the opportunity to accept or reject them.  In respect of the statutory instruments that have been laid before the House, I must revert to the Deputy as it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I tried to raise this issue on the Adjournment during the week but a three-month delay in payments is required.  I refer to the issue of REPS 4 payments in County Kerry.  The agricultural offices in Tralee and Killarney are without district superintendents.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	131	This constitutes detail that is relevant to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

However, I tried to raise this matter but could not.  The position is that the agricultural offices in County Kerry are dependent on outside superintendents coming in to sign off on files for payments.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	133	We really cannot have this sort of detail on the Order of Business.

When will such legislation come before the House and when will it take effect?  This is a major problem.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Deputy Naughten, on the same issue.

Last night, the Minister for Health and Children disclosed in the Seanad that the problem does not pertain to the drafting of the legislation but that it has not been communicated to Brussels.  Last night in the Seanad, the Minister for Health and Children made the point that——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Deputy Naughten, we cannot have this sort of detail on the Order of Business.

The point was that were this statutory instrument to be put in place within the next four weeks, we would be obliged to wait for three months for it to be approved by Brussels.  Given that the NAMA legislation could go through the Oireachtas in a couple of weeks and receive approval from Brussels and given that head shops are advertising on the basis that such chemicals are already legal, signing the ministerial order in advance of getting approval from Brussels would ensure that such products could no longer be advertised as being legal in this State.

I support the point just made by Deputy Naughten regarding the statutory instrument and dealing with this matter expeditiously.  Part of the problem is that new products will be introduced by the manufacturers which are not encompassed by the statutory instrument.  Consequently, a broader response also is required and the Tánaiste should indicate whether further legislation will be introduced in addition to the secondary legislation.  This could be done under the planning laws or perhaps by ensuring that such head shops must be licensed.  A broader and more comprehensive measure is required to ensure they will not simply get around the statutory instrument and produce something else.

This is a major issue and I note reports in today's newspaper editions that a judge found himself to be the landlord of a head shop.  He found himself in this position simply because——

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	183	This matter is related to legislation that has been promised in this House.  Two years ago, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government promised to set up a group, which presumably is beavering away at present, to examine the question of retail legislation in order that all operations of this nature, including adult shops as well as head shops——-
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Have we promised business in this area?

Second, with regard to mislabelling on the part of head shops, what about consumer enforcement and secondary legislation in that respect?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	186	On the same subject, I agree with all the points that have been made.  Members have asked a number of times that legislation on this issue should include a quarantining of analogues of any substances that have been banned and that planning laws should be put in place to make it more difficult for people to set up such shops beside schools or outside nightclubs.  In addition, Members have sought product liability insurance and that any substances being sold for human consumption must be passed by the Irish Medicines Board and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  I agree absolutely with the point made by Deputy Naughten as there is no need to wait for Europe in this regard.

Fifty years ago, a temporary building was put in place in St. Ita's in north Dublin to house people who needed to be admitted with acute psychiatric illnesses and they still are there today.  There are 23 people to a single room with 2 ft. between the beds, one shower and a bank of three toilets.

Why has the Minister not made available funds to apply for planning permission?  The money is available to build a unit in Beaumont.  It was obliged to move because of the private co-located hospital.  While another site is available, planning permission has not been applied for.  Although this is the second decade of the third millennium, people are living in Dickensian conditions.  It is the greatest insult to people with mental illness in Ireland and it must be addressed.

As for the role of a number of other Departments, the Government is working on co-ordinating how this matter can be dealt with.  The Government takes this issue very seriously and I believe the Upper House had a discussion on an all-party motion on the subject yesterday.  The Government is working to ensure that these regulations are prepared as a matter of urgency.  I wish Deputy Naughten well at his public meeting in Roscommon tonight.

Have the heads of the Bill been discussed?  What degree of agreement has been reached on the heads of the Bill?  When will it be brought before the House?The Ceann Comhairle will agree that another very serious issue is the bail (amendment) Bill, which is also promised.  On this, the Government states that it is not possible to indicate at this stage when it will be introduced.  In view of the serious, and correct, emphasis on crime in the House at present, what attempts are being made to bring the Bill before the House as a matter of urgency?Here is another matter that the Ceann Comhairle will love, on which we have huffed and puffed, brought the legislation before the House and passed, but still have not implemented.  This is the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 which was passed on 23 July 2009.  The Minister must introduce a draft of restrictions in respect of the Bill, which are to be placed before the House and adopted prior to the legislation being legally active.  When is this likely to happen?  It is promised.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	215	The heads of the national vetting bureau Bill are being prepared by the Minister of State with a view to having it with us fairly quickly.  There is no date for the bail (amendment) Bill.  With regard to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill, I know the Deputy had a response to his parliamentary question and a further response regarding the enactment of the new provision 26A.  A draft was laid before the House on 19 January 2010 and a resolution will be put to the House in due course.

We need to ensure there is no repeat of the banking fiascoes in the future.  Can the Bill be referred to the Committee on Finance and the Public Service so that it can take presentations from the various stakeholders concerned?

Prior to Christmas I asked the Taoiseach about it and he agreed with many of the points I made but he did not clarify precisely what the scope of the legislation will be.  When does the Tánaiste expect the Bill to be published?  Is it envisaged that the Bill will include badly needed statutory guidelines on eligibility for legal aid?  Will there be a limit on the number of times that any individual would be entitled to legal aid?  I believe eligibility requirements should be predicated on income and assets declared to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is quite well documented that very high profile members of criminal gangs, which we debated during Private Members' time yesterday and the day before, avail of legal aid when it is quite clear that they ought not to be in a position to do so.  It is imperative that this new legislation, for which we have been waiting since 1962, will cover these major loopholes and discrepancies in the system.  Is it envisaged that the fees paid under the current criminal legal aid scheme will be reviewed in the context of the current economic situation?

I am sure the Minister would take on board a number of the issues raised by Deputy Creighton and perhaps it would be appropriate for her to forward her views to him for consideration prior to the publication of the legislation.

I know the Tánaiste has an interest in the area so she knows it is simply a matter of extending standards to institutions that care for people with an intellectual or physical disability.  As we have discussed here on many occasions, some of the standards are on very simple matters such as respect, choice of food, heating, visiting and being able to move freely.  Inspection is important and the inspectorate is the area which will cost money.  The legislation exists and it is a matter of extending it.  In view of what we read in recent days, I am sure the Tánaiste would be in favour of moving it along as speedily as possible.

They are being considered and HIQA is working with the HSE on rolling out those standards.  The Deputy is correct that there will be financial implications.  That being said, the Government is also considering, following on from the Ryan report, the inclusion of further proposals on the protection of vulnerable adults with disability who are in institutional care.  We are all anxious that the standards set by HIQA for all aspects of care and attention should be across the board for everyone regardless of whether they have a disability.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to bring the Employment Agency Regulation Bill 2009 before this House for debate.  I propose to make some general observations on the rationale and principles informing the content of the Bill because I appreciate that Members will have a fuller opportunity to explore the provisions in more detail on Committee Stage.The current licensing system governing the operation of the employment agency sector in Ireland is underpinned by the Employment Agency Act 1971, which has been in place for more than 35 years.  The 1971 legislation was enacted at a time when the intention was to protect vulnerable Irish emigrants from exploitation by employment agencies abroad.  The employment market in Ireland has been transformed in the intervening period and employment agencies have responded by developing their services to meet the needs of potential end user enterprises and agency workers.In addition, the accession of new central and eastern European states in May 2004 has resulted in free movement of persons between these countries and Ireland and the deployment of temporary workers from employment agencies in EEA states in end user undertakings in Ireland.  Key concerns in the review and partnership discussions pertained to the potential for exploitation of vulnerable agency workers from overseas and non-compliance with Irish employment rights legislation by employment agencies as employers, particularly in respect of personnel assigned as agency workers across national boundaries to end user undertakings in one state where the formal employer is based in another state.The Bill before the House responds to commitments agreed under the social partnership agreements in Towards 2016 and the review and transition agreement 2008-09.  At the core of the agreement by the social partners is a commitment to reinforce the existing system of regulation by requiring all employment agencies established or operating in Ireland to hold a licence.  The focus of the Bill is, therefore, on the licensing and regulation of employment agencies which supply agency workers to an end user, or hirer, undertaking in Ireland.  It provides for a mandatory licensing framework which will also embrace employment agencies delivering a service from outside the State even where they do not have a physical presence here.  As such, the Bill is aimed at updating and strengthening the current licensing system.  The provisions in the Bill are focused on ensuring that potential vulnerable agency workers posted temporarily from such agencies are protected against abuse and exploitation.The Bill provides that employment agencies established in the State may operate only under a licence granted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It also provides that employment agencies established in another EEA state must apply for an employment agency licence unless the Minister is satisfied that agencies in that state are permitted to operate in accordance with a licence or are otherwise appropriately regulated, authorised or supervised in that state.  Such agencies will be recognised agencies within the terms of the Bill.  Employment agencies from outside the EEA seeking to supply agency workers to Ireland will be subject to the State's employment permit system.Deputies will appreciate that it has not proved possible to adopt a one size fits all approach to licensing employment agencies operating in Ireland.  We are constrained in our approach by concerns about the legality of licensing agencies in other EU member states in which employment agencies are already subject to regulation and control because we could be deemed to be infringing EU treaty provisions as interpreted by European Court of Justice rulings.  Licensing could be construed, for example, as a non-tariff barrier to provision of cross-border services.The Bill provides that it will be an offence for an employment agency to carry on its business in the State if it is not licensed or a recognised employment agency.  To further underpin the regulatory framework, an end user undertaking in Ireland is prohibited from recruiting an agency worker to work in the State from an employment agency which is required to be licensed but does not hold a licence.  An end user undertaking which fails to comply with this provision will be guilty of an offence.The Bill clearly embraces employment agencies which provide placement and worker hire services.  The latter agencies are often referred to as a temporary employment agencies in respect of which a triangular relationship is established between the agency, as employer, the agency worker and an end user undertaking to which the agency worker is assigned and under the direction and control of which he or she works.  The Bill does not, nor is it intended to, interfere with the fundamental characteristics of this established triangular relationship.The Bill provides for the designation by the Minister, after consultation with an advisory committee, of a code of practice.  The code will set out the practices and standards of behaviour including practical guidance to employment agencies for the purposes of complying with the provisions of the Act and any regulations made under it.  The code will be an instrument to guide best practice in the employment agency sector.  A code of practice by its very nature is meant to provide guidance on compliance and as such will not be a statutory obligation.  Clearly, however, employment agencies which fully embrace the terms of the code of practice could use it as an important marketing tool in terms of the quality of services they offer.Apart from submitting the code of practice for the sector for the approval of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the proposed advisory committee will also advise on the ongoing operation of the new legislation and the employment agency sector generally.  The advisory committee will include representatives of the social partners and other interested parties, including the agency sector, departmental nominees and ministerial appointments.  The committee will comprise no more than ten persons with a chairperson.  A core element of its work, immediately after the enactment of the legislation and following the issue of a commencement order, will be to draw up a proposed code of practice.In addition to being given the capacity to revoke a licence, the Minister is also being provided with powers to prohibit recognised employment agencies from operating in Ireland where an agency has contravened the provisions of the Bill.  The capacity to suspend for stated reasons employment agencies from another EEA state for a period of three years is a potent measure to help secure compliance with the core objectives and intent of the Bill.We have also been considering ways in which a provision might be included in the current Bill to further strengthen the enforcement of employment law in respect of agencies established outside the jurisdiction.  Given that it is regarded as contrary to EU law to require an agency to appoint a specified representative in the State for the purpose of ensuring compliance with employment legislation, we have considered whether an agency might be prosecuted for an alleged criminal breach of the law even where the defendant fails to appear for the trial.  The advantage of such an approach is that a prosecutor could realistically proceed against employment agencies which offend against employment law and ultimately prevent them from operating in the State on foot of a conviction.  This could prove to be a valuable tool in enforcing employment rights compliance.  A provision for prosecution in absentia for offences under employment rights legislation has been included in the Bill.As regards the enforcement of decisions of Irish courts and tribunals, including rights commissioners, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, in EEA states, it will be possible to enforce Irish judgments under Brussels I regulations on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  These regulations will enable persons who are employed by an employment agency established in another EEA state and who perform services in the State on behalf of a hirer undertaking to obtain remedies against the agency concerned in respect of breaches by it of Irish employment legislation.  It will also enable them to enforce a judgment or decision of an Irish court or tribunal in any member state other than Denmark.  Under the terms of regulation 44/2001, a judgment of a court or tribunal in Ireland is recognisable and enforceable in any other member state to which the regulation applies.  The Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act 1998 will apply in respect of Denmark and other EEA states.The Bill also includes measures to counter penalisation of agency workers and to protect such workers in the context of disclosure.  Agency workers are thus being provided with standard whistle blower protections.The Bill, which provides an enhanced and strengthened regulatory framework for employment agencies established and operating in the State, means that core commitments in the social partnership agreements are being met to the maximum extent consistent with our treaty obligations.  The framework allows for a balanced approach which provides for the protection of potentially vulnerable agency workers while at the same time allowing employers flexibility to fill job vacancies.The Government also intends to hold open the possibility of introducing an appropriate mechanism to prohibit, save in relation to essential services, the use of agency workers supplied by an end user undertaking for the direct replacement of employees in cases of an official strike or lock out.  The prospect of such a provision is based on the assumption that sufficient progress can be made by employers' representatives and trade unions in concluding a framework agreement under Article 5.4 of the EU directive on temporary agency work.  That directive provides for equal treatment of temporary agency workers and workers directly recruited by an end user undertaking to the same job.  The directive provides for equal treatment from the first day of employment for agency workers and a derogation by agreement between the national social partners on an agreed time limit or qualifying period before which the agency worker would qualify for equal treatment.  My Department is facilitating meetings between the social partners to help them develop a framework agreement within the parameters of the EU directive.  The successful conclusion of an agreement will enable the Government to consider transposing the terms of the directive, including the framework agreement, in advance of the directive's deadline of end 2011.I will now outline the provisions of the Bill.  Section 7 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title and commencement of the Bill.  Section 2 sets out the main definitions associated with the Bill.  Section 3 defines the two types of employment agencies to which the Bill applies, that is, a "placement agency" and a "worker hire agency", often referred to as a temporary employment agency.  Section 4 empowers the Minister to make regulations prescribing, inter alia, the form of an application for an employment agency licence, the form of an employment agency licence and the fee, or fees, in respect of an employment agency licence application.Section 5 stipulates that any orders and regulations made by the Minister under the Bill, with the exception of an order made under section 1(2), must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.Section 6 is a standard provision stating that the expenses incurred by the Minister, in connection with the administration of the Bill, shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 7 sets out the procedures that apply to the service of documents under the Bill.Section 8 provides that a person guilty of an offence under the Bill shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, and on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €250,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both.Section 9 provides for the repeal of the Employment Agency Act 1971 and for the revocation of all regulations made under the Act.  Section 10 provides that to be eligible to apply for a licence a person must be established in the State or in another EEA state.  Agencies from outside the EEA wishing to offer a service in the State must establish in Ireland or in another EEA state.  The supply of personnel from outside the EEA will be subject to the employment permit requirements.  The section also provides that the Minister can refuse a licence in certain circumstances.Section 11 sets out the circumstances in which the Minister may revoke an employment agency licence.  Section 12 provides for the Minister to designate an EEA state as one which satisfies requirements for the licensing or otherwise regulation of, employment agencies in that EEA state.Section 13 provides for the prohibition by the Minister of a recognised employment agency from carrying on the business of an employment agency in the State or providing an employment agency service to a person in the State, in certain circumstances, for a period of up to three years.  Section 14 provides for the publication by the Minister on the Internet of a list of licensed employment agencies and recognised employment agencies.Section 15 provides for an appeal to the Circuit Court by applicants for a licence, or a licensed employment agency or a recognised employment agency in circumstances where the Minister has refused to grant a licence under section 10, revoked a licence under section 11 or prohibited a recognised employment agency from carrying on the business of an employment agency in the State or providing an employment agency service in the State, under section 13.Section 16 provides that the Minister may direct an employment agency in writing to provide to him or her, by a given date, information and documentation on the remuneration and hours of work of any of its employees in respect of any period of work of those employees with a hirer undertaking.In addition, the section provides that where a licensed or recognised employment agency contravenes a direction under this section, the Minister may serve a notice on the licensed employment agency informing it that its licence shall cease to have effect, which shall cease to have effect on service of the notice, and serve a notice on the recognised employment agency informing it that it is prohibited from carrying on business in the State or providing an employment agency service to a person in the State.  Finally, the section provides that a person shall be guilty of an offence if he or she contravenes a direction under this section.Section 17 provides that the Minister may make regulations requiring licensed and recognised employment agencies to prepare such records as may be specified in the regulations and to keep those records for such period of time specified in the regulations.  The section also provides that a person who contravenes the above requirements shall be guilty of an offence.Section 18 provides that the Minister shall publish, on the Internet, a list of employment agencies which have had their licences revoked under section 11 or which do not have effect in accordance with section 16 and of recognised employment agencies in respect of whom a prohibition notice under sections 13 or 16 is in force.  Section 19 provides that a person, other than a licensed employment agency or a recognised employment agency shall be guilty of an offence if he or she carries on the business of an employment agency in the State or provides an employment agency service to a person in the State or advertises or causes to be advertised the provision by him or her of an employment agency service.  This section also provides that a person, other than a licensed employment agency or recognised employment agency who holds himself or herself out as being a licensed employment agency or recognised employment agency, whether by advertisement or not, shall be guilty of an offence.Section 20 provides that it is an offence for a person to enter into an agreement with an employment agency for the provision of an employment agency service by that employment agency if it is not licensed or is not a recognised employment agency.  Similarly, it is an offence for a person if an unlicensed employment agency or an employment agency, which is not a recognised employment agency, provides an employment agency service to that person.  I hope what I say is clear.  It might sound like repetition but it is important that the provisions are clearly outlined.The section also provides that in proceedings for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for the accused to show that he or she did not know and could not, upon reasonable inquiry, have discovered that he or she was not dealing with a licensed employment agency or a recognised employment agency.Section 21 provides that a placement agency shall be guilty of an offence if it charges a job seeker a fee for providing its services to the job seeker, including training.  The section also provides that it shall be an offence for a person to employ a job seeker who has been charged a fee by a placement agency.  In addition, it is provided for that in proceedings for an offence under this section, it shall be a defence for a person to show that he or she did not know and had no reasonable grounds for believing that the placement agency had charged the job seeker employed by that person a fee for providing the job seeker with its services, including training.Section 22 provides that a licensed employment agency must produce its licence for inspection by an authorised officer on request, must display a copy of the licence prominently in its premises and that a person who contravenes this section shall be guilty of an offence.  Section 23 provides that a person who forges an employment agency licence, displays a forged licence knowing it to be forged, alters a licence with intent to defraud or deceive, displays an altered licence knowing it to be altered, produces a revoked licence to another person with intent to defraud or deceive or who has in his or her possession a forged or altered licence, without lawful authority, shall be guilty of an offence.Section 24 provides for the appointment of authorised officers by the Minister for the purposes of the Bill.  Section 25 sets out the powers of authorised officers, including the power to require certain records from persons who control workplaces.  Section 26 provides for the prosecution in absentia under section 50(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 of employment agencies from outside the State who have committed an offence in regard to one of their employees in the State under a specified enactment set out in Schedule 1 to the Bill, that is, industrial relations or employment rights legislation.Section 27 provides for the making by the Minister by order under the Bill of a code of practice relating to the conduct of employment agencies, after consultation with the advisory committee, to be set up under section 33 of the Bill.  Section 28 provides for administrative co-operation with foreign statutory bodies on issues which arise under the Bill.  Section 29 provides for the protection from civil liability of persons who report breaches of the Bill to the Minister or a member of the Garda Síochána.Section 30 provides that an employer shall not penalise or threaten penalisation against an employee for making a complaint to a member of the Garda Síochána about a breach of a provision of the Bill or giving evidence in any proceedings under the Bill.  The section also sets out what constitutes penalisation.Section 31 provides that if a person states to the Minister, or to a member of the Garda Síochána, that an offence under the Bill has been, or is being, committed or that a provision of the Bill is not being complied with, knowing the statement to be false, he or she shall be guilty of an offence.Section 32 provides that references to the Employment Agency Act 1971 in any enactment shall be construed as references to this Bill.  Section 33 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee, by the Minister, to advise and assist him or her on the performance of his or her functions under the Bill, and for the appointment of members of the committee, by the Minister.  Section 34 provides, inter alia, that on assuming membership of either House of the Oireachtas, European Parliament or local authority, such person shall cease to be a member of the advisory committee.Schedule 1 contains a list of specified enactments, that is, the body of industrial relations and employment rights legislation that applies, inter alia, to employment agency employees.  Schedule 2 sets out the redress mechanisms available to, inter alia, employment agency employees in the event that their employers are in breach of section 30(1) of the Bill.I commend the Bill to the House.  It resulted from discussions with the social partners.  It has been a long time in gestation.  Clarity was required in the context of our obligations under European Union treaties.  Much discussion took place at European Union level to achieve that clarity.  The Bill is a commitment to make sure exploitation is weeded out.  The issue was raised quite forcefully in discussions with the social partners, including in discussions I had with them when I had responsibility for labour affairs.  The legislation will deal with agencies or undertakings in Ireland that intend to use workers in an exploitative way.  I commend it.  There is broad support for ensuring agencies are well regulated but, equally important, for ensuring the triangular relationship between agencies, employees and the employers or undertakings functions and allows flexibility in the workforce.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I welcome the Bill and I offer my broad support for it on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  This legislation updates the 1971 Act.  I have been in contact with most of the stakeholders, including unions, employer bodies and employment agencies and there is broad support for the Bill, although a number of provisions may need to be refined or amended on Committee Stage.The purpose of the Bill is to require employment agencies to operate under a licence either from Ireland or another recognised EEA state.  It provides for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make codes of practice, establishes an advisory committee and provides for the protection of whistleblowers, the prosecution in absentia of employment agencies and the enforcement in other EEA countries of the decisions of rights commissioners, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It does not deal with the temporary agency workers directive, which has not been transposed into domestic law yet but I imagine that will be subject to legislation at a later stage.I am slightly concerned that some of the Bill's provisions may be contrary to the provisions of the Single Market and the Internal Market.  The Minister of State referred to this in his contribution and I am sure he has advice on this but I have not seen it, as I am never given access to such advice.  I will seek my own legal advice on these provisions.Section 12 is a little strange.  It allows the Minister to designate certain EEA states but not others for licensing.  It is not clear how the Minister intends to exercise those powers.  I do not fully understand how, in a Single Market, some states can be designated and not others.  For example, a number of states have a licensing regime and others do not.  The UK does not have such a regime for licensing employment agencies and, instead, supervision is used.  Does that mean it will not be possible to recognise the UK?  I can understand how another state with a licensing regime could be identified and its licences recognised but how does that apply to EEA states that do not have such a regime?  Will they be excluded from participating in the Irish market?  Will they have to apply, therefore, for a licence in Ireland?  Will countries that do not have a licensing regime be recognised anyway because of European Single Market legislation?  Ireland could up end recognising all employment agencies based in Romania because it only has a supervision system and not a licensing system, in which case nothing at all would be achieved.  I would like clarity on this issue.Section 13(1)(b), according to the explanatory memorandum, will allow the Minister to refuse a licence to an employment agency on the basis that offences were committed in another state that would have been illegal in Ireland.  That is a strange provision.  An employment agency operating entirely within the law in another state but doing something that would be illegal if it happened in Ireland can be refused a licence.  I find it difficult to understand how that would stand up in the courts if anyone were to challenge it.  For example, in this State it is illegal to sell fireworks but it is legal to do so in other countries.  This is similar to saying to a retail outlet such as Spar, which might sell fireworks in Germany, that it cannot operate there because they do something that is legal in Germany but illegal in Ireland.   Such a provision will not stand up in court if it is challenged.  I would like to see the legal advice on that if the Minister of State is willing to make it available to my office.Section 3 defines the terms "employee" and "employer" and then it refers to worker hire agencies.  This issue of defining "workers" and "employees" separately in legislation has been raised previously but if references are being made to employers and employees in the Bill, would it not make more sense to refer to an employee hire agency or to define "worker"?Section 10 provides that for an agency to be eligible to apply for a licence, a person must be established in the State or in another EEA state.  However, it does not set conditions regarding what kind of person may establish an employment agency.  It might be appropriate to consider this in the legislation.  For example, it does not require that the person should have a qualification such as a human resources or business degree.  They must be persons of good standing but no requirement is set that they should have the ability to run an agency.  It is strange that this would be not the case in a licensing regime.  If one applies for a licence to drive a car, for instance, one must pass a test to secure a qualification.  The section permits individuals to establish a worker hire agency or a placement agency without any qualifications or without passing a test.  That is a potential deficiency in the legislation.The UK has a supervision regime rather than a licensing regime.  Will that be considered to be acceptable by the Minister?  Does she consider supervisory regimes to be the equivalent of a licensing regime?  Section 10 also uses the term "established in the State".  I do not know what that means in law.  I have never seen it defined in law, particularly not in regard to employment agencies.  I am not a lawyer but Deputy Penrose is and perhaps he can advise the House but I have never seen the term used before.  Why is it not defined?  Will the Minister of State clarify what it means in order that the good justices when they deal with matters under this legislation will be able to read the Second Stage debate to ascertain what the Minister of State meant by "established in the State"?Section 21 prevents a placement agency from being guilty of an offence if it charges a jobseeker a fee for providing services, including training.  I question whether this is necessary.  I do not doubt placement agencies charge people when they should not and that should not be tolerated.  The licence of an agency that does this should be revoked.  However, if an agency provides training, I do not see why it should not be able to charge for this.  The jobseeker does not have to take up the training and, therefore, pay the fee.  Why should it be illegal for a placement agency to provide training?  Why should a training and placement agency in the State be an illegal entity, which it would be under this legislation?  For example, if a placement agency reviewed and improved a person's curriculum vitae, which is often done, it cannot charge for that service and I do not see why that should be the case.  It is up to the individual whether he or she wants to pay for the service and I do not see why it should be an offence.  The same applies to interview preparation.  We have no difficulty with agencies charging large sums to do interview preparation for job applicants.  I do not fully understand why it should be illegal for agencies providing this service to charge for it.It is a step too far to make it an offence for the employer to knowingly hire somebody who was charged for such a service.  Ultimately, these things are the responsibility of the person and of the service provider.  If the person pays for it, it is his or her own business; if the provider charges for it, it is its own business.  The last thing we should do is to criminalise a third party, which this Bill would do.  It would criminalise an employer who hired an employee while being aware that he or she had some exchange of moneys with the placement agency, even if it was for something as simple as a fee for interview preparation.Section 24 provides for the appointment of authorised officers by the Minister for the purpose of the Bill.  I would be interested to know exactly which officers will be enforcing this Bill.  Will they be officers of the Department or of NERA?  The legislation also allows the Minister to appoint an agency to do this job, although it does not specify the agency.  Will it be NERA or another agency?  Should the agency not be named?  Will there be a number of different agencies?  The Minister might clarify that.  Section 25 gives these authorised officers from the mystery agency extensive powers, to which I might return on Committee Stage.Section 30 deals with penalisation.  There is some concern about the definition of penalisation and I know the Minister will receive a number of submissions with regard to how the term "penalisation" is defined.  The Minister of State may wish to consider this.  It is all very well to have protection against penalisation, but they do need to be well defined.  There is also no protection from penalisation for involvement in trade union activity; this is something that could be included in the Bill.  People who are being hired through employment agencies will probably not be unionised, but I do not see any reason they should not be permitted to join a union if they so wish.  This is different from obliging the employer to recognise a union.  There may be a case for rewording the definition of penalisation to explain it better.Section 33 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee, for which I question the necessity.  I know Ministers love setting up boards, advisory committees, task forces and so on; there is nothing they like more.  They are the international masters.  If there was an Olympics of setting up committees, Fianna Fáil would win it every time.  If it is necessary to set up an advisory committee, I do not think it should be set up on the FÁS model, as provided for in the Bill.  The committee will consist of two employee representatives, two employer representatives, two civil servants, two people representing employment agencies, and two cronies.  This is not the way it should be set up.  We brought legislation through the House to change the way the FÁS board was appointed and, although the positions should have been scrutinised, Fine Gael supported the Bill in principle and did not vote against it.  I do not understand why the Minister is now going back——

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I am referring to ministerial appointees, which is a legal term for cronies.  That is exactly what they will be.  One thing that has shocked me is the behaviour of the Green Party.  Since the last local elections the Green Party has appointed at least seven failed election candidates to State boards.  It has even set up a whole new Green quango, the Foras Orgánach, to facilitate its members.  I published a Private Members' Bill, the Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2008, which was voted down in the House.  At least Fianna Fáil was honest about it; its members voted it down because they did not think it was necessary.  However, the Green Party went the other way, saying it did not go far enough.  It secured a commitment in the programme for Government — which is not in the legislative schedule, incidentally — that the Government would introduce legislation to change the way public appointments are made.  Since then it has engaged in the most appalling acts of cronyism, which would bring shame to the sleaziest member of Fianna Fáil.The way in which the Green Party members have behaved is sickening and appalling.  They are doing their best to pack committees and boards with failed Green Party election candidates.  It was Deputy Gilmore who described the Green Party as being like hitchhikers in the Fianna Fáil car — ready to be thrown out at the next crossroads.  However, the relationship is different.  Fianna Fáil is the driving instructor and the Green Party members are the learner drivers, and it has taught them well.  The cronyism in which they are engaging is disgusting.  The Green Party will stay in Government for as long as possible so it can pack every board with its members.  It will put all of its 200 members on various State agency boards or committees and then it will bring in the legislation it has promised for some time.  I have no doubt the advisory committee we are discussing will include a Green Party associate or perhaps a failed candidate from that party.  That is why I do not believe it should be constituted in that way.  I do not see why we would pass legislation to change the way one board is set up and then go back to the old model.I would also like some clarity on the expenses and allowances that are referred to in the Bill.  Traditionally, members of an advisory committee receive expenses to defray the costs associated with being part of the advisory committee; they do not receive unvouched allowances, which are a form of payment.  I would be interested to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to give money to these people as well as covering their expenses.Section 34 prevents Oireachtas Members, MEPs and members of local authorities from being appointed to the advisory committee, a provision which occurs in a number of Acts.  This might be a problem for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who likes to break this provision.  The Minister of State may recall that Deputy Gormley tried to break the law by appointing two sitting Green Party councillors to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  However, they have since lost their seats, so, like every other failed Green Party candidate, they will be appointed to something if they have not been already.  In fact, I am sure they have already been appointed to something.

I am saying that the members of a party that preached that line for ten years and voted down a Bill containing such provisions on the basis that it did not go far enough are hypocrites.  I am happy to stand over that in any forum whatsoever.  At least Fianna Fáil does not pretend anything; its members are clear on where they stand on this issue.  It is the Green Party members who are hypocrites — on this issue, on the banking inquiry — you name it.  Never has a party sold itself so cheaply.  One can see it now with the cronyism and hypocrisy it is demonstrating across the board.  It is shocking.  As somebody who often gave my number two to the Green Party, I will certainly never do so again.The exclusion of local authority members from the advisory board under section 34 is not necessary.  It is probably appropriate not to have Oireachtas Members or MEPs on the advisory committee, but it may be appropriate for a member of a local authority, if he or she is suitably qualified, to be appointed.  Of course, local authority members have been elected.  It is ironic that if one is elected one cannot be on an advisory committee but if one could not get any votes and one is a Green Party member one is almost automatically appointed.  That provision should be removed.  I do not see why the entire body of a thousand town, city and county councillors should be excluded by statute from the advisory committee and I will be proposing to remove that provision on Committee Stage.I mentioned the different definitions of "employee" and "worker".  There is one other aspect of the Bill that is worthy of mention, to which I referred already in connection with sections 12 and 13.  Section 13(1)(b) states that the type of employment agency that would not be permitted to carry out business in the State would be one that:is convicted of an offence in a state other than the State, and the acts or omissions of which that offence consists would, if committed in the State, constitute an offence under the law of the State and be prosecutable—(i) on indictment, or(ii) summarily or, at the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions, on indictment,or(c) contravenes a condition contained in a direction of the Circuit Court under section 15(6)(b)
Perhaps I am misreading it, but it seems to mean that if an employment agency that was totally compliant in another state did something that would have been illegal in this State it could be barred from obtaining a licence.  If that is the case, it will not stand up to legal challenge.  I would like to see the legal advice on that.This Bill is essentially a replacement of the Employment Agency Act 1971.  It is not a large Bill but it is necessary, and we will support it broadly.  However, I have concerns about the particular points I mentioned, and we will be tabling amendments on those issues on Committee Stage.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Employment Agency Regulation Bill 2009 and to indicate our broad agreement with and support for it.  As Deputy Varadkar said, we have significant amendments to table on Committee State to ensure the Bill is strengthened and made fit for purpose.  It is no use allowing legislation to meander its way through here, we should all make a contribution to ensure its purpose is effected in a real way and that its objectives are secured.The Bill aims to regulate and supervise the provision of employment agency services and, as stated, it repeals the Employment Agency Act 1971, providing for a system of licensing for employment agencies that more aptly reflects the current labour market activities and circumstances.  It provides for the establishment of a statutory code of practice setting down the minimum standards for employment agencies and for the setting up an advisory committee to oversee the sector in an advisory capacity; a cynic might say "Not another one".  I wonder about all these advisory committees.  These are a way of saying that those charged with the initial responsibility for legislation have no input.  It is as if there is a vacuum.  The Government is always collecting advice but when legislation is brought forward, there should be clear intent and purpose about its objectives and there should not be any need for advisory committees.The Bill also makes provision for prosecutions to proceed in absentia in certain cases.  That provision, under the Brussels convention, makes for the facilitation of enforcement, a critical element for prosecutions and the enforcement of results.  The Bill will enhance and strengthen the regulatory framework for the operation of employment agencies in Ireland and the Labour Party endorses the introduction of this modern legislation.  We have significant issues, however, with certain aspects and will submit amendments to address them.We welcome the significant change that will require any employment agency offering a service in the State, wherever it is based, to be licensed in Ireland, unless otherwise licensed and registered in a member state of the European Economic Area.  This is further strengthened by the provision to revoke the licences of employment agencies and prohibit them from operating in Ireland for stated and specific reasons.  The licensing of employment agencies is an important issue for workers and indeed trade unions, particularly where significant numbers of new jobs are filled by employment agencies.  This issue was discussed by ICTU, which has expressed concerns about it.The licensing system will not be a problem for the many employment agencies that operate to the highest standards here but once this legislation is put in place it will ensure every agency that operates is fit and proper.  The trade unions have been concerned to ensure the protection of vulnerable agency workers and modernisation of the relevant legislation was a commitment made in Towards 2016, the review and transition agreement referred to by the Minister of State in his opening speech.  While the legislation incorporates a number of the commitments made in the Towards 2016 review and transition agreement, ICTU and the Labour Party have noted significant commitments that were given have not been included in the Bill.  We will pursue those.In section 8(6) of the transition agreement, a commitment was given that would prohibit the use of agency workers to replace striking workers.  In July 2009, the Government gave a commitment that it would bring forward an amendment to make it unlawful for employers to use agency workers for this purpose.  The Minister of State's answer is that the Government is approving the drafting of a provision along those lines for inclusion in the Bill.  I am worried about this.  The commitment was given seven months ago.  Why is the text of it not here before us so we can scrutinise it and indicate our support or opposition to it?The advisory committee will prepare for the Minister's consideration a code of practice to guide behaviour in the sector.  It is important that compliance would be required with a statutory code of practice as a condition of licensing and would establish those operating agencies are fit to do so.  This was another commitment given to the unions in section 21(2) of Towards 2016.A further issue that has arisen is that amendments are needed to provide for a complaint and redress mechanism for employees.  There are all sorts of areas included in the Bill but there are also others that are not covered.  The Minister of State will claim that section 30 provides for redress but I do not see that engagement in trade union activity or the recognition of the right to be involved in the trade union movement are included.It is critically important to the trade union movement that the legislation would give an entitlement and a way for workers to recover money when they have been unlawfully charged fees by the agency or employer.  What is the position on the terms of registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders that we discussed at length recently?  Will these agreements and orders apply to employment agencies and agency workers?  That is a vital matter that must be clarified to our satisfaction.  We will be tabling an amendment to ensure their inclusion otherwise the legislation we discussed previously will be left to one side.We are confronted frequently with the question of who is the employer of the agency worker.  It is important to everyone concerned that the legislation clarifies who is responsible.  Legislation arose from a High Court case in 1986 about end users and employers.  It is easy to shift responsibility from one person to another.There is a need for an explicit amendment to ensure observance of employment equality rights to prohibit employment equality avoidance practices such as profiling or other activities that undermine equality rights.  In some EU states there is a requirement for agencies to place a bond analogous to that of tour operators.  The Bill allows for this to safeguard moneys received by agencies for and on behalf of workers in the event that an agency goes bankrupt and to provide assistance to workers who are posted away and thereby ensure they are not left stranded and can be repatriated as quickly as possible.  That must be clarified and must include measures to ensure people's money is safeguarded in the event of an agency going bankrupt.The Labour Party is focused on the transposition of the EU directive.  The Minister of State referred to it and I have spoken about it extensively in this House.  I even introduced a Bill to achieve that some time ago.  When implemented it would put an end to the situation whereby agency workers get less pay and are given worse conditions than permanent staff, and would guarantee agency workers are entitled to equal treatment, pay and conditions as permanent employees.  The Minister of State is facilitating meetings with the social partners on that and I welcome that.  I hope those negotiations will prove fruitful.In response to a number of issues brought to my attention by the trade union movement, it was suggested that legislation should address other significant issues.  The Long Title of the Bill should be amended to include a reference to the International Labour Organisation convention 181 on private employment agencies.  The EU Commission has called on member states to ratify this convention.  This Bill could offer an ideal opportunity for Ireland to ratify the convention because it is unlikely there will be a more advantageous point in the legislative calendar to pursue this.The Bill states the Minister can bring into being any parts or sections at different times.  What is the Minister's intention regarding these commencements?  Sections could be left forever without there being an order for commencement, which means they would be ineffective.  The legislation would be neutralised, lying on the floor.Section 3 refers to two types of employment agency to which the Bill applies.  Will the Bill capture all employment agencies' activities?  It should not permit licensing requirements to be circumvented.  It may be necessary to provide for some exemption in, for example, the local employment service, various not-for-profit organisations and transition year work placements in secondary schools, which constitute a new area that did not exist in our time.  Taking account of these would be important.Section 8 provides that a person guilty of an offence is liable for a fine of up to €5,000 and-or 12 months of imprisonment on summary conviction or a fine of up to €250,000 and-or three years of imprisonment on conviction by indictment.  In 1971, the maximum fine was £50, so this level of deterrent to transgression is welcome and moving with the times.Subsection 8(3) provides that only the Minister can prosecute offences under the legislation.  Were there any prosecutions under the 1971 Act?  I believe there were none.  Who will be the prosecuting authority?  What of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA?  I understand that the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 will be before the House next month.  If NERA is to have a supervisory role in that regard, should it not also have a role in the enforcement of this legislation?  Whatever authority will be set up under the compliance Bill should also have a role in initiating prosecutions in this regard.Section 9 repeals the Employment Agency Act 1971, but the fact that the agencies licensed under that Act can continue for three years means there could be parallel licensing systems, namely, the 1971 system until 2013 and the 2010 system onwards.  One must allow people to get their affairs in order, as no one wants to wave a baton at people immediately, but perhaps a year or 18 months would be sufficient.I referred to section 10 in respect of the bond.  It is important that there be a bond similar to the one imposed by the Commission for Aviation Regulation on all tour operators and travel agents, based on their turnovers, before they can be licensed.  This matter should be considered in the context of this Bill.Section 11 sets out the circumstances in which the Minister might revoke a licence.  At least two additional grounds should be considered for the purpose of revocation, namely, where an agency fails to comply with a statutory code of practice or where there are consistent or serious breaches of health and safety or other employment rights.  Their inclusion would strengthen the Bill.Deputy Varadkar has addressed section 12, which provides that the Minister can designate a European Economic Area, EEA, state as one that satisfies the licensing requirements.  Does this mean that agencies could operate in Ireland without the need for a licence under this legislation?  The Bill sets out that EEA countries will only be designated if they have a similar licensing regime.  This is a positive development, but it will not reduce the likelihood of forum shopping.  Deputy Varadkar wondered how the Minister would establish the similarities between licensing systems' requirements.  In England, the system is a supervisory one.  Some work remains to be done to seek clarification in terms of how this provision will operate, as it is a cause for concern.Under section 16, the Minister may direct an agency to provide him or her with information.  I have a feeling about the word "may" in this context, in that it should be "shall".  Providing the information should be mandatory.  I remember working on this matter previously.  Not only the Minister should be furnished with a report, though.  A report would be useful and I welcome the thrust of the section, but regular annual reports should be made to the Minister and he or she should lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas and their relevant committees.  When we advocated such a system in respect of the Bill on financial services provisions that we discussed just before Christmas, the Minister of State accepted it.  That provision should be included in this legislation.  The same request applies to section 17, under which the Minister may make regulations to require an agency to keep records.  Surely the Minister is obliged to require the keeping of records and the identification of an employer in the State.In the construction of legislation, "may" is sometimes read as "shall".  This is an unusual aspect of interpretation.  When legislation is being examined by the courts, there are schematic-teleological interpretations.  They consider literal meanings first, then consider what is stated in the Chamber to ascertain the legislation's objective, as Deputy Varadkar said.  The Minister of State could put the question beyond doubt and focus on setting a mandatory requirement for the maintenance of records.Various sections make provisions in respect of the offence of carrying out an employment agency service without a licence.  This is useful.Under section 24, the Minister may appoint authorised officers.  If NERA is to be a part of the Labour Inspectorate, could we not give it an investigative and enforcement role or will other agencies be involved?  What officers will the Minister appoint?  The Government is in the usual conundrum, in that the legislation will pass Second Stage but has not reached finality because it must still go to Committee Stage in the next month or so.  As such, perhaps the Minister of State is not in a position to explain whether NERA will have a role.  Could he clarify the situation for the House?Section 29 is welcome.  Indeed, the Labour Party, in particular Deputy Rabbitte while he was our leader, tabled whistleblower protection legislation.  It lay moribund for a considerable period notwithstanding his efforts to have it promoted.  In fairness, this legislation is the second Bill to take account of it.  The Minister of State's Department has certainly taken it on board.  For example, whistleblower legislation was introduced in the Labour Services (Amendment) Act 2009 and is now being included in this Bill.  However, it is being restricted, as it only applies to informing the Garda and similar bodies.  I could report a complaint to the body designated to enforce this legislation, be it NERA or another statutory authority, but the protection umbrella only applies to complaints to the Minister and the Garda.  If I complain to an authorised body or officer, will that protection be extended to me?  If the agency worker is a member of a trade union, which makes a complaint on the worker's behalf, does the protection extend to the third party?  Those are the types of question I would like given some serious thought.  The broad thrust of section 29 should be welcomed.Section 30 provides that an employer shall not penalise an employee for blowing the whistle, which is important.  There will be no recrimination against somebody who blows the whistle in good faith.  I accept that the Minister has circumscribed it in the legislation that the action must be in good faith, and somebody cannot act in a fit of pique.  There must be bona fide grounds for a complaint and I would not be very happy with any piece of legislation allowing untrammeled rights to make a complaint without any sustained or substantial basis.  There should be a bona fide reason for a complaint.  All types of blacklisting practices by employment agencies should be prohibited and set out thus in the legislation.Section 33 refers to the advisory committee and Deputy Varadkar has spoken about that.  I can understand that no members of the Dáil, Seanad or European Parliament can be part of the advisory committee, which is correct and accepted.  Should being a member of a local authority preclude a person from being part of an advisory committee?  Some members of a local authority may have a significant degree of expertise in the labour law area but would be excluded from participation in the committee as a result of being members of a local authority.I will not hammer the issue at the Minister of State forever and a day but members of a local authority may have a degree of proficiency in the area that would be useful to an advisory committee.  They could participate in that regard.  I remember members of local authorities from all parties being appointed to various boards and they brought a significant degree of expertise to those boards and made significant contributions.Schedule 1 contains the specified enactments applying to agency workers.  I know the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was concerned about who was the legal employer of an agency worker.  It is clear from this and by extension other legislation that an agency worker has virtually the full umbrella of protection from labour legislation and employment rights.  There is no argument about that.  The problem is who will be responsible, as the agency and end-user employer could both claim they are not responsible.  It is very important that we clarify that point beyond all doubt.  It is a simple formula in my view as whoever pays the wages should be responsible.  It is sine qua non.The Minister of State knows there are significant contractual extensions of the employment chain, and there may be cross-border posting and complex payment systems.  Trying to get around to the person paying the wages can be quite difficult.  An amendment to the legislation to provide that the end user is normally responsible should be considered.I have already indicated that amendments are needed to ensure that equality avoidance in profiling and practice by employment agencies would not take place.  The Minister of State should be eager to ensure this does not happen.  Apart from those observations, this is important legislation and it has been set out clearly.  I look forward to an amendment being tabled with regard to strikes, which will ensure that there cannot be substitution of agency workers in the case of a genuine strike where all the normal procedures have been gone through.The Labour Party broadly welcomes the advent of this legislation and we will bring forward amendments to improve it.  They will convey some of the views I expressed today.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I also welcome this Bill and the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, is present.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, is responsible for the portfolio but I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, would have been involved in the preparation of the legislation.The Bill is welcome because the last piece of legislation to regulate employment agencies was in 1971 and the world has changed since then.  Employment law and the people covered by it have changed and we clearly need an updated law regarding these institutions.  There are many exemplary facets to the Bill.It was as a result of the Towards 2016 discussions that this Bill was promised, and that shows good intent on behalf of the Minister of State responsible for labour affairs, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Government in ensuring that the rightful wishes of the trade unions and employers, as evidenced in this Bill, were listened to and acted upon.  It showed good intent for the future of such talks.I came in towards the end of the contribution by my constituency colleague but as far as I could gather, he was speaking about the hope that talks could reconvene and that, in particular, goodwill is still evident despite lying low at the moment.  There is a well of it still there between employers, trade unions, the Government and other pillars.  The talks could be revived.I watched Vincent Browne's programme last night and it was very interesting.  He asked Mr. Blair Horan about his use of the word "revisit", as Mr. Horan indicated his union wanted to revisit the 2010 budget.  Speaking for myself, we should not revisit the budget.  Mr. Horan stuck to his guns and argued that the parties could talk through the issues again.  Mr. Kieran Mulvey of the Labour Relations Commission was on television and radio last Sunday week talking about an initiative he has taken to explore how the thoughts and outlook for talks could be kept fluid in order to avoid a truncated version of social partnership.  This would avoid the bother of taking it from cold storage and revising it too late, perhaps when December dawns this year.  I hope the Labour Relations Commission and this Bill will show that the Government has good intent towards those talks and will seek to bring into effect the legislative side of agreements that have been reached.Many of these agreements are of a technical nature, and I know that Deputy Penrose speaks for his party on these matters.  I am speaking as a person interested in all matters relating to employment.  Anything that would regulate agencies such as that and take a more rounded approach to those it seeks to employ would be very worthwhile.  I particularly liked the clause about the whistleblower.  I am aware that in the past, there was much commotion about a whistleblowers' Bill, and the Government did not agree with it at the time.  This is the second such Bill in which the whistleblower clause has been included.  That is a very good start in bringing such an operation into legislation.  A person who has information that is injurious to others within that particular system should have the chance to blow the whistle and offset other damages that may occur.I spoke briefly about FÁS to the Minister at the parliamentary party meeting the other night.  We are talking about employment legislation, and I think this topic comes under that heading.  All the talk about FÁS has been about the expenses and it went on endlessly.  Of course it was outrageous and I am glad the PAC and the Comptroller and Auditor General unearthed it.  There is a firm promise on behalf of the board and the chairman that they will be good from now on.  Such carry-on should not be allowed.  However, there is a far more fundamental issue in respect of FÁS which has not been raised.  We got sporadic accounts in the newspapers that a particular trainer had given a course and that there were now doubts about the training standards at that course.  That all disappeared from view when the issue of the expenses was again brought up.  I would be far more concerned about the need for authorisation and recognition of all the courses that have been provided across FÁS.  Young people are told that the world is their oyster if they get the certification in their hands.  If that certification is recognised elsewhere, that might be the case.I do not wish to deny the great work of regular FÁS trainers and workers.  I know many of them and they are fine people, but these appear to be bodies which FÁS brought in to give courses for a particular specialisation or profession.  I would be very worried if there is no authoritative verification of the various courses carried out under its aegis.  The holders of such certification should be able to travel the world in the belief that it entitles them to the recognition they are supposed to have.There is a new CEO in FÁS and I met him in Mullingar to bestow certifications.  I urge the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Minister of State to institute a very authoritative review of all those courses over which doubts have been cast in order that the holders of certificates in those courses can be assured they have the proper qualifications.  Parents have come to see me about this and it gave me a sense of unease any time I came across it.  I felt something was not quite right about it, yet I saw no follow up on it.There is a very big drop in the number of young people taking up apprenticeships.  I know that an apprentice must be registered with an employer, and that is understandable as there is no other way to get the experience.  I know that there was a measure last autumn whereby those who had entered into phase four were allowed to continue their course in some fashion.  However, what is much more important now is the low level of numbers undertaking apprenticeships.  If we are to have corners rounded and if we are to look to brighter horizons, we do not want the situation that occurred some years ago, in which we suddenly found we had no plumbers, carpenters or whatever.  We need to ensure proper planning is done and I would like to see a fully fledged apprenticeship system in place again.  When I was Minister of State for labour affairs, I brought in what is still called the new apprenticeship system.  We ended up with a properly structured course of studies for all apprentices.I am glad to have the opportunity to bring up these matters.  They are of huge importance in the State training agency, and are of far more importance than the brouhaha that went on over matters.  That has been rectified, but my concern is with the people who went on courses and were told they were getting a standardised qualification.  Are they still getting it and are there any new courses?  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me latitude and the opportunity to speak on this matter.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this relatively important Bill.  The Bill was published last July, but it was agreed to address the issue under the Towards 2016 process.  I got the impression from my research that there was a commitment this would happen three or four years ago.  I often wonder why things take so long, especially when a Bill like this is relatively simple and most people agree with it.  I do not understand why Bills slowly seep in here, when we could have put them to bed a long time ago.The main purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the regulatory framework for the operation of employment agency services by requiring them to have a licence to operate an agency.  I agree with some of the comments from ICTU on this.  I do not know why everybody should not be required to have a licence.  I have a difficulty with the idea that agencies with licences in their own EU state can operate here without an Irish licence.  I have a difficulty with that because it leaves the issue open to different rules for different countries and it is not clear how that will happen.  I accept there will be a difficulty addressing this due to other EU directives, but if we cannot have a licence for every agency operating here, we should at least have an assessment of the licences agencies already have.  Some of the trade unions have suggested that a fast track approach be taken to endorsing an agency of another country.  It is wrong to say the company does not need a licence specifically granted by this country.  We either have it or we do not.This is an important Bill.  Many agencies are still operating in Ireland.  Figures for the past year show 300 to 400 employment agencies or companies operating here.  Prior to the 2007 general election we were invited to meetings about abuse of agency workers.  I thought this Bill might deal with that matter but it does not.  It deals with agencies and that is one step that may fix many of the problems that exist.  We are changing the working environment in our country and this may lead to problems going away.  There was definitely abuse of people working for agencies.  All the authorities and organisations we have cannot catch everyone so it is important to have whistleblower legislation in order that people can speak up.  Even when legislation is in place, people are still unsure where to go for help and are still afraid to speak up.  It is important we monitor the situation and follow this up with further legislation to protect and grant more rights and entitlements to the agency worker.I cannot agree with all of the unions' recommendations for the rights of agency workers but there must be some clarification on when workers gain entitlements.  I do not agree with Deputy Willie Penrose, who expressed the view in previous debates that agency workers deserve full entitlements immediately.  There is a case to be made for a number of months to pass before they gain entitlements.  That is not addressed in this Bill but it should be.If an agency contravened the provisions of the Bill the Minister will be empowered to prohibit the company from carrying on a business for a period of up to three years.  Why the period of three years?  I am very blunt; I would say never again.  It depends on how bad the abuse is.  Is the period limited to three years?  Can one point out that the agency blatantly went against all the rules and should be restricted for a period longer than three years?  In some cases the licence may lapse or there might be another minor reason a company does not have a licence.  Is there some flexibility or is a three-year period set in stone?  What happens if the owners of an agency set up another agency under a different name and reapply for a licence?  Can the Minister note the name of the owner of the past agency?  It is not that difficult to set up a new agency or a new company in this country.  We must be careful of this.  Will it be similar to the disqualification of a director?  This must be strong law or there is no point in having it.  It is not clear from reading the Bill whether this point is provided for.  I did not hear all the speech of the Minister of State and perhaps he dealt with this point.  However, it must be clarified.Do I understand correctly that the agency cannot provide training or charge a fee?  The agency makes its profits through the worker being employed.  I would like to hear the logic behind that because it seems a little harsh.  Some agencies automatically provide training or another section of the company may provide the training.  If one wants to bring in workers and get them fixed for the job, one may want to organise training.

I hope some common sense applies to the point of whether agencies can train employees.The preparation of the code of practice is a good idea.  Will Deputies have a say?  The advisory board will not involve Members but I presume the Minister of State is happy that the code of practice can come before the committee and it can sign off on it.  As Deputies, we are invited to these meetings and people lobby us for changes.  Deputies have useful input on this matter.  Deputies and councillors should be on advisory committees and boards.  We are elected to do a job for the people and although there is a danger of partisan politics, Deputies should be used more often on State boards and bodies.  That would cut down costs because we are already paid to be here.  We could do other work at the same time and broaden our job.  That in itself would provide more scrutiny.  This matter may be too minor but in principle I am not opposed to any politician of any party being used on State boards and organisations.  That is what we are there for, to scrutinise.  There is too much of a tendency to take politicians away from this.The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has raised the issue that only the Minister can prosecute an offence, not NERA, the body set up to scrutinise abuse.  Am I reading this correctly?  The last item of legislation, the 1971 Act, was for a different purpose but very few people were prosecuted under that Act.  In fact, nobody was prosecuted.  That does not look good for the future if no one was prosecuted in 35 years.  This addressed a different matter, where people were going from this country to work abroad, whereas this Bill addresses agency workers in this country.  I would like to know who exactly can prosecute under this Bill.  I do not see why it should be only the Minister.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Someone can be refused a licence for reasons on indictment in this State or another state.  Three or four categories are set out in the Bill.  Is the licence automatically refused in these cases or does discretion exists?  Is it black or white?  Discretion is important because an agency may have branches located in various countries and abuse of workers may occur in one branch.  The Irish branch of the agency may be 100% straight in what it does and compliant with Irish law.  Does the Minister have discretion in this point?  I am not implying that the Minister of State does not have common sense but we must write this into law.  It must be written into law because the Minister of State will not be there forever, especially if Fine Gael gets its way.  The Oireachtas should have a role in setting out the principle of this point and we can deal with that on Committee Stage.  Certain points need to be tidied up.I feel very strongly about the licensing situation in this country.  An agency should be required to get a licence under Irish jurisdiction if it wants to set up in this country.  We must have control of this.  Why bring forward laws if we do not enforce them?  People have been treated very badly in the past.  Members have met them when they come into our offices looking for help.  It is difficult for Members to know where to go with some of these matters.  I accept it is getting easier to find the right place to go but it can be awkward because they are very often coming in from companies we know.  It is awkward but we have a duty to deal with this.  The clearer the law is, the easier it will be for us to follow procedures.  I suggest including in this Bill a requirement for any public representative of any party at any level to bring it to the attention of the relevant authority.  There should be an onus on us rather than allowing us to decide to park it on our office desk.  It is important that people are treated properly in the workplace and not abused.I welcome comments from the Minister of State, Dara Calleary, who proposes to introduce amendments so that agency workers cannot be brought in when people are on strike.  Will this be a feature of the Bill?  It shows how agency staff can be used and abused to fill a gap.Another point relates to how agency staff are treated by permanent staff.  The second part of the legislation, which deals with entitlements, may put some of these issues to bed.  If workers think agency staff have lesser rights than they do, it can be abused.  It is a pity that happens.  It would be necessary to have legislation to deal with this immediately and to set out the entitlements in black and white.  There is no reason this should go on for years.  The EU legislation came into force in 2008 and Ireland was one of the countries which delayed the passing of that legislation.  I never fully understand the reason we delayed progress in that area.We can learn from the example of other countries which have regularised the employment agency sector and which may have a longer history of using employment agencies to source staff.  This has become a significant issue in Ireland, particularly in the construction sector in the past three to five years and since EU enlargement in 2004.  Ireland has been slow to react.I have been an employer and I also have experience of being an employee so I know both sides.  One must be black and white with regard to employment law.  This is a reasonable Bill and will be a good Bill with a few changes but it will not inflict massive costs on any employer.  The employer organisations seem to be happy with the Bill as it does not impose a burden.  I know the Minster of State, Deputy Kelleher, is in favour of not imposing too much red tape on the sector.I understand the duty is on the employer to check whether an agency is licensed and that the point of contact is the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  If an employer contacts the Department, how quickly will he or she receive a response and will that response be in writing or will the information be available as a list on a website?  If an employer contacts the Department and is informed the agency in question has a licence and can be used, can the employer be assured that the list and the information is up to date?  An employer often needs to make a decision over a weekend or decides on a Monday that a person is needed for the week and he or she is unable to wait hours for an answer or a week to wait for a letter in the post.  It should not be the case of waiting for Deputies to submit parliamentary questions which will not be answered, because the information will be needed immediately and should be up to date.  There is no point in a list that is a year out of date.  Does the legislation indicate the duration of an employment agency licence?
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Like the previous speaker I welcome the Bill.  I assume the reason for this legislation is to follow best practice as in European legislation.  The structure of employment agencies has changed over the years.  I assume if this Bill had been introduced before the arrival of so many immigrant workers over the past eight or ten years it would be a different structure.  I see no reason the employment agencies would not be policed and a licensing system for agencies is a reasonable proposal.The movement of labour between countries comes in 20 to 30-year phases.  I presume this Bill is a measure to protect people who come to a foreign country and who might be very badly treated if suitable employment laws were not in place.  It is the case that a grey area exists within the employment agency business and this has nothing to do with non-native workers.  In the good years the use of employment agency staff could be very expensive.  I often wondered who was responsible for these staff, whether it was the agency that provided them or the employer who paid for them.  It is referred to as a grey area in some of the documentation.  I assume once this legislation is passed, this grey area will no longer exist.  I assume the people who pay the piper will be responsible for such staff and I note the Minister of State is nodding in agreement.Deputy Mary O'Rourke referred in her contribution to an unintended secondary effect of the legislation.  I hope this will do its bit in so far as the trade union movement is concerned, that it will show that the Oireachtas and the Government, like the trade unions, are also very concerned about the welfare of workers.  This comes at an opportune time when everybody is fiercely critical of everything that is happening and there is great cynicism as to the future of the country.  Whatever hope we have as a nation of pulling together, we have no hope at all if we hang one another out to dry.  It is against this background — even though this is only a very small element of a significant problem — that I hope it will be seen in some quarters that at least the Oireachtas Members wish to be prime movers in creating an environment for getting the economy right so that the people who are hurting so badly now will see that times will get better for them.  Parts of this Bill should fit well in that regard.  This is something about which the trade union movement has been making a lot of noise — and rightly so — over the years.The Bill provides that employment agencies established in other EU states must apply for an employment agency licence unless the Minister is satisfied that agencies in that state are permitted to operate only in accordance with a licence or are otherwise appropriately regulated or authorised in that state.  I ask the Minister of State if this means that outside agencies must apply for a permit here in order to operate in this country.  I assume many of those employment agencies are based outside of Ireland.  I was not aware there are 300 or 400 of them but I assume in a country of our size this would be appropriate enough.  I ask how these agencies will interface with this legislation when enacted.The Bill will establish a code of practice setting out practices and standards to provide practical guidance to queries for the purposes of complying with the Act.  I am not an expert on this type of law but is it the case there is no statutory obligation on people to accept the code of practice?  Is the Minister of State of the view that the employment agencies, when it suits them, might not be too concerned about the code of practice or does he believe it will become a marketing tool for them, that people will only deal with agencies which accept the code of practice and adhere to it?  The Minister of State is nodding in agreement.  I assume he has a good reason to believe this is what will happen.

The Bill provides for a capacity to revoke the licence of employment agencies and to prohibit recognised employment agencies from operating in Ireland for stated reasons.  I understand this is where the three-year rule applies.  I assume there is no possible side-step available.  I assume agencies are not single individuals but rather are companies under the Companies Act.  In a case where a group finds itself on the wrong side of the law and is duly struck off the register, can the Minister of State assure us, as far as is possible, that it cannot reappear under a different name, in a different place and at a different time?  Will he indicate how that might be policed?  We have not been particularly successful so far as company legislation is concerned, and this type of racket has been going on for years.  It has happened in the past when companies have been struck off that the directors proceed to set up a new operation in the name of their spouses, children or cousins.  In other words, it is the same company by another name.  How does the Minister of State intend to prevent that happening?We all understand the importance of including a provision to protect whistleblowers.  I have noticed in general, whether in the area of health, employment law or otherwise, that the whistleblower's lot is a lonely one.  Some of the greatest atrocities committed in this State were uncovered by those brave enough to blow the whistle.  However, the ultimate outcome for the whistleblowers themselves has not always been good, with some losing their jobs and those who do not often treated as pariahs who might as well have been out in the desert.  We must show that we are serious about protecting whistleblowers and that we will do everything possible to do so.  Such people are generally patriotic and entirely committed to acting in accordance with what they see as right.  It has been shown in many cases that they were absolutely right, but it often did not work out well for them and their families.  I hope the checks and balances the Minister of State provides will be in favour of the whistleblower.Deputy Varadkar spoke about the issue of compatibility within the European Single Market.  Under section 12 of the Bill, the Minister has the power to designate an EEA state as one which satisfies requirements for the licensing of employment agencies in that state.  Given that we are told every day of the week that the State is breaking some European Union law or other, I am interested to know what the view is in Brussels in regard to this provision.  How can Ireland decide that certain countries within the EEA are in and others out?  On what basis are those decisions made?  How will such a system work in the context of our linking up to the totality of the European Union and all its institutions?The Bill also provides for the establishment of an advisory committee to draw up a code of practice and advise the Minister on the implementation of the legislation.  This is a reasonable proposal, as is the provision that the committee should include the various stakeholders.  It is important that the latter should be included in the mix, but there is also a case for seeking the input of those who are not directly connected to the industry and the sector.  Will the Minister of State outline the proposed membership of the advisory committee?  I understand it will be a type of FÁS board, with all the stakeholders represented.  This may not ultimately be the best policy.If I understood correctly, the Minister of State indicated to one of my colleagues that training would have to be paid for by the user of the service.  Is that correct?

I assume there is nothing in these measures to prevent or prohibit agencies from training staff, which would go entirely against their principles and function.  If an employer is finding it difficult to recruit a certain type of employee with particular skills — this may have been more of a problem two or three years ago than it is now — that is the only concern; the employer could not care less who trains the employees so long as they come.  I assume that so long as the client pays for training, there is no hindrance in this regard.Is it the case that training for particular roles will come within training norms in this State?  In other words, in the case of electricians, for example, I assume the employment agency would have to use the relevant training agencies.  Is that correct?  If so, there must be a tie-up between the employment agencies and the training agencies.  While the Bill may look simple, it is not as straightforward as one might assume.  While there are issues to be teased out on Committee and Report Stages, Fine Gael is broadly supportive of the legislation.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The Ombudsman has submitted a special report, dealing with the lost at sea scheme, to the Dáil and Seanad in accordance with sections 6(5) and 6(7) of the Ombudsman Act 1980.  The 1980 Act does not set out a procedure to be adopted by the Oireachtas in dealing with this matter.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to make this statement to the House to set out my position on this matter.As I stated last week, I hold the Ombudsman, her office and the work it does in the highest esteem.  The investigation carried out by the Ombudsman and her team into this case has been forensic and painstaking and I compliment them on the time and effort put into compiling the report.  I take this opportunity to offer my sympathy to the family in question and the very many families bereaved in this way, including some among the other applicants under the scheme.  Many of these families have suffered sad loss and found themselves in difficult situations.  This is an unfortunate reality of the fishing industry although, thankfully, the improvements in the quality of fishing vessels and the better safety equipment on board have improved the situation over time.The lost at sea scheme run in 2001 was initiated by the then Department of Marine and Natural Resources, with responsibility subsequently moving to the then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in 2002.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food assumed responsibility for sea fisheries matters in October 2007.  For the information of the House, I propose to set out a brief outline of the scheme, the context in which it was promulgated and the outcomes of the applications received.  I will then explain why the Department does not agree with the Ombudsman's findings and her recommendation that monetary compensation be paid in this case.The lost at sea scheme was a limited scheme introduced in June 2001, with a closing date of 31 December 2001.  The objective of the scheme was to enable qualifying applicants, who were otherwise unable to do so for financial or related reasons, to continue a family tradition of sea fishing.  It was targeted at people who had been fishing and wanted to continue to do so.  It was a bounded and time-limited scheme under which replacement capacity — gross tonnes and kilowatts — that would otherwise have had to be bought on the tonnage market was provided free of charge to qualifying applicants.  The eligible applicants were those who lost a fishing vessel between 1980 and the establishment of the fishing boat register in 1990, but were unable to replace the fishing vessel for verified financial reasons.  The scheme was intended to assist families to introduce a replacement for the lost vessel that would be owned and skippered by the applicant or an immediate relation of the applicant.  The objective of the scheme was to allow fishermen or their immediate family members to get back fishing, rather than to award monetary benefit.  It was expressly not introduced as a means for a person who tragically lost a family member at sea to obtain payment from the State for this loss.The terms of the scheme specified further conditions relating to the use of the capacity after the applicant had been deemed eligible.  The term "capacity" is used to describe the volume of a fishing vessel, in gross tonnes, and the power of the vessel, in kilowatts.  Under EU Regulation 1438/2003, the total capacity of the Irish fishing fleet is limited to 88.7 gross tonnes and 244,834 kilowatts.  When the new sea fishing boat register was introduced in 1990, all vessels registered at the time were, in effect, awarded the capacity of their vessels free of charge.  Any vessel that had previously sunk or had otherwise been destroyed could not be registered.  Any such owner looking to return to fishing would have had to buy a replacement vessel and the necessary capacity in order to do so.  Capacity had become a valuable commodity over time because the overall capacity of the Irish fleet had been capped under the EU fleet management rules I have mentioned.  While the Department had no role in the tonnage market that had developed, there were indications that capacity was changing hands for up to £4,000 per gross tonne when the scheme was introduced.Records in the Department that were made available to the Ombudsman show that as far back as March 1999, there were contacts, meetings and correspondence on this issue between interested parties, including public representatives, individual vessel owners, fishermen's representatives and producer organisations.  It was argued that in a number of cases, the cost of purchasing replacement capacity was a factor in preventing families from getting back into fishing after losing a vessel.  The records show there was support for and opposition to such a scheme from within the industry.  Officials from the then Department of Marine and Natural Resources advised on the merits or otherwise of such a scheme and its conditions.  Opinion was divided within the industry.  Some parties felt it would be unfair to award free tonnage, in effect, to some people while others had to pay a high price on the tonnage market.  Some other parties supported the proposed scheme.  From an administrative perspective, it was important to ensure that any scheme could be strictly limited to those who met its criteria.  When the decision to establish a scheme was made, the terms and conditions that emerged from the process of consultation necessarily reflected the views of all stakeholders, the public policy considerations and the EU and national legal requirements of the time.The conditions of the scheme, as published, were submitted in full to the House last week in response to a parliamentary question.  Two of the conditions are of importance in this context.  The first of them states that the boat in question must be "shown, by reference to log sheet returns or other appropriate records, to have been in active and continuous use for a considerable period of years by the person concerned for sea fishing of a category now covered by the replacement policy rules, until its loss at sea".  The second condition states that "applications under the scheme must be received by 31 December 2001".  The various conditions, including those outlined last week, were rightly non-discretionary, objective and quite stringent.  They were intended to ensure that only those who met the criteria in full were successful, only the immediate family could benefit from any capacity awarded, the benefit of capacity for the scheme was to allow the family to return to fishing, and the capacity awarded could not be sold or turned into a monetary amount.  The scheme was launched in June 2001 with a closing date of 31 December 2001.  At that time, the Department had knowledge of 16 cases in which fishing vessels were lost at sea during the relevant period.  The owners of those vessels received written notifications of the new scheme and were invited to apply.  Two such cases were ultimately successful.  The scheme was intended for those who had been involved in the fishing industry and wanted to continue a family tradition of fishing, where the grant of capacity would enable the applicant or an immediate relation to return to fishing.  The advertising was quite successful and the scheme, despite its tight restrictions, received a good response.  There were 68 applications by the closing date, of which six were successful in meeting all of the conditions of the scheme and were awarded replacement capacity.The scheme was aimed at people and families who had a tradition in fishing, had been actively fishing and wanted to return to fishing through the scheme.  In light of the objective of the scheme, it was advertised widely in the major fishing trade papers in Ireland — the Marine Times, The Irish Skipper and Fishing News.  The various fishing representative groups, including all the producer organisations, were asked to assist in the publicising of the scheme.  A number of the 62 unsuccessful applications failed to meet more than one of the qualifying conditions.  I emphasise that the scheme did not provide for the purchase of a replacement fishing vessel.  The capacity given under the strict terms of the scheme could not be sold or otherwise traded or realised as a financial asset in the tonnage market.  The scheme was launched in June 2001, ran for six months and closed on 31 December 2001.  The complaint that is the subject of the Ombudsman’s special report was made by an additional applicant whose application under the lost at sea scheme was received in January 2003, over a year after the closing date.  As the application by the family in question for replacement tonnage under the scheme was received on 7 January 2003, it was refused on the basis of being received over a year after the closing date of 31 December 2001.  In addition, the lost vessel was not in active continuous service prior to its loss — for the purpose of the administration of the scheme, this was deemed to be a minimum of two years.  In November 2004, the son of the owner who had been lost with the vessel complained to the Ombudsman that the decision to refuse his family’s application was unfair on a number of grounds, principally that the family had not been made aware that the scheme existed and that its circumstances were such that it should have qualified under the scheme in the first instance.After extensive examination and correspondence between the various parties,  the Ombudsman found for the complainant in her first draft report and decided to award substantial monetary compensation to the family.  The Ombudsman concluded that the family did not meet at least two of the conditions of the scheme and that it had been adversely affected by the failure of its application.  The Ombudsman found that the advertising of the scheme was not adequate and was a factor in the lateness of the application from the Byrne family.  The Department believed that in view of the close-knit nature of the fishing community, it was appropriate in the circumstances to place an advertisement in the three major fishing publications in Ireland, to notify the fishermen's representative organisations and to write to those involved in 16 known individual cases.  The scheme was targeted at people who wanted to continue a family tradition of fishing themselves, or through an immediate relative, if successful under the scheme.  There is no certainty that an advertisement in the national newspapers, which would have been much less targeted than publicity in the fishing communities, would have been a better way of reaching the target audience.  I consider that there was not then, and there is not now, any way to be absolutely certain that every individual citizen is personally notified about every possible scheme.  The scheme was aimed at people with a family tradition in fishing who had been active in fishing and who expressly wanted to return to it.  Therefore, targeted advertising and communication channels, most commonly used by the fishing industry and fishing communities, were the most appropriate way to publicise the scheme.Like the officials in the Department, I have consistently taken the view that this scheme was properly and fairly administered by the then Department of Marine and Natural Resources, which was responsible for it at the time.  The Ombudsman has indeed expressly acknowledged that she found no evidence to suggest that, once the scheme was launched, it was not applied equitably.  In coming to my view on the Ombudsman's report, I considered all relevant aspects and implications of the case.  As a matter of course, I took legal advice, which was considered and acted upon.  I continue to hold the view that in this case, there is no basis for payment in the amount proposed or any amount.  In the first instance, the lost at sea scheme did not envisage any monetary awards.  The capacity awarded to the successful applicants could not be traded, sold or otherwise disposed of for financial gain.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	252	On the contrary, successful applicants had to provide a replacement vessel from their own resources, and pay for its running costs, to be able to make use of the capacity awarded.  In the case of the family in question, no replacement vessel had been purchased and no immediate family member had continued in fishing in the 20-year period between the accident and the inception of the scheme.  Given that the scheme was intended to allow families to continue a family tradition of sea fishing, it is difficult to see how it can be sustained that the family was disadvantaged by the failure of an application made 20 years later.  The family, perhaps understandably, left the fishing industry for the subsequent 20 years after the sinking.  In the exchange of correspondence, the Ombudsman contends that the substantial insurance pay-out received by the family was not relevant to her investigation or to the scheme.  The compensation figure of €245,570 that was recommended by the Ombudsman was arrived at by means of the methodology and rates used in the 2008 decommissioning scheme.  This completely separate and unrelated scheme involved being paid to voluntarily give up a working active vessel and its capacity, to pay to have it dismantled and to lose the future stream of income from it.  In her special report, the Ombudsman outlines the basis on which she believes the amount recommended is reasonable.At the Ombudsman's request the Department provided calculations on the basis of those rates and the tonnage of the lost vessel on the understanding that this was a starting point in her consideration of an appropriate amount of compensation.  The Ombudsman cites the average payments to the successful applicants under that scheme as being comparable.  I do not believe that the situations are in any way comparable.  In the case of the decommissioning scheme, the vessel owners had the expense of purchasing and maintaining a vessel.  The rates payable under that scheme were intended to incentivise and compensate those owners to voluntarily decommission their vessels entirely and forego the income they would get into the future were they to continue to operate them.  The Ombudsman is mistaken in her belief, as cited in her letter of 5 June 2009, that successful applicants under the decommissioning scheme had the option of selling on their vessel as the decommissioned vessel had to be scrapped at the owner's expense and the tonnage could not be sold on or otherwise transferred.  I reiterate that I am of the view that payment in the case investigated is not warranted in the amount specified or any amount in this case.The Department remains concerned that the recommendation regarding this specific case would give rise to major financial liabilities arising from claims from others who were unsuccessful applicants under the scheme.  The report asserts that the recommendation relates to this case only, that the analysis, conclusions and findings flow from the particular circumstances of that case alone and that it has no implications for other unsuccessful applicants.  Following full consideration and on foot of legal advice, I do not accept that this assertion is consistent or logical.The Ombudsman's finding was that the design of the scheme itself and the manner in which it was advertised were "contrary to fair and sound administration" and that the Byrne family had been treated unfairly as a consequence.  I do not accept this.  The scheme as applied to the Byrne family was the same scheme as that applied, equitably, as the Ombudsman has acknowledged, to all the other applications received.  The considered legal advice given to the Minister contends that it is inevitable that the Ombudsman's recommendation regarding monetary payment may result in other unsuccessful applicants to this scheme seeking the same consideration and the material circulated by the Ombudsman yesterday confirms the view that this is the case.I am not convinced that unsuccessful applicants would not pursue cases, were the recommendation to be accepted.  Furthermore, some of the successful applicants for the scheme, who could not take up the capacity awarded because of the strict conditions, might seek to use the precedent created by any change in the conditions of the scheme, which would happen were the Ombudsman's recommendations acceded to.  In addition, those who contacted the Department in the year after the scheme had closed or who might have applied in that period also would seek to build a case on the basis of the Ombudsman's recommendation.While it is impossible at present to estimate precisely the financial outlay or potential liability that might be involved, there is no doubt that it is likely to be substantial and to have a serious financial impact.  There are also, perhaps more importantly, implications for the operation of other administrative schemes across Government that have application deadlines.  Members are familiar with schemes that operate to strict deadlines that are enforced and affect people's daily lives directly.  Deadlines are a fundamental feature of most schemes and are strictly enforced and adhered to generally in accepting or rejecting applications under schemes.  Totally discounting the deadline in this scheme and accepting the validity of an application that was more than a year late, as the Ombudsman suggests, could have very wide and probably incalculable financial and other implications for public administration in Ireland.Since the conclusion of the Ombudsman's investigation in November 2008, the Department has been engaged in correspondence with the Ombudsman with regard to her findings in this case and her proposal to award financial compensation.  In summary, I reiterate that the complainants did not apply for the scheme within the timeframe and were more than a year late in applying.  The family did not meet some of the criteria of the scheme.  The Department maintains its position that the scheme was scrupulously fairly administered, in that each applicant was treated fairly under the scheme within specific terms, rules and conditions.  The Ombudsman acknowledges that there is no evidence that the scheme was not applied equitably.  The scheme was advertised in a targeted way to the target audience, that is, those with a family tradition of fishing and who would return to fishing if successful under the scheme.  Accordingly, there is no basis for the award of payment in this case.As I stated at the outset and now wish to reiterate, I have the highest regard for the Ombudsman, for the Office of Ombudsman and for the Ombudsman's team.  The issue investigated and reported on by the Ombudsman is a very difficult one and has taken much time and effort on the part of both the Ombudsman's office and the Department.  I have taken on board the points raised by the Ombudsman regarding the design of the lost at sea scheme and I assure Members that relevant points will be taken into account in the design of any future schemes in this Department.

Francis and Jimmy Byrne and three crew members, namely, Tony O'Brien, James Lafferty and Des McGovern lost their lives in a tragic accident when the MFV Skifjord  sank.  During this debate Members should acknowledge what a great loss and personal tragedy this event was for the Byrne family and the families of the other crewmen, as well as the difficult position in which it left the Byrne family, whereby Mrs. Byrne was left on her own with eight young children to be reared.This morning in this House, while defending the manner in which this debate is taking place, the Tánaiste falsely put on the record the suggestion that Members on this side of the House had sought the kind of debate that is taking place.  She stated they did not request a committee hearing subsequent to a Dáil debate.  For this reason, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I wish to draw Members' attention to the Official Report, 15 December 2009, vol. 698, p. 429, when Deputy Kenny stated: "I respectfully suggest to the Taoiseach that, at an appropriate time in the new year, the Whips might agree that there be a discussion on the loss at sea scheme report here in the Dáil and that it be referred to a committee for deeper analysis and consideration".  In the Official Report, 17 December 2009, vol. 698, p. 1012, I asked, "will the Taoiseach introduce a proposal to debate the issue in the House early in the new year and to refer the matter onwards to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for further investigation?"The debate in which Members are involved this afternoon is a sham.  It constitutes a further erosion of the role the democratic assembly of the people should play in the nation's affairs.  It is a meaningless debate which lacks a substantial motion and which does not do justice to the report which has been compiled painstakingly over a long time by the Office of the Ombudsman.  I expect two things.  First, I expect the Tánaiste to come before the House and acknowledge that she misled the House.  I would accept her bona fides that she did not do so deliberately.  In addition, I also expect that the Tánaiste and the Government will now enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to proceed to a forensic analysis in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the detail of this report.It is abundantly clear, from the raced manner in which the Minister of State delivered a long and detailed script, that there is no possibility of having the kind of scrutiny that is necessary.  Highly serious issues are at stake and I welcome Deputy Fahey to the debate because at all stages, he has been anxious to defend his integrity on this issue.  This parliamentary forum should be about a meaningful engagement with the former Minister, senior officials within the Department, the applicant at the centre of the complaint and the Office of the Ombudsman.  Thereafter, the cards should be allowed to fall where they might and Members should be allowed to draw their parliamentary conclusions.  However, what is being attempted in this debate is a circling of the wagons within Fianna Fáil and the Government.  In this regard, I regret to note the absence from the Chamber of Members of the Green Party.  That party made a complaint to the Standards in Public Office Commission about Deputy Fahey across a range of issues from the lost at sea scheme to others which have nothing to do with this report and on which I do not propose to dwell.  Consequently, the Green Party is giving the Government carte blanche to deal with this matter in a manner that can only be described as akin to sweeping it under the carpet.I assure the Minister of State that Fine Gael will use every parliamentary tactic available to it to ensure that the Office of the Ombudsman is not undermined in a shoddy manner.  It is abundantly clear that the Office of the Ombudsman is anathema to Fianna Fáil, in the same way as the freedom of information legislation.  There have been recent examples of attempts by Fianna Fáil to emasculate the operation of the freedom of information legislation because it shines a light where that party would prefer darkness to prevail to enable its members to engage in stroke politics behind closed doors.  This debate is an exercise in circling the wagons, in attempting to avoid a thorough and detailed investigation and to prevent the truth from coming out.It is worth reading into the Official Report the purpose of the Office of the Ombudsman, which states:Our purpose is to help raise public service standards.  Individuals, businesses or organisations who feel they have been unfairly treated can make complaints to the Ombudsman.  Our service is free.  We aim to ensure that people are treated with dignity, respect and sensitivity in their dealings with the public service.  We will make every effort to deal with your complaint properly, fairly and impartially.The office has done itself some justice in the manner in which it has dealt with this complaint.  It also is important to acknowledge that by the end of 2008, approximately 72,000 valid complaints had been handled by the Office of the Ombudsman.On only two previous occasions has this House been tasked with considering a report and playing a role in assisting a resolution of an intractable problem under the terms of the legislation establishing the Office of the Ombudsman whereby it has failed to resolve an issue in engagement — and intensive engagement there has been — with various Departments or agencies covered by it.  On one of those occasions the Revenue Commissioners were involved.  It is important to acknowledge that even in that case the recommendation in respect of the individuals involved was that a payment of €600,000 was appropriate.  Although the case was initially referred to the Ombudsman by the Revenue Commissioners, they have not complied with the letter of the findings.  What we are seeing over a period of time is an attempt to undermine the efficiency, effectiveness and public confidence that the Office of the Ombudsman enjoys.God knows ordinary citizens will wait a long time before the front gates of Government Buildings are open for them to have access to make complaints to the Government when they feel they have been treated poorly in their engagements with public services.  Bankers and developers all have access under the cover of darkness and in broad daylight to Government Buildings.  On many occasions they walk out with billions of taxpayers' money for their rescue.  The only recourse that John or Joan Citizen have when they feel aggrieved is the Office of the Ombudsman.  Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are circling the wagons to quash the findings of the Ombudsman's report.  Treading on little people is disgraceful and will do untold damage to the Office of the Ombudsman.The precedent established in how the House dealt with the issue of the report on the Revenue Commissioners is also interesting.  It was dealt with under scrutiny and cross-examination by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which made two telling conclusions.  These were that the findings in the case should be honoured and that all future findings in Ombudsman's reports should equally be honoured.  Both of these findings are being thrown to the wind because we have not yet fully complied with the original case by the Revenue Commissioners and we are again thumbing our nose at the Office of the Ombudsman.  That is not good enough and begs the most fundamental questions as to why.The report into the complaint is most interesting.  The Minister of State laboured the point that this was never about financial compensation.  I acknowledge that originally the scheme itself was not about financial compensation.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Deputy Fahey will have his day and I wish he would volunteer to come before a committee.  I have never stated the original scheme was about financial compensation but the issue is about financial compensation now because to the complainant there is no tonnage on offer.  The resolution to this difficulty as promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman is based on the decommissioning scheme and proposes a payment in the region of €245,000.  The honourable thing for the Government to do would be to abide by the findings.It is abundantly clear that there are fault lines in the records of the Department which clearly delineate where Deputy Fahey stood on this issue in respect of ring-fencing, a term used by Deputy Fahey, and the views of officials.  At this stage, it is not for this House to get into the merits or demerits of the lost at sea scheme per se.  What we must do is deal with the findings and learn from them.  Appendix 3 is one of the most interesting appendices of the report.  It states:Concessions of any kind on the "sunken boats" issue would have the following negative impacts:—(a) to increase further effort on Irish sea stocks would run contrary to policy objectives [. . .](b) additional fishing capacity will undermine the livelihood of existing fishermen.(c) these cases have been around for 15/20 years and have not been entertained by successive Ministers. [. . .]The most interesting points it states are:(d) acceptance of these boats as replacement capacity amounts in effect to the writing of a gratuitous cheque for £500,000 [...] to be allocated to a number of individuals and with a negative return to the State and the economy.(e) as the State/taxpayer will inevitably have to buy out equivalent fleet capacity, the gain of £500,000 to a number of individuals will have in effect to be financed by the general taxpayer.We know the outcome of the scheme was that it did benefit a number of individuals, two of whom received 75% of the compensation available and happened to be constituents of the former Minister, Deputy Fahey.  The issue is not so much about whether a scheme should have been proceeded.  It is most accurately summed up in correspondence released under the Freedom of Information Act.  This is a letter dated 19 February 2001 which was sent by Mark Lochrin of the Irish Fish Producers' Organisation to the then Minister, Deputy Fahey.  It states:  "The view of this Organisation is that you should proceed with the proposed concessions.  Our only question: Is Justice to be ring-fenced?".  This goes to the kernel of what is at stake.When he was Minister, Deputy Fahey took the initiative of communicating with a handful.  The Department took the initiative of corresponding with upwards of 16 people.  Where the charge of maladministration stands up is that the Department had access to all of the records on boats that were sunk.  Initially a tentative inquiry was made to establish this information and the Ombudsman's report contains correspondence to the effect that it would be an enormous job of work to collate all of the information in a manner that was discernible for the purposes of the scheme and it was not done.The question of whether justice is to be ring-fenced is what is at stake.  The words "a handful of genuine cases" echo again and again through the correspondence in the Ombudsman's report.  We know it was ring-fenced.  We know from the Ombudsman's report that it was unfairly ring-fenced.The Ombudsman's report is damning in its findings on the advertising of the scheme.  Is it reasonable to expect a widow-woman who lost her husband and son to be a regular reader of fishing publications?  Is it not reasonable to expect that she would have been corresponded with about the terms of the scheme?  The Department had those records available to it.  These are the critical questions on which the former Minister, Deputy Fahey, has repeatedly muddied the waters and for which there are no clear answers.I have read correspondence from the Secretary General and the former Secretary General at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which had responsibility for the marine, in which they state that the floodgates would open; that justice would be delivered to ordinary people and that floodgates would open.  Justice is never at too high a price and the floodgates argument does not stand up anyway because in the cases brought to the Ombudsman's attention, which I believe amounted to nine or ten, the Ombudsman found in favour of only one.  The fear that it would cost the State an arm and a leg does not stand up.We have to step out of the straightjackets that are restricting our vision on this matter.  We have to deliver justice whatever it might cost.  I do not believe this would cost a fortune and to do otherwise than to forensically analyse the matter by bringing all of the players before an Oireachtas committee would seriously undermine public confidence in the Ombudsman's office.  I repeat my opening remarks, which I am sure the Minister of State will convey to his colleagues, that this side of the House will use every parliamentary tactic available to it to ensure this matter is referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.Today, I have requested the Chairman of that committee to have the matter considered.  I hope Deputy Fahey will volunteer to appear before the committee rather than be dragged there kicking and screaming.  Let us have the full and open discussion we require.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13574	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I do not want to begin with a litany of platitudes or patronising comments but we must recognise the suffering and hardship endured by the Byrne family.  We must also have regard for the loss of three crewmen and the father and uncle of Mr. Danny Byrne, the complainant.  It is important that we keep the Byrne family to the forefront of our minds when speak on this matter.  However, the manner in which the Minister of State sought to question the family's motivation is utterly degrading.  In his contribution to the debate, he stated:In the case of the family in question, no replacement vessel had been purchased and no immediate family member had continued in fishing in the 20-year period between the accident and the inception of the scheme. Given that the scheme was intended to allow families to continue a family tradition of sea fishing, it is difficult to see how it can be sustained that the family was disadvantaged by the failure of their application some 20 years later. Indeed after the sinking the family were seen, perhaps understandably, to have left the fishing industry for the subsequent 20 years.The Minister of State has no right to adjudicate on the motives of that family nor to introduce spin and revisionist views on this historical case.  I have also seen correspondence from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which sought to undermine the role of the family.  Nobody in this Chamber knows exactly what the Byrnes were going through but today we are debating the maladministration of a scheme and the Ombudsman's role in investigating it.  In the preamble to her report on the Byrne case, the Ombudsman states: "I found that the design of the Scheme and the manner in which it was advertised were contrary to fair and sound administration."  Let there be no attempt by anybody on the Government side of the House to undermine the family or the historical record.The matter at hand is one of natural justice and whether the Byrne family received due recognition for its complaint or an appropriate response from the agencies of the State.  As an Opposition Deputy, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Trevor Sargent, filed a complaint over the role of the former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Frank Fahey, in this affair with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  While SIPO rejected the complaint, the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent's action demonstrates that certain Members who are now in Government recognised the maladministration inherent in the scheme.  The Ombudsman found the scheme to be "seriously deficient and flawed" and the European Commission was never informed of the scheme's existence.The Byrne family has been treated abysmally by the agents of the State, with the notable exception of the Office of the Ombudsman.  There can be no doubt that the Ombudsman dealt with the complaint in a manner that was conducive to the powers vested in her office.  However, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food clearly has decided to ensure that the family will not gain redress.  As a Legislature, we are left for only the second time in the history of this State with a scenario that has completely undermined the role of the Office of the Ombudsman.By its decision to reject the Ombudsman's findings, the Government has undermined the confidence of citizens that they can successfully resolve their complaints and severely compromised the independent statutory role vested in that office by this Legislature.  For the Labour Party, this is a case of ensuring that the organs of the State are not undermined or demeaned in any way.  We must not neglect the significance of a rejection by the Government of the Ombudsman's report.  That the report has been laid before the Houses, presumably as a last resort, speaks volumes about the contempt this Government holds for any independent arbiter whose role is laid out under statute.What hope can the ordinary citizen have that a complaint will be adjudicated upon fairly if a decision can be rejected by the Government of the day for reasons of political expediency?  The Byrne family has been subjected to the ignominy of seeing a report which offers redress and a measure of natural justice rejected for the sake of that same political expediency.  I have studied the correspondence between the Department and the Ombudsman's office.  It is clear even to a layman that the Department is engaged in a parsimonious exercise and will do anything to abdicate its responsibilities.  The Minister of State's lengthy speech clearly demonstrates that attitude.  The essence of his argument, namely, that he rejected the findings of the report out of hand, could have been expressed in ten seconds.I seek justice for the Byrne family and an acknowledgement of the Ombudsman's report.  It is insufficient to make statements on this issue.  If this House is to conduct its business properly, we must refer the report to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It is critical that we afford the Ombudsman an opportunity to present her findings to that committee.  We must also be able to hear from all interested parties in order to understand the issue fully.The Ombudsman stated:My role as Ombudsman is to ensure that our public administration system deals properly and fairly with members of the public and this is a task which I am committed to fulfilling, without fear or favour, in line with the statutory authority which has been granted to my Office by the Oireachtas.My decision to make a special report in this case was not taken lightly.  It is my statutory duty under the Ombudsman Act, 1980 to decide what is fair and reasonable in relation to each complaint that comes before me.  Where a remedy is warranted I take great care to ensure that my recommendations are both appropriate and proportionate.  The credibility of any Ombudsman depends on his or her ability to deliver adequate and appropriate remedies to people who have been treated unfairly.  My investigation of the Byrne family's complaint has been painstaking and forensic.  However, in this case, despite my best efforts, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food continues to dispute my findings and recommendations and I have been unable to resolve the impasse.  My only option when this arises is to seek the intervention of the Oireachtas. It now has the task of deciding who is right and who is wrong in the context of good administration and fairness to the complainant.We in the Labour Party propose that the House would adhere to the recommendations of the Ombudsman.  I accept it is not within our gift in the context of this debate to apply her findings and deliver some degree of natural justice to the family.  Accordingly, I propose that we facilitate the Ombudsman at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, so that she and her office may be afforded an opportunity to outline further her findings and to enable the members of this House to come to a satisfactory conclusion on the matter.It is vital that no one, be it an official of the Department, or a Minister or Minister of State, has the right or entitlement to subjectively question the motives of the family as to whether they would continue to fish, whether they should have read certain industry newspapers to search for advertisements, or whether that was taken as a given, because as the Minister in effect said, it was a small community and they should have known that the scheme was available.  It is not for the Minister to decide on the motivations of the family or to comment on them in 2010 in the context of a scheme that was in place from 1980 or 1981 to 1989.What is at stake is the role of the Ombudsman and the decision and findings of that office.  The Ombudsman clearly stated that there was maladministration and that the scheme was not properly advertised.  She made a decision to grant redress for the reasons outlined in the report.  The issue is whether the Government decides to take on board the views of an independent arbiter, which has a statutory function.  We are plunging ourselves into dangerous territory if we decide for the second time to reject a report of the Ombudsman.This is the tribune of the people but decisions taken by the tribune of the people have to be subjected to an independent arbiter.  We are in dangerous territory if we go the route of rejecting an Ombudsman's report.  We all have to be subject to scrutiny on decisions by branches of the State.  That is why I feel strongly that the Ombudsman must be brought before the committee so that we have another opportunity to explore further this decision.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	257	As the two previous speakers indicated, we are talking about a tragic event where two of the Byrne family and three of their crew lost their lives.  We must not lose sight of that tragedy and other tragedies that occur at sea.  Our deepest sympathy goes to the families of all victims.The fact that the Ombudsman has felt that she needed to submit this report to the Oireachtas is sufficient proof that her description of the lost at sea scheme as "seriously deficient and flawed" is warranted and that the Byrne family was treated unfairly in regard to their claim for compensation following the loss of two members of the Byrne family and three crewmen when their boat the Skifjord sank in 1981.The Byrne family only applied to the scheme a year after applications had closed, but they argued that the scheme, which had been advertised in the fishing press, should have been publicised more widely.  Another problem arose because, despite the tragic nature of the incident and the fact that it was widely reported, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources claimed to have no record of it.  That was apparently why the Byrne family was not notified of the scheme being established.  I cannot comprehend how a Department was not aware that five people drowned or that a boat was lost with such tragic circumstances.  I do not think anyone believes that.  Is the Department telling us that it has no list of boats lost at sea or knowledge of the tragedies that occurred as a result of some of those losses?  I do not believe that.  I do not say that lightly.  I do not believe one word of it.  Is it credible that five people were lost yet there is no record of it?On the question of the advertising of the scheme, how in the name of God can one assume that people who have left the industry as a result of having lost their vessels would automatically read the fishing press every month?  There is no basis for that assumption.  In many cases, when people leave the industry they do not have recourse to the fishing press.  The Ombudsman agreed with the Byrne family in its complaints on all of those issues and also concluded that because of the way in which the scheme was designed, that it was applied inequitably.  On that basis she recommended that the Byrne family be compensated and a figure of just under €250,000 was calculated as the amount of compensation.  However, that was rejected by the Department even though it was officials within the Department who had arrived at that compensation figure.The scheme itself, while it did provide compensation for the successful applicants reflects much of what is wrong with the manner in which fishing is managed or rather mismanaged in this State.  It was only necessary in the first instance in order that people who had lost their boats could access replacement tonnage despite the restrictions placed on the size of the fleet by the new system of regulation that came into place in 1990.  When the scheme was proposed there was a view within the Department that it might facilitate certain people to access quota while others would be forced to pay for it or would be unable to get any.  The then Minister, Deputy Fahey, overruled those objections.  The manner in which the scheme operated only heightened that concern.Apart from the failure to advertise more widely, the Ombudsman found that some of those who applied were in fact contacted in writing in order to inform them of the existence of the lost at sea scheme.  Who took the decision to write to certain people but not others about the existence of the scheme?  We need to know the answer to that question.  Many of those who are aware of the situation would be prepared to say that it was due to political cronyism at its worst; to write to the people who support the party and to forget the rest.There is also the claim that two constituents of the Minister responsible, Deputy Fahey, had originally suggested the establishment of the scheme.  We need to know if this is true.  The two people in question received €2.1 million out of a total of €2.8 million available under the scheme.  It is also claimed the criteria were changed in order that one of the two people would qualify, despite being found not to meet the criteria laid down in the first place.  We need answers again on this.Of the 67 applicants between June 2001 and the closing of the scheme on December 31, only six were accepted.  A total of €2.8 million was paid out to the six successful applicants to buy replacement tonnage.  Two of the then Minister's constituents received 75% of the total funds.  It was later discovered that although the scheme did not close until December 31 2001, Deputy Fahey had written to his two constituents in October congratulating them on being successful prior to the closure of the scheme.  How can that be explained?  However, it was also found that one of those persons did not qualify but he appealed and his application was accepted in 2003 with one of the reasons cited for the award being the fact that the Minister's letter of congratulations had created the reasonable expectation that he would receive compensation.Is it any wonder that the political establishment in this State is viewed in coastal communities with such distaste?  Is it any wonder that officials in the Department with responsibility for the marine are looked upon in communities such as the one in I which live as people who are not with it and who are subject to allegations and perceptions of corruption when we see what is before us today?  I come from a coastal community and we have buried people who lost their lives at sea.  My neighbours and friends have worked in the most difficult circumstances to put food on the table and they see €2.1 million being given to constituents of the then Minister, despite one of them not meeting the qualifying criteria but subsequently being awarded a payment because the Minister congratulated him before he had received it.The Ombudsman's report on the Byrne family's application highlighted that it was being processed before the 2003 decision in the case I mentioned.  How can the former Minister explain that to the family and to Opposition and Government Members?  How could somebody who did not meet the qualifying criteria be compensated on appeal after the Byrne family's application had gone in?These issues were raised previously and referred to in a number of press reports.  They were also mentioned in this House by Deputy Sargent in June 2006 during an extensive survey of Deputy Fahey's property holdings.  Deputy Sargent specifically mentioned the fact that two of then Minister's constituents had received a large share of the compensation.  He went on to call on the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to sack Deputy Fahey, which I recall drew a somewhat blunt response from him who told him to "Put up or shut up".  The claim regarding the two individuals was contained in an article in Ireland on Sunday two weeks later, which stated that the two people concerned had suggested setting up the scheme in the first place and that the criteria governing applications were changed to facilitate one of those persons.Subsequently, Deputy Fahey made a complaint to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges about what had been said about him but he failed to secure the necessary support to censure Deputy Sargent who, in December 2006, made a complaint to the Standards in Public Office Commission specifically citing the lost at sea scheme as one of the reasons to investigate the then Minister, along with his involvement in the Corrib gas pipeline and the allocation of 14,000 tonnes in quota to the Atlantic Dawn.  This trawler, using a national asset, is currently fishing off the west coast under the name of a Dutch consortium.

I have been reliably informed about this and it is using a national asset, its tonnage, to procure Irish fish for a Dutch consortium.It is clear from the Ombudsman's report and all the other issues surrounding this scheme, including those to which I have referred, that a full investigation needs to be carried out into all aspects of the way in which the lost at sea scheme operated.  My colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, other Opposition spokespersons and I met Emily O'Reilly in her office yesterday.  She told us she did not take the decision to publish this report lightly.  Her job is to investigate issues of public concern involving the State and the very least she deserves when it is found there are questions to answer is that they be taken seriously.On the basis of the contribution of the Minister of State to this debate and the response of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the Order of Business earlier, I regret that the integrity of an independent body is being challenged by the Government in the House.  We need a full, thorough and, as Deputy Creed said, forensic investigation into everything in this report and we need to offer the opportunity to the Department, the former Minister and the current Minister to appear before the committee to explain the terrible wrong that has been done to the Byrne family, the way the scheme was prosecuted by the then Minister and the Department, the way the scheme differentiated between people in coastal communities and why certain people received letters and were invited to submit their applications while others were totally and absolutely ignored.  All the facts need to be established promptly.The Department's decision to rule on the Byrne family's application was wrong.  The reason the application was late was due to irresponsible advertising in fishing newspapers, which did not take into account that a family no longer involved in the industry might not become aware of the scheme.  It is unbelievable that the Department said it did not have knowledge about the sinking and loss of life on the boat.  The treatment of the Ombudsman by the Department and the Government in this tragic case was disgraceful and it has blatantly attempted to undermine the integrity of her office.  The perception in our communities about the workings of the Department and the cronyisn associated with certain people needs to brought out in the open and people need a through and clean explanation.Yesterday, I wrote to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food requesting that Emily O'Reilly and her team be invited to appear before it in order that we can conduct a forensic examination.  The other Opposition spokespersons have done the same.  This must be debated by a committee of the House and the people who did wrong in this case need to be brought to book.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	262	All of the allegations made by the Deputy from Kerry are totally and completely untrue.  I was appointed Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in January 2000, halfway through the Government's term of office.  I chose to run the Department in an entrepreneurial way and expand and pursue the developmental role of the Department in the marine sector.  My objective was to deliver an action plan to exploit the marine potential of this island nation.One common complaint in all ports I visited was that fishermen who did not have a fishing boat on the national register when capacity — that is, gross tonnage and engine power — became an asset in January 1990, because their boats had been lost at sea, were obliged to purchase the capacity they had lost in order to acquire a new boat to return to fishing.  That anomaly was put right in the 1990 regulations.  EU regulations were not breached by the issue of replacement tonnage in 2001, as has been falsely claimed, including by Deputies today.  A change in regulations did take place with the introduction of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, after I had left the Department.The issue was raised at meetings with various fishing organisations and individuals throughout the country, particularly in Killybegs, Ros a' Mhíl and Castletownbere.  Following the introduction of the new register in 1990, the new licensing policy stated that off-register capacity could be used to introduce a fishing boat onto the register within two years of deregulation; otherwise, the capacity would be lost to its owner.  Off-register capacity means capacity that is no longer in use because it was constructively lost, broken up, unseaworthy or no longer engaged in fishing.  In the lost at sea scheme, a six-month window was provided to enable people to apply for registration in the same way.  Thus, Deputy Ferris is totally wrong in the allegation he made in this regard.A major omission in the new fishing boat licensing regulations was that no provision was made for retrospective off-register boats.  I decided this was unfair and iniquitous, and after prolonged discussion and negotiation with Department officials, I decided to make a policy decision to introduce a limited scheme to grant replacement capacity — that is, gross tonnage and engine power — to fishermen who were still involved in fishing industry.  This is the crucial point that has been lost in this debate since it started six years ago.  This scheme was for fishermen who were involved in the fishing industry when the scheme was introduced in 2001.One of the issues brought to my attention by the scheme was that no formal marine accident investigation mechanism existed in the Department.  In June 2002, I established the Marine Casualty Investigation Board as an independent body.  The board was set up to provide a new legislative and procedural review to regulate the area of marine casualty investigation in Ireland.  A critical point in my policy decision, which was expressly written into the terms of reference of the scheme, was that it was to sustain or maintain a family tradition in the fishing industry.  This was to facilitate individuals and families who were still involved in the fishing industry when the scheme was introduced in 2001, and renders irrelevant many of the allegations that have been made here.  This is the reason the scheme was advertised only in the marine press and the fishing organisations were consulted and informed of the scheme.  The Byrne family had not been involved in fishing since the tragic accident in the early 1980s, so they would not have qualified for the scheme even if their application had been made in time.  Nothing I am saying should be taken as in any way detracting from the tragic circumstances giving rise to this complaint and the terrible loss suffered by the Byrne family, which I sincerely acknowledge.  I agree with all other speakers that this family suffered a terrible tragedy in 1982.Jim Higgins MEP contacted the Ombudsman on behalf of the Byrne family.  A complaint was made to the office in November 2004 but I was not contacted by the Office of the Ombudsman about this complaint until July 2007, six years after the scheme had been designed and implemented, four and a half years after the Byrne family application had been refused, and two and a half years after the Ombudsman had received the complaint.On 11 May 2005, an official in the Office of the Ombudsman wrote to the Byrne family expressing the view that the scheme may have been deficient and flawed.  The complaint was then only at the stage of preliminary investigation and no findings, even of a preliminary nature, had been made by the Ombudsman.  It was wholly inappropriate and premature for this official to so describe the scheme and to communicate this to the complainant at that time, without the completion of a full examination by the Ombudsman and the hearing of submissions from all parties, including myself.  This represented a prejudgment by an official in the Ombudsman's office of the complaint in the absence of a full and fair examination and investigation.It is clear from the critical letter from the Ombudsman, dated 10 February 2005, that there was a fundamental misunderstanding on the part of the official involved with regard to the scheme's application to people still engaged in the fishing industry.  I was not informed about the investigation and was not asked to explain my policy decision until July 2007.  At that stage, officials in the Office of the Ombudsman had made assumptions based on a misunderstanding of this policy decision.  I repeat, the lost at sea scheme was introduced in 2001 to allow people to maintain or sustain a family tradition in the fishing industry.Officials in the Office of the Ombudsman were not aware until they interviewed me in July 2007 that it was I who inserted the condition that capacity could not be sold or otherwise disposed of and that no financial gain should accrue to any applicant who was successful in the scheme.  I inserted that condition into the scheme, after the memo to which Deputy Creed referred about a gratuitous cheque for £500,000, because I wanted to ensure nobody would benefit financially from the scheme.

It is interesting to note that a number of the people who qualified for the scheme have lost money on it since then.The Ombudsman's report stated that the appropriate remedy for the adverse effects suffered by the Byrne family was monetary compensation and that the calculation methods set out in the 2008 decommissioning scheme, as applicable to others who were successful under the lost at sea scheme, should now be applied to the Byrne family.  I cannot accept the recommendation that the Byrne family — who did not qualify and should not have qualified for the scheme in the first place — should now be paid financial compensation.  This would be contrary to the most fundamental principles of the scheme.The conclusion of the Ombudsman's report states: "The Scheme did not provide financial support to successful applicants" — is the Deputy listening?

It could not be sold on or otherwise traded or realised as a financial asset in the tonnage market.The Ombudsman's report goes on to state, with reference to a letter to the Ombudsman dated 20 July 2009 from the head of the legal services division in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food:The letter of 30 July 2009 also suggested that, notwithstanding the tragic circumstances of the case, it did not provide a basis to transform a mechanism dealing with tonnage for fishing vessels into a system for compensation.  I fully accept that successful applicants were granted replacement tonnage under the Scheme, rather than compensation.That is on page 9 of the Ombudsman's report.

The other four successful applicants were left with the crumbs.  If ever a government sponsored scheme stank of political cronyism then this scheme surely is a fine example.We heard the same from Deputy Ferris today.  I ask him to withdraw his false allegation as soon as I am finished.  There was no funding in this scheme and there was no money paid out to my constituents or anybody else.

I have had to put up with the sort of complete misrepresentation that we have heard today about what was involved in this scheme.  There was no 75% of any compensation given to anybody.  The Ombudsman's report states on page 9 that she accepted gross tonnage was made available by way of replacement capacity and not compensation.  It is not correct to say any scheme was ring-fenced.  I was most anxious to ensure everyone had an opportunity.  It was not correct to say specific individuals were written to.  Anyone who had made representation to the Department in the years previous to the scheme, and there were many, were all contacted to tell them the scheme was being considered.I have had to put up with many of the allegations made today for six years.  They were mainly made by Jim Higgins MEP.  They are wrong and anyone who reads the report of the Ombudsman, particularly the quotations I cited from pages 3 and 9 of the report, will see they are wrong.  My good name has been vindicated by the Ombudsman against the false allegations made against me.

I only deal with facts and everything I am going to say can be substantiated.  Before I start, however, I would like to say the name "Stroke" Fahey is wasted on Deputy Fahey's colleague from County Galway.  Deputy Fahey is neither qualified nor able to come in here and criticise officials in the carrying out of their duties when one sees that Deputy Fahey showed no regard or respect for the officials in his own Department.  I am surprised at the absence of one of those officials today.  She has played a starring role in the whole debate.

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I just said I am disappointed the official is not here because she had a starring role in the whole debacle.I will start by quoting from correspondence from Mark Lochrin to the Minister.  It stated that the establishment of an appeals mechanism to cater for cases such as these had been an issue for years.  In this instance, according to the correspondence, the Minister was obviously convinced as to the reasonableness of their case by persons of influence and very rightly proposed to act.  Mr. Lochrin asked, however, why only for these. He argued the case for an appeals mechanism available to all, as pertained in most other sectors, was irrefutable.The documents I have show that the first mention of the scheme was in March 1999, when the Minister of State for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, attended a meeting with Mr. Tony Faherty and Mr. Paddy Mullen.  The two gentlemen were seeking credit for replacement capacity purposes — tonnage — for two vessels they owned that had sunk in November 1983.  Department officials advised them under policy rules this was not possible.  Deputy Ó Cuív indicated that reluctantly he accepted the Department's position.  He recognised the adverse precedent it would set.The next mention of the two men making representations to the Department is of the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, seeking a meeting with two officials to discuss the possibility of allowing replacement capacity, in particular, in the case of his constituents.  Under the Standards in Public Office Commission regulations, an office-holder should, inter alia, act only by reference to, and dedicate the resources of his office in furtherance of, the public interest and not be influenced in their official duties by personal considerations.  When Deputy Fahey said he wanted to see how he could ring-fence the six or eight genuine cases, one must ask how the then Minister could come to his conclusion about genuine cases when the 120 files were never studied by anyone in his Department or by him.  How could he reach that conclusion?There is a note from Joe Ryan, sea fisheries administration division, where he agrees that the circumstances surrounding the Mullen and Faherty claims are deserving of sympathy and help and that they have the benefit of being well documented and backed up.  One could say this is a coincidence.The note to the Minister continued, however, that the overriding problem is where this would stop.  It stated that in addition to the six that were known about, plus others involved in the High Court case, it could safely be assumed any number of individual cases would seek the same treatment and it would be advisable to discuss them prior to the Minister making a decision.  A handwritten note from the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, stated: "I want to see how we can ring-fence the six or eight genuine cases . . . what the implications are . . . I want to licence those boats if we can do this".  This was to the point.Regarding the sunken boats capacity, I will read an extract from a note.  It states: "Piecemeal changes in policy in response to special pleadings from individuals where these changes would run totally contrary to policy objectives, give large unrequited gains to these individuals and open up numerous other equally ‘meritorious' claims, cannot be recommended".  However, a handwritten note by the then Minister on the bottom of this note states: "Go ahead with proposals subject to conditions laid down".Another document relates to a meeting between two potential applicants and Deputy Fahey.  The applicants referred to a proposed condition that was causing them a problem.  How did they know the conditions a long time before the scheme was even announced?  According to the applicants, the condition in question was raising money from financial institutions.  This document is staggering and points to major personal considerations and political interference by the Minister.I also have a document in which the Department wrote to the fish producer organisations informing them of the scheme.  Most damning is a telephone call made by Mr. Eddie Sheehan of Castletownbere.  Correspondence regarding that call states:There was a strong view among fishermen on the ground that this was a back door scheme for particular fishermen who were getting favourable treatment.  He argued that the scheme was unfair and gave special treatment to a particular group while most fishermen were required to buy replacement tonnage.  He said that this scheme raised the same concerns as the "Dingle scheme" where political consideration determined the allocation of licences.

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	298	According to this document, Mr. Sheehan "advised that there is strong feeling at local level and a group of fishermen are coming together to take the Minister to court for not applying licensing policy in a fair and even handed manner".  A note from Ms Kelly states: "I explained that any significant change in policy in relation to licensing and registration of fishing vessels was discussed with industry representatives".  This was a warning from the representatives that they would be taking the Minister to court.The next document in the ombudsman's report to which I would like to refer regards the use of capacity for replacement purposes.  It is a letter from the Minister's secretary to Ms Kelly.  It states: "Draft letter for issue by the Minister in respect of owners who have made representation to him".  The attached asterisk is explained at the bottom of the page — the two owners were Mr. Paddy Mullen and Mr. Tony Faherty.  How the former Minister can say that everything was above board, I do not know.What occurred and has been highlighted by my colleagues was tragic.  The Byrne family did not qualify.  The first qualifying criterion in the fishing vessels lost at sea scheme for replacing capacity requires the applicant to be the owner and skipper or a registered Irish sea fishing boat.  This condition exempted the Byrne family because the poor man was lost at sea with his son.  His wife was at home trying to raise eight young children, so the family could not qualify.  The scheme was designed and ring-fenced — I will use the former Minister's own words — for six or eight people.

Of 17 applications from County Donegal, only one was successful.  Of 14 applications from County Kerry, only one was successful.  Of four applications from County Galway, two were successful.  They were constituents of the then Minister.  If he maintains that everything he did was right, then the Ombudsman must be wrong.

An attempt to vilify Deputy Fahey for the way in which he introduced the scheme and for the way in which it was subsequently conducted has been ongoing for many years.  Deputy Sheahan has surprised me, as he is continuing along the same lines.  That is unfair because Deputy Fahey, the former Minister, has set out exactly what he did and how the scheme operated over the years.  It is obvious that he acted with complete integrity throughout the affair and he has rebutted every argument made against him this afternoon.  I do not know why the Opposition and Fine Gael in particular want to maintain this tack, which that party commenced.For me, the question is where will we go from here in terms of the Ombudsman and the future conduct of that office.  I understand it to be the case that, in the UK, if there is a dispute between an ombudsman and a Department or so on, the matter goes before a parliamentary committee.

Unfortunately, the then Government fell and a new Committee on Finance and the Public Service came into being.  It also supported the decision and a report was laid before the Dáil in February 2008.Now that we have this report, where do we go from here?

Perhaps the House must consider this situation.  How do we want the Ombudsman's office to operate?  Should it continue to operate in the same way?

Many questions surround the decision in this case because it refers to compensation and a monetary figure.  The scheme was not about that and instead dealt with tonnage.As legislators we must consider whether we must change the legislation to see if other structures could be put in place and if we should strengthen the position of the Ombudsman to where a Department would have to accept the decision put forward by the Ombudsman or if we revert to a position in other jurisdictions in that we could send it to a parliamentary committee.  There is no point in saying we should do this or that at the moment as we must work within the legislative structures we currently have.I know from Deputy Fahey's comments and what the Minister of State has said that there are very grave reservations in the Department on what has transpired and the precedent that may be set for the future.  As a Legislature we must consider the system as it operates from now on, not only as regards this case but with regard to the case I previously mentioned.  If we do not act, we will wonder about the operation of that office in future.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I can vividly recall that terrible tragedy in October 1981 when the Skifjord was lost with the loss of five lives.  It was the third such tragedy off the Donegal coast during the 1970s and early 1980s.  Two of those who were lost were from the same family, Francis Byrne and his young son Jimmy, who was 16 years old.  Three others were also lost — Des McGovern, Jimmy Lafferty and Tony O’Brien.  Unfortunately, the remains of two who perished in that awful disaster — those of Francis himself and Des McGovern — were never brought ashore.I remember being at St. Conal's Church in Bruckless on that October night in 1981, when the remains of young Jimmy were brought in.  I also remember Mrs. Byrne and her eight young children, aged from two years to 17, coming to the front seat of that church.  It was a sad spectacle, with a widow and eight young children, none of whom had reached the age of majority.  Mrs. Byrne lost a husband and son in that tragedy.I am not against the scheme in principle and when there is a loss at sea, people ought to be compensated and tonnage ought to be replaced.  I have absolutely nothing against that but I have everything against the underhand way in which the scheme was carried out.  In plain political language, it has every indication and manifestation of a political stroke, nothing more and nothing less.As a representative of that constituency, I was angry that when the family eventually found out such a scheme existed, it was out of fishing because it could not buy a new boat.  The family members had been out of fishing for many years before the scheme was announced but that does not mean some would not get back into fishing if they had the opportunity.  The scheme was announced and closed a year afterwards.  The family approached the Department dealing with marine and fisheries matters but the people there told the family they had never heard of the Skifjord tragedy.  What kind of a Department is that and what sort of people are working in it?  The family had insult added to injury; not alone would the Department not accept a late application but the family was told that the Department personnel had never heard of the tragedy in which five young Irish men — fathers and brothers — were drowned at sea.That is enough for me to know what was behind the scheme.  It is obvious that the scheme had two tracks, an inside track and an outside track.  It was a tailor-made scheme for certain people and they had to cover themselves.  Crumbs were given out but the major benefits of the scheme went to favoured people.  I do not care what denials comes from anyone on that side and that is how I see it.  It angers me that the Department is carrying on in that way.I have been a Member of this House for almost 30 years and I have had many dealings with the Department.  I do not say it lightly when I say it is one of the most difficult, mysterious, non-transparent, enigmatic and opaque Departments that I know of, and there are 15 of them.  Nothing is as it seems; it is smoke and mirrors.  What we are discussing today is just the tip of the iceberg of what has been going on in the Department through the years.Fishing licences — very valuable assets — have been given out, along with grants and quotas, on a political basis.  That cannot be contradicted.  Licences and quotas have been politically-traded commodities.  I can put it in no other way.  There is a culture of nods, winks and nudges running through the Department and what we are discussing today is only one example brought to light by the determination of the Byrne family, which has suffered a grievous loss, and the diligence and support of the Ombudsman.  I salute the Ombudsman for taking up this case and following it diligently on behalf of this family, which has lost so much to the seas and the fishing industry.We will bury this report this afternoon and the shutters are down again in the Department.  I will not blame the officials sitting beside the Minister of State.  They are just officials and can go between Departments while subject to political direction.  The gates have been closed and locked and the report will be obfuscated.  We have had perfunctory statements in the Dáil this afternoon for an hour or two; after that the report will be buried and things will proceed as normal.It is not acceptable to me and I hope it is not acceptable to anybody on this side of the House.  I do not know whether I will be here but I look forward to the day when some courageous Minister will go into that Department, open it up and see what is contained in the files and in the bowels of that Department.  It should be opened and made transparent.  Nothing should be given out on a political basis in this country and everybody has rights.  We are all citizens of the country but that has not been the way the Department has been ruled.I seldom agree with Deputy Ferris on many issues but I agree with him on this.  The Department is badly in need of reform.  I hope somebody will come along and do it before I leave this House.  I look forward to it.Deputy Fahey, who was a Minister of State at the time, has said he has been vindicated.  I also went through the Ombudsman's report and neither the Deputy nor the Department has been vindicated.  There was maladministration in the Department.  The report states there was poor administration, with Department officials failing to meet the required standards by fair or sound administration in the dealings with families covered in this report.It was also stated that the design of the scheme and the manner in which it was advertised was contrary to fair and sound administration.  If I were the Minister, I would be very concerned with a finding like that coming from the Ombudsman.I am sure the officials here were opposed to the scheme because they saw it for what it was.  They had to go along with the wishes of the Minister of the day.  I do not expect any of the officials to admit it because if they did they would be looking for another job.  That is the way it is.  They are loyal to the Minister of the day and that is the way it goes, but we see through it.  The Minister of State was determined to push ahead with the scheme, regardless of the consequences.  There were people on the inside track and people on the outside track.  My constituents were unfortunately on the outside track, because they were not from the right constituency.The report mentions "faulty design" and "unfair advantage to some applicants".  These are the findings of the Ombudsman.  The report found the family at the centre of the complaint was adversely affected while some prospective applicants were put in a more advantageous position.  Is that the way to conduct the public affairs of a republic?  The report states that some people were written to directly by the Department and the Minister of State to inform them about the scheme when it was launched.  When my constituents, who suffered so grievously, went to the Department the officials had never heard of them nor of the terrible tragedy that they suffered.  That beggars belief.I hope that this report will not be buried at 3.30 p.m. when this debate comes to an end.  There is a majority on the other side of the House but, as has been said, "A majority has no right to do wrong".  Members of the other side of the House will know who I am quoting when I say that.  He was one of the great chiefs who used to sit over where the Minister is currently sitting now.  A majority has no right to do wrong.  The Government had a majority in the House this morning and it voted 68 to 63 to bury the report.  If this does not go to a committee, I will be looking for a judicial inquiry and to have the issue opened up.  We need to get the truth out and then reform the Department in the process.

It is a pity that those people had to be caught up in this inquiry.  No matter what inquiry takes place, it is important that facts are established and that we do not deal with fiction.  Unfortunately, some fiction has crept in here.The Ombudsman invited spokespersons from the Opposition parties, namely Sinn Féin, Labour and Fine Gael, for a briefing on a report this week in advance of this debate.  If this is the case, maybe Deputies Creed, Sherlock or Ferris might explain what that was about.

However, being in an independent position, the Ombudsman should have spoken to spokespersons from all sides of this House, and not three political parties.

If he sticks to the facts, we might get somewhere on this.  The Ombudsman invited the Deputy and two other Members of this House to a meeting.  Why was the Ombudsman not acting independently in calling for that meeting?  It was not an independent meeting because all parties were not represented at it.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	333	That is disgraceful.  She has been in correspondence with the Minister for months.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	336	This is part of the Fianna Fáil agenda to undermine the Office of the Ombudsman.

I question if it is unusual for an officeholder of such independent standing to make such an invitation.  That is a relevant question.  The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources informed the Ombudsman that the sole objective and purpose of the scheme was to enable qualifying applicants, who were otherwise unable to do so for financial and other reasons, to provide a replacement capacity for the purpose of introducing a replacement fishing vessel, in respect of fishing boats lost at sea between 1980 and the establishment of the new fishing boat register in 1990, in order to continue a family tradition of sea fishing in situations where immediate family members were engaged in the industry.  The objective and purpose of the scheme was clear, transparent and unambiguous.If any Minister was to set up a similar scheme to keep the family fishing tradition going——

While money was not as available then as it is now, we would all welcome it.The Ombudsman's report also states that the scheme did not provide financial support to successful applicants for the acquisition of a replacement fishing vessel and the replacement capacity.  I am referring to the gross tonnage.  The Ombudsman further states she fully accepts that successful applicants were granted replacement tonnage under the scheme, rather than compensation.  If she accepts that, why turn around and bring compensation back into the agenda again?
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I ask the Deputy not to cast reflections on the Ombudsman or to personalise the office in any way.  The Office of the Ombudsman is independent of the Dáil and has its own way of going about things.  I ask the Deputy to be careful.
#NiallBlaneyIND	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-party	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-dob	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I accept that.  I accept the independence of the Ombudsman, even if I do not understand the conclusions of this report.  I fully accept that there was no compensation involved in the scheme, yet one of the recommendations is to give compensation.The real issue is the fact that former Deputy Jim Higgins acted in the way he did.  He took his own interpretation of the lost at sea scheme and he did not check any of the facts, but then sent it on to the Ombudsman for investigation.  I fear that much of this non-factual information was believed.  I wonder if the former Deputy was the problem, because as far as I can see, the Byrne family in Donegal were misled by Jim Higgins MEP to the point——
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Jim Higgins MEP is not a Member of this House and is not in a position to refute what you are saying, so I ask you to be careful about what you say.

It is clearly established in the Ombudsman's report that this is not possible.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	344	This is a comical contribution.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	346	No more than the Ombudsman.

The investigation was set up in the belief it was the case and it has now been established not to be the case.  We have had fairytale investigations in this House in the past and I do not believe we should start another.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I bet Deputy Blaney does not.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	350	That is what it is all about.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Among the points made by Deputy Creed was that the matter should be referred to the relevant Oireachtas committee for a thorough and detailed examination.  It would be difficult if not impossible to undertake a more thorough and detailed examination than that of the Ombudsman.  Deputy Creed may be surprised I agree with him on one point.  In view of how this issue has been handled, there is a danger the Office of the Ombudsman may be undermined in a shoddy manner.  Rather than dealing with the issues, at this early stage of this debate——
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	353	It is the end of the debate, according to the Minister of State.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	354	——it is descending into a political football.  It does not need to.  I remind Deputy Creed that the legislation was introduced by a Fianna Fáil-led Government, contrary to what he said.  He also made a reasonable point that in the previous case the hearing committee did not lead to the outcome sought by the Ombudsman.  That is accurate, unlike much of what was said in the Chamber.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	355	It recommended it.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The point is made that in this instance if the report is not complied with in full it undermines the Office of the Ombudsman.  Why did that not happen in the previous instance?  Deputy Creed also warned against selective quotations.  The difficulty for all of us is that we have little time.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	357	That was determined by the Government side.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I ask him to look at the rest of the appendices, particularly section F, with regard to what he quoted.  He also referred to advertising and claims the former Minister muddied the waters.  The former Minister holds a particular view.  Deputy Creed must recognise that people are entitled to hold a view and it does not have to be the same view as that of others.  I hold the view that the advertising campaign was reasonable and well directed.  I am not sure that if it was in all the daily newspapers, the family concerned or others who should have known about it would have had a better chance.  I do not accept that is the case and I am entitled to hold that view.  I am entitled to say it.  A number of speakers have contended I am not entitled to have a view or to express it.  That is a dangerous development.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13574	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	359	On a point of order, that is not what we said.  I want to be clear about this——
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I did not interrupt Deputy Sherlock.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13574	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The Minister of State expressed his view on the motivation of the families——
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Deputy Sherlock does not have the floor.  I know this matter is very close to his heart but at the moment the Minister of State has the floor.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	364	Deputy Creed also made the floodgates argument and suggested we should step out of the straitjacket.  Is he sure that is the appropriate thing to do in these or other circumstances?I refer to the points made by Deputy Sherlock and the extraordinary attack with regard to what he claims was my attack on the motivation of the family.  The motivation of the family is entirely irrelevant.  I set the terms of the scheme before the House and the facts with regard to how it was considered by the departmental officials then and now.  I will return to this point presently.Deputy Sherlock also suggested the Ombudsman found maladministration.  That is at variance with what the Ombudsman said in her report.  It is worth looking at what she said on this point.  Deputy Sherlock also made the point that this carry-on undermines the Office of the Ombudsman.  If we confine ourselves to the points made by the Ombudsman and set aside our personal views, which is very difficult for me and everyone else, we can examine the nub of the issue.  However, this is very different to much of what has been said today.  The point made by Deputy Creed about previous experiences is relevant in that regard.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food routinely works with the Ombudsman, probably to as great an extent as any other Department.  The Department routinely accepts and complies with the findings of the Ombudsman, as do many other Departments.  Any attempt to suggest that is not the case is inaccurate.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	365	Will the Department accept this?

Deputy Sherlock is suggesting I do not have the right to say anything.  If I said that he would have quickly suggested I was insulting House by refusing to explain further.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	367	This is different.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13574	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The Minister of State gave us 39 paragraphs.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The Deputy went on to suggest I was questioning the motives of the family.  I was explaining the context of the scheme and how it would seem to apply to the family.  We must be careful not to ignore the imposition of a totalitarian, Trotskyite approach so that I do not have the right to hold an opinion or have the temerity to comment.  We must be careful because this is a House of Parliament.  Anyone can hold a view and can enunciate it and should not be shot down for holding it or enunciating it.  Deputy Sherlock could usefully examine the provisions of the 1980 Act, particularly in respect of the role of the Oireachtas in these matters.Deputy Martin Ferris referred to tragedies, as we all have done.  A competition to outdo each other in this regard would be unseemly and unfair to the families involved.  Deputy Ferris seemed to be under the impression that the Department arrived at the compensation figure but that is not the case.  That applies to a different scheme, as set out in the report.  In 1990 everyone received tonnage free of charge.  That was the beginning of the scheme.Another point was why the Department contacted 16 individuals.  The Department could only contact the people it knew about and it is interesting that only two of the 16 individuals qualified.  Had the Department not contacted those who were known, we would be in more trouble.Deputy Ferris also claimed the Department is corrupt or that some officials are corrupt.  I am not sure what he meant and it is something he should address at a future date.  He sought a forensic examination but in my view this has already been completed.Deputy Frank Fahey took the opportunity to clarify matters.  Regarding Deputy Niall Blaney, I have no difficulty with the Ombudsman briefing Opposition Members.  We have much interaction with the Office of the Ombudsman in any event and I am aware I could have had a briefing.Deputy Brendan Kenneally referred to an important point about the 1990 Act, that there is no procedure to deal with these matters.  Deputy McGinley referred to constituents and that one incident was the third such tragedy in a short period of time in his area.  In some senses I am taken by Deputy McGinley's point that it would be wonderful if we could find a way to compensate all of these people for their losses.  Unfortunately, the scheme we are talking about was not set out in that manner.  I understand his point when he suggests distress was added to when officials in the Department did not know about the Skifjord  case but that is unfortunately the case.  Some of what Deputy McGinley said was grossly unfair to officials.  It was not what Deputy McGinley intended and it was important that he excluded officials present.Deputy Sheahan referred to an official who he claimed played a starring role.  In so far as that can could be construed as a derogatory remark Deputy Sheahan should reconsider it.

However, it is open to be construed as derogatory.It is important to remind all Members that Ministers routinely meet constituents and officials all the time.  Much of the time, Ministers meet officials about cases referred to them by colleagues in this House.  Quite frequently these representations are from the Opposition benches.  We must be very careful that we do not set up barriers that are artificial and that cannot be sustained by the realities of life.Deputy Sheahan also referred to taking the Minister to court and that is not unusual in this sector.  Deputy Sheahan was also under the impression the family could not have qualified because two members had drowned.  That is incorrect.  A relative of a large tranche of the family could have qualified and did in some cases.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I deplore the recent killings.  They are further evidence of the callous disregard for human life and community safety shown by members of criminal gangs.  The Garda Síochána is carrying out intensive investigations of all these killings and has made good progress in respect of a number of them.  The Garda Commissioner has kept me briefed on these events.In setting the policing priorities for the Garda Síochána in 2010, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to continue the focus of the force on serious crime, in particular organised crime.  This priority is reflected in the Garda policing plan for this year which has just been published.It has to be accepted that, as is the case in every jurisdiction, there can be considerable difficulties for police investigators in obtaining evidence relating to gangland murders.  Associates of a victim of a gangland killing are often criminals themselves and do not co-operate with Garda investigations.  They frequently fail to co-operate even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  There is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator.  Witnesses may be also subject to high levels of intimidation to influence them not to come forward.It was against this background that last year I introduced a series of strong but necessary anti-gangland legislative measures, in particular, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act.  I have consistently made it clear that it will inevitably take time for the full effects of that legislation to become clear.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that the Garda Síochána has been making full use of the legislation since it was enacted in order to build up criminal cases against gangland figures.  The Garda Síochána is painstakingly working to gather evidence that will be sufficient to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions independently to initiate prosecutions of people relating to gangland activities.  A number of Garda investigation files have been already submitted to the DPP.  I am confident that as the evidence accumulates against individuals under these pieces of legislation, successful prosecutions will be taken.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I revert to matters which were debated in the past couple of days under the Fine Gael Private Members' motion.  A number of questions were put to the Minister in the course of that debate which remain unanswered.  How many defendants have appeared in the Special Criminal Court since he rushed through the important legislation to which he refers?  I ask that question against the background of there being 32 murders, 114 threats of murder, 65 kidnappings, some of them vicious, 470 robberies of institutions and 1,986 instances or crimes involving the possession of drugs for sale or supply in this State since the enactment of the legislation.  Having regard to those thousands of crimes committed since last July, will the Minister say how many people appeared before the Special Criminal Court and how many were successfully convicted by that court?

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	409	The Garda Síochána Inspectorate was established under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and forms a key part of the arrangements which the Government has put in place to support the Garda Síochána in pursuing best policing practice across the range of its functions.  This report was mandated by my predecessor and I welcome its findings. It is the sixth such report and its focus is on the allocation of Garda resources.The best international police forces undergo a continual process of development and improvement and the Garda Síochána has engaged in a major programme of reform in recent years including in the use of technology.  The reports of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate are an important part of that process and have been very supportive of the reforms underway in the force.  As part of that ongoing process, the Garda Commissioner and his management team have enthusiastically implemented the majority of recommendations contained in the previous inspectorate reports and will continue to do so.  Progress in implementing the recommendations is updated regularly on the websites of both the force and the inspectorate.This report contains many positive recommendations on how the fluctuating demand for policing services can be better measured and how Garda resources can be efficiently deployed to meet that demand.  Key to this will be the use of technology, such as command and control, computer-aided dispatch, and human resource, HR, systems and the introduction of new and more effective roster systems.  The aim is to maximise the number of frontline gardaí in the right place at the right time, building on the significant investment recently made in Garda technology and resources.These are significant and welcome recommendations which should be of significant assistance to the Garda Commissioner and his team as they build on recent progress in making maximum use of resources.  Garda management already has a series of well-developed proposals for many of the key initiatives envisaged in the report, such as a new command and control system, a new computer-aided despatch system and a new human resource management system.  This ambitious programme builds on the recent and unprecedented investment in Garda technology which has seen the new national digital radio service being rolled out across the force, a new automated fingerprint and ballistics identification system, a new automated number plate recognition system and significant enhancements to the Pulse system.  In all, investment in Garda ICT programmes is currently running at approximately €70 million per year and in this coming year, it is estimated to be more than €80 million.I welcome the report and will fully support the Garda Commissioner as he continues to implement and expand a wide-ranging programme of reform which effectively addresses the issues identified in it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Does the Minister agree this is a very disturbing report on the operational condition of the Garda Síochána?  It paints a picture, albeit in polite language, of a police force as it might have operated in 1950s Ireland in terms of management techniques, deployment of manpower, absence of technology, rostering systems, the failure of the civilianisation effort and so on.  Law-abiding citizens must be horrified at what is revealed in this report by the Garda inspectorate.  What is the Minister's response to the statement by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors that most Garda stations do not even have e-mail facilities?  Does the Minister agree with the 27 recommendations in this report?  If so, will he indicate a timeframe for their implementation?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	411	In regard to the Deputy's question on e-mail capabilities, Internet facilities are available at 347 network locations within the Garda Síochána.  Moreover, internal e-mail facilities are provided to all ranks of the force via the PULSE environment.  As I said, there has been a dramatic increase in the degree of usage of information and communications technologies by gardaí, with investment running at €70 million per year and more than €80 million expected to be invested in 2010.  Last year, as part of this investment, €23 million was expended on the national digital radio system and €1.1 million on the automated fingerprinting system.I do not agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the report in question points to the Garda as a force embedded in the 1950s.  That is not so.  The Government and the Oireachtas must be given credit for putting in place, in 2005, the infrastructure to ensure the Garda could be benchmarked against best international practice.  That is what this report is about.  There will always be improvements to implement and scope for the allocation of additional resources.  When I became Minister in this Department just under two years ago, I made it one of my primary objectives that priority be given to investment in the Garda, in prisons and in the criminal justice system, regardless of what else was happening with the Department's budget.  I stand on my record in that regard.  The Estimates for this year and last indicate an investment in the Garda Síochána of €1.6 billion, which is a record.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I do not ask this question in any spirit of confrontation.  The view I have outlined is that of the Garda inspectorate, as set out in this serious review, and there is no point in trying to whitewash it.  The Minister should not try to dodge the question about how many Garda stations have e-mail by referring to network connections.I draw the Minister's attention to the number of gardaí who are tied up in duties that could be done by civilians.  The civilianisation programme has been used only to recruit additional civilians, not to release gardaí from administrative duties to the front line of fighting crime.  The Minister says he has done X and Y since assuming office.  Let us look at an example of what he has done.  He has issued instructions regarding the requirement on gardaí to take a long-hand note of interviews even though they are now electronically conducted, but no progress has been made on this matter.  The Minister tells me that a pilot programme is at an advantaged stage but, because of the complexities involved, it is likely that any new system will take some time to complete and, therefore, a definitive timeframe cannot be given.  What can be so complicated about taking the necessary action to ensure valuable Garda time is no longer wasted in taking long-hand notes of electronically recorded interviews?  What does it take to bring modern management procedures to bear on the operation of the Garda Síochána?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The practice of taking handwritten notes while also having the interviews videotaped is part of the preparation for bringing a prosecution to court.  My Department and the Garda Síochána are working with the Director of Public Prosecutions on the requirements regarding the type of evidence that is acceptable in a prosecution.  Even though every interview is videotaped, it is still important, in order to present evidence in court, to have a written synopsis of a witness's statement.  On the basis of the entitlement of every person to a fair trial, the Garda must err on the side of caution in terms of how a case is presented.  That is done on the basis of the requirements and directions of the DPP.

I am certainly not engaged in any whitewash.  I very much welcome this report which is an indicator of the excellent work being done by the inspectorate in endeavouring to benchmark the Garda progressively as it implements changes in keeping with best international practice.  To be fair to the Garda Commissioner and his management, the vast majority of the recommendations previously made by the inspectorate have already been implemented.  I expect the same to happen in this instance.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	416	The Minister has no role in it.  It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Statistics published by the Central Statistics Office show that the number of recorded cases of rape increased by 10.2% in 2009 compared to 2008, whereas in 2008 they decreased by 2.8% and in 2007 by 4.1%.  With regard to the number of rape and sexual assault cases before the courts, they decreased by 37.2% in 2009, whereas in 2008 they increased by 6.8% and in 2007 by 25.9%.  This shows that in any year, there is no relationship between the number of cases recorded and the number of cases before the courts.  There is inevitably a time lag between the recording of a complaint of rape and the appearance of the case in the courts, as a result of the investigation and detection process, the submission of an investigation file to the DPP and the preparation of the book of evidence.I welcome the apparent increased willingness of complainants to report rape and other sexual offences and the changes in society, the law and public administration which have contributed to that trend.  Changes that have been made to the legal system in this area include providing separate legal representation for the complainant, with the aim of allaying concerns he or she may have without breaching the fundamental principle of an accused's right to a fair trial.  However, despite such positive developments, there remains a high attrition rate in rape cases, and a large number of cases reported to the Garda Síochána do not reach the courts for a variety of reasons.The Government's commitment to tackling sexual violence is reflected in the establishment in June 2007 within my Department of Cosc, the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Cosc is currently developing a national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence for the five-year period from 2010 to 2014.  This strategy will draw on the broad consultation that has taken place with interested persons and organisations.  Several published studies relating to attrition in rape cases are being carefully examined in this context.  The strategy is close to completion and will be considered by Government shortly.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I welcome the establishment of Cosc but there remain matters of some significance to consider.  It is disturbing that while incidences of reporting of rape are increasing substantially year on year, the number of cases being prosecuted in courts has fallen dramatically.  Is the Minister aware of a recent report, undertaken by Rape Crisis Network Ireland, which highlights deficiencies that require addressing?  Does he agree that there is a need for the Garda Síochána to engage in specialist training to deal with complainants?  There appears to be evidence that on occasion, the Garda is second-guessing the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on the matter of whether a victim wishes to proceed with a case.  Can I ask the Minister to take steps to ensure there is a high degree of positive relationship and contact between the Garda, on behalf of the State, and complainants prior to cases coming to court?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I thank the Deputy for his remarks about Cosc.  Since its establishment, Cosc has spent approximately €280,000 on an awareness campaign.  It encourages and liaises with complainants and non-governmental organisations in this area.  Europe-wide research on attrition rates shows that Ireland's reporting rate ranked in the middle of the range.  The research found that Ireland is similar to England, Wales, Scotland and Sweden, in the sense that most attrition takes place in the early and middle stages of the investigation.  That happens for a number of reasons.  If non-governmental organisations, including Rape Crisis Network Ireland and others, wish to make suggestions and recommendations, they will be examined in the context of any legislative or policy change that may be necessary.  It is important to emphasise that while there may be fluctuations in rape convictions, or in rape cases coming before the courts, in some instances offenders are charged with sexual offences other than rape.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I thank the Minister for the invitation to submit further recommendations.  I ask him to examine legislative changes along the lines of the changes made in Britain in recent times, with particular reference to evidence.  The real problem with the question of admissibility of evidence in rape cases is that it can undermine the criminal justice system.  I refer specifically to evidence of the sexual history of the complainant.  In addition, complainants are bound by law to make a complaint at the first reasonable opportunity.  We need to reflect closely on those aspects of the question of admissibility of evidence that are giving rise to concern and, in many ways, are responsible for this country's very low conviction rate.  I ask the Minister to examine the changes that have been made in Britain and to report back to this House on the matter within six months.

A decision on whether a complainant's previous history should be opened up in court, or is relevant to the case in question, is best left to the trial judge, in the absence of the jury.  The exclusion or inclusion of such evidence is fraught with difficulties.  I think the current practice should continue.  It is obvious that we will continue to consider what is happening in other jurisdictions, and perhaps learn from the mistakes that have been made in this respect.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	424	The Garda central vetting unit provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations that are registered with the Garda for this purpose and employ people in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to work with children and/or vulnerable adults.  The Teaching Council is registered with the unit to submit vetting applications in respect of new teachers.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that all applications received from the Teaching Council in respect of new teachers are processed in accordance with the unit's standard operating procedures.  The results in respect of each applicant are disclosed to the registered organisation.  In line with the framework of the implementation group on Garda vetting, in which the various stakeholders are brought together, consultations are taking place with the relevant education stakeholders on how best to introduce the vetting of existing teachers, which is expected to commence later this year.  The vetting of a body of employees of the size of the cohort of existing teachers would present a challenge to any system.  The Garda authorities will maximise the resources at their disposal in managing this development.I cannot accept the Deputy's contention that there is a significant backlog in the vetting process.  The current average processing time for valid vetting applications received at the vetting unit is approximately six weeks.  This processing time fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands, when the volume of applications received from certain sectors, including the education sector, can increase.  The time required to process a individual vetting application can be longer if clarification is required from the registered organisation as to the details provided, or if other inquiries need to be made.  The strategic expansion of the Garda vetting service is taking place by means of a phased roll-out to an increasing number of organisations in the child and vulnerable adult care sectors.  This target group is the clear policy priority.  It is necessary to phase the expansion of vetting to prevent an unmanageable surge in vetting application numbers, which would likely lead to an administrative logjam.  This expansion will continue until vetting is provided for all personnel working in a full-time, part-time or voluntary capacity with children or vulnerable adults.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	425	Can I express disappointment with the Minister's reply, which seems to fly in the face of the facts as far as the vetting unit is concerned?  I compliment those involved in the unit, in so far as their resources allow or facilitate them to undertake the duties they are statutorily required to undertake.  Will the Minister comment on a recent report which suggested that up to 40,000 teachers are awaiting vetting, but cannot receive their vetting clearance because of inadequacies in the system?  It is entirely unsustainable and intolerable in the context of the requirement for vetting.  How can his Department stand over the reality that it will take up to four years to clear the backlog under the current regime?

All new teachers are vetted within a relatively short space of time.  I am informed that the current average processing time, based on the figures for the last couple of months, is between four and five weeks.  That is in contrast with an average processing time of six weeks in 2009.  The issues with the existing cohort of teachers will be dealt with on a phased basis.

Some 218,000 applications were received in 2008, with an average processing time of between four and five weeks.  Some 246,000 applications were received in 2009.  Approximately 18,000 organisations receive vetting services for employment purposes.  There is a massive involvement in the vetting process.  The vetting unit has a total staffing complement of 78, the vast majority of whom are civilians.  One Garda superintendent and five Garda sergeants are attached to the unit — the rest of its staff are civilians.  The dramatic growth of this area is demonstrated by the increase in the staff complement over the last three years, from 13 in 2006 to 78 at present.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	429	The difficulty is that the Minister has not addressed the question of how he will meet the significant backlog.  He has expressed some surprise about how busy the vetting unit is, but that was always going to be the case in light of its responsibilities.  I would like to know why the backlog is so stark.  There are people emigrating from this country on a daily basis.  Nurses who cannot get jobs in this country, as a result of current Government policy, cannot take up the employment they are being offered outside his jurisdiction because they do not have vetting certificates from Thurles.  Is this an information technology problem?  Is it a personnel problem?  Is it a resource problem?  I asked the Minister to outline the steps he proposes to take to address the backlog.  He spoke about the backlog and stated it would take some time.  By my reckoning, it would take up to five years to deal with the teachers' cohort alone.  Is the Minister suggesting that he does not intend to take any steps?

As I stated in my first reply, to which the Deputy obviously did not listen, in respect of consultation with the various stakeholders on the implementation group on Garda vetting, consultations are taking place with the relevant educational stakeholders as to how to best introduce the vetting of existing teachers.  This will be done in such a way that it will not lead to a completely unmanageable situation whereby a massive backlog would be created.  It will be done on a phased basis.  I again revert to the figures, which demonstrate that within just three years, the figures have risen from 137,000 applications dealt with to 246,000 such applications.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	436	That was always going to happen.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	440	As the Deputy is aware, in September last year I published a consultation paper on a proposed new immigration regime for full-time non-EEA students.  The consultation paper was prepared, in consultation with the relevant key Departments, following a review by my own Department of the operation of the current student regime.  That review had been undertaken having regard to the need to ensure greater coherence in the way we deal with non-EEA students within our immigration system and the fact that it was generally accepted that there was a need for greater regulation in the student area.As I have stated previously, the Government recognises that international education is a vital industry with significant growth potential and is committed to enhancing Ireland's potential in this area.  The immigration regime for students is a key element in this strategy through providing a visibly strong regulatory environment that safeguards against potential abuses of the system, thereby ensuring that Ireland's reputation as a quality destination for international students is maintained.  At the same time, looking at the bigger immigration picture, it is self-evident that what we do in one area cannot undermine one of the core principles of any immigration system, that is, the State must be satisfied that persons coming to Ireland do so for a genuine purpose and comply with the immigration conditions of their stay.This project has a very strong cross-departmental dimension and what is being done in respect of immigration dovetails with initiatives announced by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, in the area of quality assurance, rationalisation of accreditation structures and marketing of the Irish educational product abroad.  The two Departments have been working very closely together on this matter. My Department is also engaged with the industry and is receptive to any realistic proposals that facilitate the development of the industry without compromising our immigration system.Underlying the approach adopted in the consultation paper was a realisation that the current "one size fits all" regime for students no longer is appropriate and, therefore, a more flexible and differentiated system is being proposed.  The paper also acknowledges the reality that for most non-EEA nationals, the only real avenue to come to Ireland for low-skilled or casual work is as a registered student, thereby creating a significant incentive for the student route to be a channel for economic migration.  This is a challenge for immigration systems worldwide.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.In fact it is the root cause of most of the problems experienced in managing student immigration.The consultation paper contained a set of draft proposals for the reform of the student sector and invited submissions on those proposals by 9 October 2009.  In summary, the key proposals include a cap on the length of time a person can spend in Ireland as a student, the targeting of certain incentives to identified sectors within the student immigration stream, the introduction of a tighter inspection regime and possible changes to the visa regime.  There was an excellent response from the public during the consultation period with 100 submissions received.  These are being reviewed by an interdepartmental committee on student immigration. The committee is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives from other key Departments including the Departments of Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Foreign Affairs, Arts, Sport and Tourism, Finance, the Taoiseach and others.The work of the committee is ongoing and further meetings are scheduled to take place this month.  However, it is expected that the committee will present its report and recommendations to me in the next few weeks.  The issue will ultimately be submitted to Government.

It obviously has not been introduced yet.  Is it not the case that according to the document the Minister published last September, the new scheme was to be introduced from 1 January 2010?  Where is that new scheme and when will it be implemented?  Does the Minister agree that with a small amount of effort and commitment in this area on the part of the various Departments, an additional €1 billion in badly-needed capital could be brought into this country, thereby creating approximately 6,000 badly-needed new jobs?  When will the new regime be put in place?  Is the Minister satisfied with the current position in which there is such a dramatic inconsistency between the level of refusal encountered in this jurisdiction and that which obtains across the water in the United Kingdom?

It is being considered by an interdepartmental committee on student immigration that is chaired by my Department.  It is to be hoped that the committee will report fairly soon and that the matter will be brought to the Government in the not too distant future.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy that there is great merit in seeking international business by bringing in people from abroad and educating them in Ireland, provided it is done in the context of ensuring that our immigration system is absolutely sacrosanct.Unfortunately, there have been cases in which this has been abused and I can provide Members with some information in this respect.  On inspection some time ago, a college in Dublin 8 had no desks, whiteboards, blackboards, books or papers.  The so-called principal was unwilling to open the doors of the college, which effectively was being used as residential accommodation.  At another college in Cork that was visited, none of the 70 so-called students who were registered was in attendance.  The excuse given was that the students were off on their mid-term break.  This site was visited again during the following month, when only eight students out of 59 were in attendance.  A similar occurrence took place at a college which has branches in Dublin 2 and Dublin 9.  When it was visited by the investigation unit, no students were in attendance——

Undoubtedly, there are difficulties with the current system both in respect of its rigidity and the loopholes it contains.  The sooner we put in place a new scheme, the better for all concerned and for those who are involved in the legitimate industry.  The consultation document is silent on the issue of those in possession of student visas working in this jurisdiction.  In September 2008, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Billy Kelleher, stated that he was reviewing this issue.  As 18 months have passed since then and in light of the co-ordination that now is in place, can the Minister comment on what plans exist in respect of the review of the working conditions on such student visas?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	472	This undoubtedly is an issue that is being considered by the committee and obviously I will await the committee's consideration, as well as the representations and submissions that have been made.  However, it is an issue in that it is being used to an extent by some as an opportunity to come here as economic migrants.  Lest anyone outside the Chamber thinks this is a major cohort, I wish to emphasise it is estimated that this only pertains to 10,000 to 11,000 people.  While some educational interests suggest that 200,000 students come to Ireland for educational purposes, I am unsure whether that figure is correct.  Undoubtedly, however, the vast majority of students who do so are not from non-EEA countries but in the main are from the European Union and do not require a visa at all.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	473	A total of 176 prisoners were granted varying periods of temporary release at Christmas 2009 under the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.  This figure represents approximately 4% of the prisoner population at that time.The periods of release granted to these prisoners varied from a few hours up to seven nights.  The overriding concern when considering the applications was the safety of the public.  While the obvious additional factors taken into account when considering temporary release at Christmas are compassionate and humane considerations, before any determination on the granting of temporary release to a prisoner is made a number of factors have to be taken into account.  These include the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the prisoner relate; the period of the sentence served by the prisoner and period left to serve; the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the prisoner be released; the prisoner's previous criminal record; the risk of the prisoner failing to return to the prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release; any reports or recommendation made by the governor, the Garda Síochána, a probation officer, or any other person who may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release; the risk that the prisoner might commit an offence during any period of temporary release; the risk of the prisoner failing to comply with the conditions of temporary release; and the likelihood that a period of temporary release might assist the prisoner's eventual full release and their reintegration into society or improve his or her prospects of obtaining employment.As of 1 February 2010, four prisoners out of the 176 prisoners released at Christmas have failed to return to custody.  Experience has shown that it is likely that these offenders will shortly be returned to custody by the Garda Síochána to complete their sentences.The Prison Service utilises temporary release as part of its programme of sentence management.  Temporary release is used to facilitate the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners into society.  Rather than releasing prisoners straight into the community at the end of their sentence, it is in everyone's interest that prisoners who do not pose a high risk to the public are reintroduced into society in a planned and structured way.  The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared to their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I thank the Minister for his reply.  The fact that four prisoners remain at large raises a serious public safety concern.  Is the Minister concerned about this?  Do these people pose a threat to the safety of the public?  If this continues to be a problem, will the Minister give a commitment to the House that he will speak to the director of the Prison Service?  Will he keep the matter under review?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	475	It is a matter of concern that four people are still at large and when they are returned to prison there will be consequences for them because, to a certain extent, it puts into question the entire system of giving temporary release on compassionate grounds at Christmas, which is a time-honoured practice.  I would hazard a guess on their particular circumstances that, when considering any conditions that they might seek in the future, the fact that they absconded would have to be borne in mind.  By and large over recent decades practice has shown that the vast majority of prisoners return to continue to serve their sentences.  It is an issue we keep under review.

To what did the Christmas release bring the figures for December?  The figures I have from the Prison Service suggest that 174 prisoners were on temporary release in January 2008.  The latest date for which I have figures is July 2009 when it had increased to 614.  That seems to suggest——

In 2004, some 294 prisoners were released at Christmas, while in 2005, some 280 were released.  The figure for 2006 was 230, while it was 138 for 2007.  For 2008, it was 107 and for 2009 it was 174.  The figures are reducing.  Last Christmas, the number we released was just over half of what was released at Christmas 2004.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I asked the Minister to name the people involved in promotions.  His friends are putting it in the newspapers for the Minister.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	519	Over the past ten years, there has been a significant stepping up of prison drug rehabilitation programmes with the objective of seeking to reduce demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-related prisoners.  Particular initiatives include the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes coupled with work, training and education access.  Rehabilitation addresses needs beyond the physical management of addiction and also endeavours to equip individuals with life and vocational skills that may help them reintegrate into society on discharge.Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided by the Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  At present, any person entering prison giving a history of opiate use and testing positive for opioids is offered a medically-assisted symptomatic detoxification if clinically indicated.  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with health care staff other treatment options.  These may include stabilisation on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on maintenance while in prison and when they return to the community on release.  Prisoners who on committal are engaged in a methadone substitution programme in the community will in the main have their methadone substitution treatment continued while in custody.Mountjoy, Dochas, Cloverhill, Wheatfield, Midlands and Portlaoise Prisons and St. Patrick's Institution offer methadone maintenance and detoxification treatment.  Merchants Quay Ireland provides a full range of counselling services to these prisons.  Loughan House, Shelton Abbey, Cork and Castlerea Prisons are also serviced by Merchants Quay Ireland who provide addiction counselling services which are in the main focused on alcohol and cannabis addictions and are abstinence driven.  In Limerick Prison there are two models of counselling in operation — an abstinence based model and a harm reduction model.  The counselling service is provided by Merchants Quay Ireland and ALJEFF Treatment Centre.  Methadone substitution treatment is provided if clinically indicated.  Merchants Quay Ireland and Coolmine provide a counselling service to the training unit.It is the intention of the Prison Service, in line with its drugs policy and strategy entitled Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons, to continue the expansion and enhancement of drug treatment services across the prison system and to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through enhanced security measures as well as education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The drugs policy and strategy has witnessed the expansion of drug treatment programmes with the further recruitment of nurses, psychologists and addiction counsellors, as well as other staff including prison officers.  The expansion of these services is being achieved in partnership with community based services and has brought a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment service in the prisons.Specific developments to date include the awarding of a contract for the provision of addiction counsellor services to Merchants Quay Ireland.  Addiction counselling services are available in all but one prison providing an average of 1,500 prisoner contacts per month.  Other developments include the allocation of additional nurse officers and prison officers to dedicated drug treatment teams in a number of prisons with significant needs, improving service quality in prisons; the provision of specialist sessions in addiction psychiatry, significantly improving the quality, co-ordination and availability of drug treatment in prisons; and in Mountjoy Prison a programme has been initiated involving four dedicated addiction nurses, a drug treatment pharmacy service and a clinical addiction team with consultant oversight, which has resulted in a  more streamlined service, better assessment and throughcare outcomes.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The reality is that our prisons are awash with drugs.  In 2004, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, famously promised to rid our jails of drugs within 18 months.  That did not happen.  People are entering our jails without drug problems and leaving addicted to hard drugs.  The only way to break this cycle is through proper rehabilitation for young offenders such as the inmates of St. Patrick's institution.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	521	Has the Deputy a question?
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I was staggered to learn that only one wing of that institution is drug free.  What plans has the Minister devised to improve the rehabilitation services available to young offenders?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Throughout the prison estate, 90 workshops deal with more than 800 prisoners daily.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I am asking about drugs.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	525	These workshops provide employment training and education.  It is a sad fact of Irish society that a large proportion of those who enter our prisons have drug problems.  They have to be dealt with as humanely as possible while they are in prison.  It is fair to say they get the same, if not better, rehabilitation treatment within the prison as they would get outside.Serious efforts are also ongoing on the security side to ensure drug habits are not fed by people smuggling drugs into prisons.  It is a constant battle, as Deputy Charles Flanagan would attest in respect of the prison in his own constituency.  The latest technology and sometimes invasive security techniques are deployed at that prison to prevent the smuggling of drugs and mobile telephones.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	526	We had an opportunity recently to visit Midlands Prison and it is fair to say we were very impressed by the testing procedures in place there for drugs and other contraband.  However, am I not correct in stating that Midlands Prison is an exception and that similarly stringent security provisions are not deployed in other prisons?  Serious problems have arisen in Dublin's prisons in regard to the smuggling of drugs and, sadly, we have to deal with circumstances whereby people who entered prison free of drugs are leaving as addicts.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	527	My experience of the prisons I have visited is that stringent security arrangements are deployed to prevent drug smuggling.  The body orifice security scanning chair and other scanning devices are extremely sensitive to drugs and mobile telephones.  The Deputy probably visited the newer parts of Midlands Prison but significant investments have also been made on improving security in older wings.  However, it is a constant battle because people are devising ever more ingenious methods for smuggling contraband into prisons.  Despite what the Deputy may have read, most of recent disturbances in our prisons were caused by the more stringent regime that has been introduced.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	528	In regard to sanctions on prisoners who continue to use drugs in prisons, will the Minister consider the concept of non-contact or screened visits?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I would leave such decisions to Irish Prison Service officials because they are the experts in this area.  We endeavour to ensure that prisoners do not lose all contact with outside life and that visits are conducted in as humane a manner as possible.  The latest arrangements in Midlands Prison have resulted in a sophisticated operation which prevents smuggling even while keeping visits relatively open for families.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The circumstances surrounding the import of an explosive substance to Ireland from the Slovak Republic on 2 January 2010 are a matter of serious concern to me and to the Government.The background to this incident is that the Dublin Airport authorities contacted the Garda Síochána on 5 January 2010 to inform it that they had received a communication purporting to be from the Slovak authorities apparently to the effect that, due to an error during an airport security test exercise on 2 January 2010 at Poprad-Tatry Airport, a sample package containing explosives was left in the luggage of a passenger who boarded a flight for Dublin.Gardaí moved swiftly to retrieve the explosive substance and, with the assistance of an Army explosive ordnance disposal team, ensured that it did not pose any further danger to the public.  It emerged that the passenger, who had resided in Ireland for a number of years, was completely unaware when he was travelling to Dublin that the sample had been placed in his luggage.I spoke directly with the Slovak Minister of Interior, Mr. Kalinak, about the incident and he gave me an unequivocal apology.  I conveyed to him in the clearest possible terms my deep concern about the situation which had arisen.  It is utterly unacceptable that explosive material should have been placed on an unsuspecting passenger in this way.  I had occasion to meet the official Slovak representative at the recent meeting of EU Justice and Interior Ministers and he conveyed to me the regret of the Slovak authorities and apologised for the incident.  He also indicated that measures have been put in place in Slovakia to avoid a recurrence.The Garda Commissioner has appointed a detective chief superintendent to inquire into all the circumstances surrounding the incident.  That inquiry is ongoing and a report is awaited.  Until the report is available, it is not possible to say for definite how the error occurred in Slovakia and what actions were taken by the authorities there when it was discovered.  I have received an assurance from the Slovak Minister that his officials will fully co-operate with the Garda inquiry and when the report is completed I will consider what further action, if any, is required on my part.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The Minister will be aware of the serious nature of the matter.  I am sure his attention has also been drawn to the fact that his Slovak counterpart narrowly survived a motion of no confidence in the Parliament.The incident raises a number of serious questions for the Minister.  I ask him to indicate to the House the timeline and terms of reference set out for the Garda investigation and report.  I would have thought that it is at an advanced stage at this point and that we would be in a position to examine it in its entirety.With regard to consultation between the Minister and the Minister for Transport on security matters, I note that the proposal to introduce full body scanners at airports has been given a positive reception.  They will be aware, however, that body scanners operate on passengers who are departing rather than those who are arriving.  If security measures in countries such as Slovakia are as lax as this incident would indicate, I suggest that we consider reviewing security at points of entry to the State.  What steps have been taken by way of discussions with appropriate authorities since this incident on the matter of improving security at points of entry?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	532	The internationally accepted and adopted approach to security is that passenger and baggage screening takes place on departure rather than on arrival.  Every country relies on the security arrangements in the departing country.  It is accepted that there are some states where security is not as it should be.  That is something I raised at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in the context of the wider discussion of security, body scanners and other types of security measures that could be implemented.What happened in Slovakia was a bit of an aberration.  I understand it was a relatively small airport that has adequate security but a mistake was made due to human error.  That is something about which we should all be conscious given the fact that groups such as al-Qaeda are using aeroplanes to carry out dastardly operations.  It is something the international community could consider more closely.  I understand the European Commission has asked the Slovakian authorities for a report.  The remit of the detective garda is to investigate all of the circumstances surrounding this incident, both in terms of what happened in Slovakia and in this country.  The Garda acted expeditiously and properly once it was notified on 5 January that this incident had taken place.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I am sure no blame at all attaches to the Garda Síochána in this matter.  I do not understand why investigations into whatever aspect of this kind of matter take so long in this country.  When matters arise that require to be investigated in the public interest, the public has long forgotten what the issue was by the time a report is made.  That seems to be a deliberate tactic of the public administrative-political system.Arising from his discussions with the Slovakian ambassador and any other exchanges that have taken place between the authorities of the two states, is the Minister satisfied that they appreciate the enormity of the negligence demonstrated?  Do they appreciate the implications for the young man who might well have lost his life, or that the human error, as the Minister described it, might have blown an aeroplane out of the sky, and that this young man might have killed his neighbours in Dublin when he came back to reside in this country?  Do the Slovakian authorities appreciate the gravity of what the Minister has described as a "human error"?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	534	They very much do.  As Deputy Flanagan outlined, there was significant political upheaval in Slovakia following the incident.  It was one of the reasons the Minister for the Interior, who happens to be the Deputy Prime Minister of Slovakia was not able to attend the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting, and that the ambassador to Spain attended as his representative.The Slovakian ambassador to Ireland immediately contacted my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs to apologise profusely.  I understand the gravity and the enormity of the situation.  The Deputy is correct; if things had gone wrong at this end people might have been killed.  The concept of the surreptitious planting of devices such as this on a person, even as an exercise, is not something that should be countenanced.  I understand that in this instance the device of itself was not capable of exploding.  I understand also that the Slovakian authorities have moved to ensure it does not happen ever again and that it is banned in their society.  From my own knowledge, I know that it does not happen in this country.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 54 together.As a preliminary to appointment by the Government of the Legal Services Ombudsman in accordance with section 5 of the Legal Services Ombudsman Act 2009, my Department is in dialogue with the Department of Finance on the details of the arrangements for the appointment of the ombudsman and the establishment of his or her office.  My Department also continues to be in consultation with the Bar Council and the Law Society who will be responsible for funding of the office.The Act of 2009 specifies certain policies and principles in regard to the levy to be paid by the Bar Council and the Law Society to cover the approved expenses of the ombudsman.  My Department is considering the form the regulations should take for the purposes of the Act.  Consultation between my Department and relevant interests on the making of such regulations is also a necessary feature of that process.  It is important that the office be established on the most effective cost basis.I hope to be in a position soon to announce the details of the arrangements for the appointment of the ombudsman and the establishment of the office, subject to securing early agreement with the parties mentioned above.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	536	The Minister will be aware of the fact that it is some months now since the appropriate legislation passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was my expectation and that of the members of the public who have an interest in the matter that the appointment would have taken place smartly.  What is the reason for the delay?  I cannot understand how it could take almost a year to conclude the matter.  It should be a relatively straightforward endeavour having regard to the planning that was undertaken.  It was my assumption that in accordance with the legislation significant planning was undertaken by the Department and that once the legislation was passed it would be implemented.  The situation is all the more important given the high number of complaints against members of the legal profession that are being made on a regular basis, especially in regard to property transactions that might have unravelled in the context of the change in valuations of property and people wishing to disengage from property deals, the consequences of which are all too stark for themselves and their finances.

A significant body of work is required to set up the Legal Services Ombudsman's office under the legislation.  As the Deputy is aware, section 19 of the Act specifies that the costs do not accrue to the Exchequer, but come from both branches of the legal profession.  At the same time we have to be sure that the running costs are reasonably efficient and cost effective.  We also have to liaise with the Department of Finance on the type of arrangements vis-à-vis remuneration, but also in regard to the appointment.  As far as I am concerned, and as I indicated to my office, under the legislation the appointment cannot be someone from either profession, which means that the appointment will be an open and transparent arrangement——

Details of the Bill were published in the form of heads in September 2008 and they may be accessed on my Department's website.  The Office of Wards of Court will be replaced by the establishment of the office of the public guardian.  It is intended that the Bill will provide a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adult persons who lack capacity.  The legislation will contain guiding principles to assist carers as well as the court in making decisions on behalf of the person.  The statutory guiding principles will require that any act done or decision made on behalf of the person must be in that person's best interests.The Bill will establish that there is a presumption of capacity and that no intervention in the person's decision-making will take place unless it is necessary having regard to the individual needs and circumstances of the person.  A person shall not be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help them make a decision have been taken without success.  The Bill further provides that any act done or decision made under it must be done or made in a way which is the least restrictive of a person's rights and freedoms.  The Bill will create a new role of personal guardian.  Where a person has been found to lack capacity, a personal guardian can be appointed by the court to make decisions concerning his or her personal welfare or property and affairs.  The primary function of the office of public guardian will be to supervise and monitor the exercise of duties and responsibilities by court appointed personal guardians.

Members of families of wards of court are expressing concern at the handling of investments made by the courts for the benefit of wards.  There is a veil of secrecy and little interaction between those responsible for the maintenance of the investments and the operation of the office and family members who have an interest.  It is causing grave disquiet and it needs to be addressed before the legislation is introduced.

The general scheme of the mental capacity Bill provides for the appointment by the court of a person as a personal guardian with a range of functions, including control of the personal finances of an incapacitated person.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	568	That is not the question I asked.  Does the Minister accept there is public concern about this issue?  What will he do about it?

The proposed legislation provides for the establishment of a court funds office and will include an amendment to the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 to allow him or her to act as auditor of all court funds, including those of wards of court.

Has the Minister been immune from the representations we have been getting from families of wards of court?  They have relatives who are wards of court and who are in receipt of awards, which have been invested in accordance with whatever is the practice, but they are extremely concerned about the implications over the past year and a half of the serious diminution of the awards in some cases.  They are coming to us asking for guidance and help in this regard.  I cannot believe that the Minister has not been the subject of the same representations.  Will he avoid giving us auld blarney about the 1998 Act?  Has he made representations to the Courts Service?  Are changes in prospect?  Will there be help for these families who find themselves beleaguered in the circumstances I have described?

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I thank the Minister of State for being present.  I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter.  I was prompted to bring forward the issue by a constituent who is a low-paid worker with four children, including twins under four.  My constituent was looking forward to availing of the free preschool year for her twin children beginning in September 2010.  She is now bitterly disappointed to find that, because those two children will not reach the age of three until July, they will not qualify for the preschool year in September.  She has been told that they would only be able to begin their preschool year in September 2011.  By that time, they will be of an age to attend primary school.  I have no doubt that this is not an isolated case.  The same flaw in the regulations must affect thousands of children.There is, and will be, widespread frustration with the manner in which the free preschool year in early childhood care and education has been established and implemented.  The rules, as currently laid down, discriminate against children who should qualify for this scheme and this is causing deep disappointment to their parents who expected to be able to avail of the scheme.  They have been refused places for this coming September because the rules of the scheme state that to qualify for places in September 2010, children must be born on or after 2 February 2006 or on or before 30 June 2007.  One can imagine the disappointment of their parents, both low-paid workers struggling to raise their children.  Their mother's plea to "please give me some incentive to go to work" speaks volumes.Clearly, children should automatically qualify for the free preschool year once they become three years of age and arrangements should be made to allow them to enrol.  Rolling enrolment is required.  In 2010 it was provided for that children could commence in January.  I urge that the same provision be made for 2011 and subsequent years.  It may be that some children will not be able to avail of a full year, but they should be able to avail of part of a year.This scheme cannot be compared to enrolment for the first year in primary school, which is the first of eight years of primary education.  The scheme in question is supposed to be a free preschool year, and children and parents must be allowed to avail of it when children are of preschool age.  In the case I have cited and many others like it, the children will not qualify for September 2010 and will only qualify for September 2011, by which time they will be starting primary school anyway.I tabled questions to Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, who is present in the House, on this matter.  I refer to Questions Nos. 271 and 272 of 20 October 2009.  However, I found the replies totally unsatisfactory and, in fact, contradictory.  How can it be claimed that the scheme is being operated "generously", as the Minister stated, when it excludes so many children who happen to be born in what I can only describe as gap months between the registration date and the commencement date?  Surely flexibility could be introduced into the system to allow children to start when they reach the age of three.  Even if they were not able to avail of the full year, they could avail of part of it, and this would still be of educational value to the children and of great assistance to their parents.  Again I ask, would it not be possible for children to begin in January 2011, just as they began in January 2010?

The problem will recur annually unless it is satisfactorily addressed.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I have responsibility for the implementation of the free preschool year in early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme which commenced in January of this year.The introduction of the ECCE scheme was announced in April 2009 as part of the supplementary budget.  A total of €170 million has been allocated to the scheme in 2010.  The scheme is open to application by all preschool services notified to the HSE or registered with the Irish Montessori Education Board, IMEB.  Approximately 4,000 preschool services, or some 85%, which met the criteria for the scheme are participating.  There is at present no statutory basis for the ECCE scheme.  The terms and conditions governing the scheme have been drawn up by my office on an administrative basis and are provided for in the contractual arrangements which govern the scheme.Preschool services are paid a capitation fee, generally at the rate of €2,450 per annum, in return for providing the free preschool year to qualifying children.  Services are required to provide appropriate programme-based activities for children in the qualifying age range.  The early learning programmes provided must adhere to the principles of Síolta, the national framework for early learning developed under the Department of Education and Science.  In addition, preschool leaders delivering the programmes and activities must hold minimum qualifications in early learning.  A higher capitation rate of €2,850 is available to preschool services with more highly qualified staff.All preschool services participating in the ECCE scheme were required to make a return to my office by 29 January 2010 giving details of the qualifying children enrolled and attending their services.  While this will determine the level of funding payable to the services, advance interim payments were issued in January 2010 to all services in contract and where bank details had been provided.  The returns are currently being processed by the child care directorate of my office, which administers the scheme.I was delighted to announce yesterday that more than 51,000 children are participating in the scheme.  This represents a very high take-up, particularly in the initial interim period in advance of the first full year of the scheme from September next.  It should also be noted that some 2,500 children who would qualify for the ECCE scheme are availing of their free community child care subvention scheme, CCSS, which is also implemented by my office.  The CCSS provides support funding to community child care services to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to disadvantaged and low-income parents.  Parents qualifying for the highest rate of subvention will in many cases receive a higher funding level under the CCSS and for this reason have opted to avail of the preschool year under the CCSS.  This means that the percentage of children availing of the free preschool year at this point is 85%.The ECCE scheme is a universal scheme and is open to all children when they fall within the qualifying age range.  To provide flexibility for parents and their children, the qualifying age range is three years and three months to four years and six months, measured in September each year.  This means that all children aged more than three years and two months and all children aged less than four years and seven months will qualify.  This allows for an age range of almost 17 months.  Children who were aged three years and two months or slightly younger in September 2009 will qualify for the preschool year in September 2010.  The upper age limit does not apply where children are developmentally delayed and would benefit from participating in the preschool year at a later age or where a particular issue arises with regard to school admissions policies.While the great majority of children commence school between the age of four years six months and five years six months, it is accepted that some parents choose to send their children to primary school at an earlier age.  The ECCE scheme allows for children to attend the preschool year and still commence primary school when they are just over four years and two months of age.  However, the objective of the scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the key developmental year before they commence primary school, with appropriate age-related activities and programmes being provided to children within a particular age cohort.  Targeting the preschool year at a particular age cohort is clearly fundamental to the scheme and it is necessary, therefore, to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will participate in the scheme each year.  I am satisfied that the age range set for the scheme achieves a reasonable balance between supporting the provision of appropriate age-related programmes and activities and providing flexibility to parents and their children, and I have no plans to review the position.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	588	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this matter.The right to feel safe in one's own home is a basic entitlement.  Article 40.5 of the Constitution states specifically: "The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law."  In recent years, a number of high-profile incidents have increased the focus on this subject, most recently the tragic death in Waterford of Mr. Paddy Barry, who died after an aggravated attack by a burglar in his home in Waterford.  There has been a perception, somewhat unfairly, that the law in this area comes down more on the side of the people who perpetrate these crimes rather than those on whom the crime is committed.  The Government is currently preparing legislation which will clarify this matter and ensure that homeowners are more confident in their right to defend their dwellings.I welcome this move and the stance the Minister has taken on the matter.  However, there should be greater deterrents for the people who commit these crimes, particularly against the elderly and vulnerable.  One such deterrent would be the introduction of mandatory sentences for burglary and aggravated burglary.  l am aware that there are two opposing views in this regard.  There are those who would say that mandatory sentencing will not solve the underlying problems that cause people to commit these crimes; however, it is my belief that the thought of going to prison for a set number of years will make many burglars think twice before they enter a property.According to recent CSO statistics, there were 26,783 burglaries and related offences last year — an increase of 8.5% — while the annual increase in aggravated burglary offences, compared with 2008, was 11.7%.  Statistics show that Dublin is the worst affected area, with 32.7% of all burglaries.  In my own constituency of Dublin South-East there has been a spate of burglaries recently in which elderly people are targeted in their homes.  The criminals prey on the trusting nature of these homeowners by posing as council officials or people on official business such as television licence inspectors.  While the Garda has been excellent in combating such crimes, providing people with checklists for home security and warning them not to trust anyone they do not know, it is an uphill battle due to the fact that many of the perpetrators serve only a few months in prison before being let out on the streets again.The Attorney General has asked the Law Reform Commission to consider the issue of mandatory sentencing, particularly for those who attack the vulnerable in our society.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said he is open-minded on the subject of mandatory sentences and has not ruled them out, but he queried the need for them in view of the fact that a maximum sentence could apply.  I had hoped to have the statistics of how many maximum sentences have been handed out; unfortunately, I am still awaiting that figure.  Although I could stand corrected, the handing out of maximum sentences is not the norm for burglaries.Finally, Age Action has pointed out that while older persons are less likely to be victims of crime compared to other age groups, they are three times more likely to fear for their well-being in their own area than younger people.  It is simply not good enough to have our elderly people living in fear and I would strongly support the implementation of mandatory sentencing for those who perpetrate these crimes on the vulnerable in society.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	589	The Government is aware that there has been widespread public debate and comment in recent months on the issue of mandatory sentencing, particularly in the context of burglaries and unlawful intrusions into the family home.  Both my colleague, the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, and the Garda Commissioner are concerned at the increase in property theft shown in the figures released by the Central Statistics Office for the fourth quarter of 2009.Vulnerable people, particularly the elderly, are subject to unwelcome callers to their homes.  All of us must be vigilant but it is also imperative that the State does all in its power to support and help those who need our protection.  We are of course particularly concerned at criminals preying on the elderly in our community.  The Garda Síochána is committed to providing a visible presence at local level throughout the country.  The number of gardaí assigned as dedicated community gardaí has increased from 709 at the end of December 2008 to 1,058 just one year later; an increase of almost 50%.A community policing ethos drives the work of the gardaí and a great deal of community based initiatives have been undertaken in recent years.  For example, community alert, which was set up by Muintir na Tíre in association with the Garda Síochána in 1985, is now a national movement comprising more than 1,300 local groups dedicated to improving the quality of life of vulnerable people in rural Ireland, particularly the elderly.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides financial support to community alert.Neighbourhood Watch, which operates mostly in urban areas, was established by the gardaí to enlist the voluntary help of the community.  It promotes community participation and good citizenship to ensure that sections of our communities do not become marginalised.  The programme fosters the best kind of community spirit, where neighbours look out for each other.  Neighbourhood Watch is administered through the Garda community relations division.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs provides grant support for community and voluntary organisations to address the isolation and security needs of older people.  This scheme has enabled the installation of monitored alert systems since 1996.  We estimate that as many as 90,000 older people are monitored on a 24 hour, seven day basis.With regard to the commission of burglary offences, the Minister is very much aware that some people could feel that mandatory sentencing for burglary might have a deterrent effect on those contemplating committing this offence.In the first instance It should be pointed out that the Government has taken seriously the public comments on this question and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has written to the Attorney General on the matter.  I understand that the Attorney General has made a formal request to the Law Reform Commission, as provided for in the Law Reform Commission Act 1975, requesting an examination of the issue of mandatory sentencing generally.  The Minister has also been informed that this examination will be undertaken by the Law Reform Commission during the current year.Current penalties for burglary and for aggravated burglary, as set out in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, are severe by any standards.  A person who is convicted on indictment of the offence of burglary is liable to a fine or to a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years.  A conviction for aggravated burglary, where the perpetrator is carrying a weapon of offence such as any item with a blade or a sharp point and including a firearm, an imitation firearm or explosives, carries a sentence of life imprisonment.  The House will be aware that there can be no higher penalty under Irish law.  There are, therefore, already very severe penalties for this kind of offence.There are few more important issues than the necessity for people to be safe in their own homes.  This is a matter of considerable concern to the Government and to the gardaí.  There is a determination on the part of Government to ensure that every possible aspect of this issue is examined.  All of the resources available to us will be utilised in trying to improve the position of those who feel vulnerable or under threat in their homes.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	590	Without wishing to be disrespectful to the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, I regret that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has not taken the trouble to come into the House to address this matter.On 25 January, the members of Wicklow County Council held a special meeting to discuss a motion calling on the Minister to instigate a public inquiry in the performance of the council in the granting of a waste licence relating to a borrow pit on lands belonging to the Byrne family of Ballybeg, near Rathnew, County Wicklow.  The motion was overwhelming supported and the request has been forwarded to this Minister for Environment who has the statutory authority to instigate such a public enquiry.I am asking him in the interest of the public good and of the county council itself that this be done without delay.  While the events took place some time ago, no appropriate inquiry has ever been held despite the fact that the Byrne family were clearly not treated properly and were put at risk of losing a contract worth almost €0.5 million.The Byrne family had a contractual arrangement with the Morris Sisk Consortium that was subject to the granting of a waste licence on the land.  The council granted the licence.  Subsequently, that licence was shredded and its existence denied.  However, the Byrne family discovered that a copy of the licence had been lodged with the EPA.  As a consequence, Councillor George Jones of Fine Gael made a strong case on their behalf and the licence was ultimately granted.  Ever since the circumstances of the events have been the subject of controversy.Councillor Jones sought an inquiry by writing to Deputy Martin Cullen, the then Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and then to Deputy Dick Roche, who took over that position.  Inexplicably, Deputy Roche gave the task of investigation to the Local Government Audit Service, a body clearly not equipped in law to carry out the indepth inquiry into the events.  Indeed, in his letter to Councillor Jones, he pointed out that the Local Government Financial Provisions Act 1997 does not allow for the public or members to make submissions to such a process.To this day Councillor Jones has never been interviewed although his was a pivotal role in ensuring that the Byrne family were treated properly, albeit belatedly, by Wicklow County Council.  He pursued every avenue open to him without satisfaction.  The point has been made by him and other public representatives that not only should the performance of Wicklow County Council be investigated but so too should there be scrutiny of the role of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government under two different Ministers, Deputies Cullen and Roche.Councillor Jones wrote to the co-manager with a series of questions to be answered.  He wrote that the whole saga "has very serious implications in our service and treatment of our customers/public; the Council's relationship with private contractors and a lack of accountability to elected members."  To dismiss the events as simply an administrative error is totally inadequate when set against the shredding of documents, the failure to hold onto background information and lack of accountability that characterises this issue to this day.I urge the Minister of State to talk to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, since we will not be able to do so, and impress on him the importance of a proper public inquiry.  The Minister is very quick to criticise councils he does not agree with.  In this instance he is being asked by members of a council to investigate the record and he has a duty to follow up on that request.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	591	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government received the text of a resolution adopted by Wicklow County Council that calls on him to hold a local public inquiry concerning the issuing of a waste permit for certain lands at Ballybeg, County Wicklow.  The Minister wants to make clear how seriously he takes any matters relating to illegal dumping of waste and, in this context, he considers it important to place on the record of the House some of the actions which have been taken in this regard.Considerable progress has been made by the relevant statutory agencies in dealing with illegal waste activity.  In particular, since the establishment of the Office of Environmental Enforcement in 2003, enforcement has been better structured through the establishment of a national enforcement network.  The OEE and the enforcement network have greatly raised awareness and brought about better practice and a more co-ordinated and consistent approach to environmental enforcement by the relevant authorities.  Annual supporting funding from the Department's environment fund of over €7.5 million has led to some 120 additional local authority enforcement personnel and a greatly enhanced response on the ground.In October 2005, the OEE published a major study, "The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland", which concluded that large-scale illegal dumping is no longer occurring but local authorities now have to cope with problems such as fly-tipping and backyard burning.  Two ministerial policy directions issued in May 2005 and July 2008 provided guidance where illegal deposition is discovered.  The policy direction issued in 2005 sets the standard in terms of the expected response from the regulatory authorities, which are obliged to ensure that the necessary remedial measures will be taken to ensure that sites are restored and that waste illegally deposited is appropriately disposed of or recovered.  The 2008 direction deals with the use of sanctions to ensure effective actions against those involved in unauthorised waste activities.On the criminal side, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations has been involved in the context of the illegal dumping of waste in County Wicklow and criminal proceedings have occurred.  These proceedings have resulted in a fine of €150,000 in one case and a six-month prison sentence in another.Regarding the Ballybeg case, the Minister has arranged for all departmental records recently released under the Access to Information on the Environment Regulations 2007 to be furnished to the cathaoirleach of Wicklow County Council with the strong recommendation that they be circulated to all members of the council without delay.  He will also be arranging for them to be forwarded to all Oireachtas Members for County Wicklow.  The Minister assures the House that the request from Wicklow County Council for an inquiry will be examined carefully.  Such examination will, inter alia, take into account the study carried out by the Local Government Audit Service in 2005.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important that we approach the issue in a way that is systematic, fair and proportionate.

It is not acceptable and I hope the Dáil reform committee will deal with such situations so that when questions are put to Ministers, they or their juniors would be present.

Planning was done in two phases and matters in the planning files indicate confusion as to the nature and extent of the drainage required.  While the developer complied with some parts of the requirements, he is also the subject of enforcement notices from the local authority and others.The Waterways flooding has notable aspects, one being that it was entirely avoidable.  The flood was not caused by a large river breaking its banks or by virtue of the estate being built on a flood plain.  It was caused by an inadequate and partly blocked culvert.  The flooding of houses up to a depth of 4 ft. lasted from the morning of Sunday, 21 November until the evening of Tuesday, 1 December.  A blocked culvert under the road was identified as the cause.  However, despite the fact that the problem was identified at an early stage, it became almost impossible to get the necessary work sanctioned to clear the culvert.  The local authority claimed it was the business of the management company, which claimed that it could not deal with the matter because the culvert was outside the estate.  Eventually at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, 1 December, the local authority gave permission to have the road opened and the culvert cleared.  In a few hours, the flood water had subsided and it was gone within 12 hours.The residents — owners and tenants — were left with a massive task in trying to rescue what remained of their properties.  Work is now under way to install adequate drainage systems that will ensure no recurrence of such a disaster.  I am raising this matter because it is important to the residents that, when the remedial work is complete, their insurance companies are assured that no such flooding will recur.  I am satisfied that this is the case, as the works currently under way will be effective in preventing future flooding.I refer to the interview given by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, on "Prime Time" on RTE on Monday, 4 January.  I do not do this in a hostile sense.  During his interview, the Minister stated that it was not called Waterways for nothing, in that it was built on a flood plain.  Whatever the Minister might believe concerning the estate's name, he was wrong to state that it is built on a flood plain.  I am not suggesting that he did this in a malicious way, but it is most important for the residents and their ability to get insurance against future flooding, if any, that his statement about a flood plain be corrected.My colleague, Deputy Bernard Durkan, and I have already raised this issue by means of parliamentary questions without a satisfactory response.  Indeed, our questions were ignored.  When the OPW, the Government's expert on flooding, was questioned on this point, it stated that the area was subject to flooding — we knew this, seeing as how it was flooded — but certainly did not state that it was a flood plain.I ask the Minister of State to correct the record specifically to ensure that the earlier statement is not used by insurance companies to increase premiums or refuse insurance.  I am hopeful that he will take this opportunity to do so.  Sallins in County Kildare is a highly desirable location in which to live, work and raise a family.  The Waterways estate is a very desirable location within Sallins and its residents deserve our best efforts to restore the area's reputation.  The Minister might not even know we are here, but I hope that the Minister of State will ask him about this matter directly.  I am not suggesting that the Minister commented maliciously.  It was an off-the-top-of-the-head remark, but one that is causing serious difficulties for residents and needs to be corrected.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	595	Recent experience has highlighted the need to develop a deeper understanding of flood risk, how we manage and reduce that risk and how we deal with the effects of significant flood events.  A sound planning approach is central in avoiding and reducing flood risk by integrating the consideration of flooding potential into the planning process, first, through the spatial planning process at regional, city and county and local levels, and also in the assessment of development proposals by planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála.The recent flooding events sharply illustrate the questionable nature of some development decisions in the past and underline the necessity for action to avoid such developments in locations in which future flooding is predictable.  In this regard, the guidelines for planning authorities on the planning system and flood risk management, which were jointly published by the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, last November, introduce a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system.  These guidelines provide, inter alia, that development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly flood plains, should be avoided unless there are wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level.The guidelines require the planning system at national, regional and local levels to avoid development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly in flood plains, unless there are proven wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the flood risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level without increasing flood risk elsewhere; adopt a sequential approach to flood risk management when assessing the location for new development based on avoidance, reduction and mitigation of flood risk; and incorporate flood risk assessment into the process of making decisions on planning applications and planning appeals.  It is likely that some lands will have been zoned for development in existing or previous plans without the benefit of a detailed flood risk assessment in accordance with these guidelines and in the absence of detailed flood risk mapping, which is now being carried out by the OPW.  Where a review of a development or local area plan shows that there may be a flood risk on certain zoned lands, such zonings must be reconsidered.The guidelines define a flood plain as any low-lying area of land next to a river or stream that is susceptible to partial or complete inundation by water during a flood event.  While strict application of this definition to the land on which the Waterways estate in Sallins was built may be a matter of interpretation, the fact remains that a development that otherwise complied with proper planning and sustainable development was inundated by water following unprecedented recent rainfall.  The Minister understands that, in conjunction with Irish Rail, Waterways Ireland and the OPW, Kildare County Council has identified the scope of remedial works necessary to minimise the likelihood of recurrence of flooding in this area.  These works are ongoing and should be completed in the coming weeks.It is important that planning authorities and all other key stakeholders apply the principles and practices for flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system in line with the guidelines.  In the context of the Minister's statutory role in the planning process, he will continue to assess development and local area plans to monitor implementation of these principles at local level to ensure that future development takes account of these policies.

Tipperary and in Tallaght, Dublin 24 which are funded by my Department, through the Probation Service and which operate on the principles of restorative justice with the twin aim of attempting to heal the harm done to victims and at the same time holding the offender accountable for his or her actions.In the case of juveniles, restorative justice was introduced on a statutory basis for the first time in the Children Act 2001.  There are two restorative justice initiatives provided for in the Act: A restorative conference or restorative caution included in the Garda Diversion Programme and a court-ordered restorative justice family conference delivered through the Probation Service.The Garda Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and, at all times, it pays the highest regard to the needs of the victims.  The programme has proven to be successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to the young people and their families.  This programme operates nationwide.Family conferencing administered by the Probation Service at the request of the Courts under Sections 78-87 of the Children Act 2001 is another restorative practice and is available on a national basis.  A family conference is based on the principles of restorative justice.  The aim of the family conference is to divert the young person, who has accepted responsibility for his or her behaviour, from Court, from conviction and custody and from committing further offences.As the Deputy will be aware a National Commission on Restorative Justice chaired by Judge Mary Martin was asked to look at this whole area.  The final report of the Commission was published on 17 December, 2009.  Comprehensive information on the operation of Restorative Justice in this jurisdiction is contained in Chapter 3 of the Report.  The report and its recommendations are currently being examined by my Department having regard to resource and funding implications and against the background of the range of other non-custodial measures available to the courts.  I will be bringing my proposals to Government in due course.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	603	Information on sanctions imposed by the courts on young offenders is published each year in the Annual Report of the Courts Service. These reports are available on the Courts Service website, www.courts.ie and in the Oireachtas Library. The most recent such report is in respect of the year 2008.  Related information is also available in the Probation Service Annual Report, the most recent of which is also in respect of the year 2008. This report is available on the Probation Service website, www.probation.ie and also in the Oireachtas Library.I am informed, however, that the two services do not currently collect data to the level of detail requested by the Deputy. I should point out that one of the objectives of the National Youth Justice Strategy is to improve and increase the availability of reliable and relevant data on youth crime. My office is working with the Irish Youth Justice Service and other key stakeholders to achieve this objective.While detailed information is not readily available, I am informed that the majority of probation orders made by the courts are conditional orders under Section 115(c) of the Children Act 2001. These are linked to the probation order available under the Probation Act 1907. However, it is important to note that the conditions generally imposed by the courts reflect to a large extent the wide spread of community sanctions available to the courts, including mentoring, training, activities and day centre conditions.The Young Persons Probation Division of the Probation Service was extended in 2008 to provide a national service from bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Drogheda and Sligo. This has allowed for community sanctions to be made available nationwide.I do believe that the use of these alternatives to custody are having an impact. The Courts Service Annual Report for 2008 shows that the proportion of court orders involving the detention of children has dropped from 20% of court orders in 2007 to 16% in 2008. This is welcome news and I look forward to the publication of data for 2009, which, I hope, will reflect further improvement.

They include enabling powers for the courts to order attachment of the earnings of a debtor spouse, to order the securing of payments to the maintenance creditor, to order the payment of lump sums and to order arrears of maintenance to be paid by instalments.While the law generally operates successfully in this area I am aware that difficulties have arisen in some cases because of the effect of a judgment of the High Court last year. The High Court judgement in that particular case had implications for sections 6 (imprisonment in the case of non-payment of debt) and 8 (imprisonment relating to non-payment of maintenance) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940. The Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 made changes in the law consequent on that judgment.  Whilst the particular judgment only referred to section 6, the legal advice was that section 8 should also be amended since it was constructed in a very similar way.  The need to establish the debtor's ability to pay has changed the basis on which the enforcement system previously operated — particularly in maintenance cases.I am in consultation with the Attorney General with a view to developing early proposals for legislation to resolve the difficulties that have arisen in respect of maintenance enforcement.

Because of the complexities involved, it is likely that any new system would initially be introduced on a pilot basis to allow all the operational and legal aspects to be fully tested and evaluated.

While the purchase of gold is not specifically regulated, the circumstances under which gold is being bought or sold may indicate the commission of certain offences, for example the handling of stolen property and or the possession of stolen property, which are offences under sections 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 respectively.

As I have indicated, the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Detective Chief Superintendent to inquire into all the circumstances surrounding the incident.  That inquiry is ongoing and a report is awaited.  Until that report is available, it is not possible to say for definite how the error occurred in Slovakia and what actions were taken by the authorities there when the error was discovered.  When the report is completed I will consider what further action, if any, is required on my part.

Working to fulfil the commitments contained in the Policy and Strategy involves the implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners' treatment and rehabilitative needs.

The Act allows for the application of reasonable force by a person, (whether the attack occurs in the home or elsewhere), to defend themselves, others or property.  A court or a jury in considering whether such force was reasonable in the circumstances must do so on the basis of the level of force the person responding to an attack considered was reasonable at that time.The Court of Criminal Appeal has made the common law position on the question of an appropriate response to an attack in the home very clear in the judgement of DPP  v  Barnes  [2006] IECCA 165.  The judgment in that case included the following statements:"every burglary in a dwelling house is an act of aggression.......it is quite inconsistent with the doctrine of the inviolability of the dwelling house that a householder or other lawful occupier could ever be under a lawful obligation to flee the dwelling house. . . . . it follows from this in turn that such a person can never be in a worse position on point of law because he has decided to stand his ground in his house."The Court stated that any intruder entering a home dwelling with criminal intent could expect to be met with a vigorous defence from the occupier.While the common law position is as set out in the Barnes judgment and the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 already provides protection for those who may resort to self defence in the face of an attack irrespective of the location, there is no statutory legislative provision dealing with the question of attacks specifically in the context of the home dwelling or the immediate vicinity of the dwelling. The Government had approved the Heads of a Bill dealing with this aspect of the law in 2007. The Bill was not progressed at that time as the Law Reform Commission (LRC) was in the course of a detailed examination of the issue of defences generally in the criminal law. This examination is now completed and the LRC published a Report on the matter in December 2009. Since then a General Scheme of a new Bill has been prepared in my Department and has been circulated to other Departments for their observations. I expect it to be in a position to bring forward proposals for a Bill on the topic of defence and the home dwelling to Government in the coming weeks and subject to Government approval it is my intention to have this proposed Bill introduced in the Oireachtas as soon as possible.

Internal email facilities are provided to all ranks within An Garda Síochána via the PULSE environment.  External Email facilities are also provided to all Gardaí from the rank of Inspector upwards and have to date been made available to members of other ranks and civilian staff based on operational needs identified by Garda management.I welcome the recent Garda Inspectorate Report on Resource Allocation.

This decision was deemed by the Supreme Court to be compatible with the existing test for leave to take judicial review proceedings known as the O’Keefe test. At present my officials are engaged in consultations with the legal team who represented the State’s interests in this case in order to clarify the implications of the decision for the asylum/immigration work areas of my Department. It is too early to say what, if any legislative or administrative measures will be required arising from the judgment.

It is worth noting, however, that the number of Gardaí exclusively assigned to community policing has increased considerably in recent times.  The figures available at the end of 2009 show that there are 1,058 members of the Garda Síochána specifically assigned to community policing, out of a total attested strength of 14,547.  By comparison, at the end of 2007, 630 members were assigned to community policing, and the present number represents an increase of almost 68% on that figure.All members who are assigned to community policing operate on a full-time basis. These members are specifically tasked with the duty of liaising with communities within their policing Districts. The new Garda Síochána National Model of Community Policing was launched early in 2009. This new model is about renewing, re-invigorating and re-structuring  the community policing function within the Garda Síochána to deliver:— a consistent national structure to the community policing function; a  more coordinated and efficient Garda service to the community; and the spread of good practices and quality service in community policing on a national basis. The national strategies for Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, both of which were launched in 2007, will also inform the organisation on how best to implement future crime prevention programmes and community policing programmes.A National Community Policing Office has been established within Garda Community Relations Section to develop and oversee the implementation programme. The model is being rolled out nationwide in line with an action plan which has been developed for implementation. Training is ongoing and it is intended that every District Officer throughout the country will take ownership of community policing within his or her area of responsibility. The Garda Síochána National Model of Community Policing Report is available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.

Working closely with the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the IYJS is guided by the principles of the Children Act 2001. The IYJS funds organisations and projects providing services, including Garda and Probation Projects, to young people aged 12 to 17 years of age who find themselves in conflict with the law. These children may be involved with An Garda Síochána, the Probation Service and the Courts Service.  The IYJS is also responsible for the management and development of children detention facilities.The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the primary purpose of which is to introduce additional measures targeted at combating organised crime, will interact with the youth justice system in the same way as other criminal legislation.  The priority, of course, is to intervene in offending behaviour by young people before it develops into the type of criminal behaviour at which the legislation in question is aimed.

The Tribunal was established by the Oireachtas in May 2005 arising from the Weston Park Agreement between the Irish and British Governments in 2001.  The Tribunal is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick.  The Tribunal Chairman is independent in his functions in accordance with the provisions of the Act.The Tribunal is in an investigative phase at present.  Although it is not possible to indicate a completion date at this point, I have no doubt that the Tribunal's Chairman is fully cognisant of the need for the Tribunal to fulfil its mandate as expeditiously as possible.

Due to the covert nature of the activity, it is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the proportion of drugs coming into the country that these figures represent. Through ongoing specific initiatives and intelligence-led operations An Garda Síochána continues to seize substantial quantities of illegal drugs destined for the streets in this jurisdiction and disrupting those criminals involved in the importation, distribution, sale and supply of illegal drugs in Ireland.Drugs and organised crime are being prioritised by An Garda Síochána as a core focus for 2010, through the Commissioner's Policing Plan, 2010, which reflects Government strategies contained in the National Drug Strategy.  Drugs units are in place in every Garda division and work in partnership with the Garda National Drugs Unit in tackling and targeting drug-related crime. Divisional and District Policing Plans also reflect the focus of the national Policing Plan in terms of drugs enforcement.As part of a co-ordinated approach. An Garda Síochána makes full use of the international Garda Liaison Network, District and Divisional Drug Units, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau, as well as other specialist units and uniformed and plain-clothes personnel nationwide, in targeting drug supply reduction.  An Garda Síochána also has in place a number of strategic partnerships at national and international level to address drug trafficking.I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána is satisfied that, in addition to the considerable volume of drugs continuing to be seized, a significant impact has also been made by arresting and prosecuting a number of major players involved in drug trafficking.  Gangs and other organised criminal groupings involved in drug-trafficking into Ireland have also been significantly disrupted and dismantled through the ongoing enforcement policies of An Garda Síochána.  Recent and ongoing initiatives include:The operation of the Organised Crime Unit on a permanent capacity,Ongoing Irish involvement in the work of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre in Lisbon,The recent publication of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill that will see the establishment, for the first time, of a national DNA database in Ireland,The ongoing development and support by CAB of the Divisional Asset Profiler's Programme.Furthermore, as the Deputy will know, I have in recent times introduced an extensive suite of criminal justice legislation targeted at those engaged in serious crime (including drug trafficking) including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act and the  Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.However, it is clear that we cannot tackle the problem of drug misuse through law enforcement measures alone. As set out in the Government's new National Drugs Strategy for the period  2009 to 2016, it is vital to address the problem in a co-ordinated way across the pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  In this context, I can assure the House that my Department, and all the agencies under its aegis, remain fully committed to this approach and to the implementation of the Strategy.The Garda authorities advise that the following tables show the quantities of drugs seized in 2007, 2008 and 2009 on the basis of cases reported to the Forensic Science Laboratory (valid to 29 January 2010).

Their purpose is to provide a forum where An Garda Síochána and the local authority — the two organisations which make the most significant contribution to preventing and tackling crime in a specific area — can come together, with the participation of members of the Oireachtas and community and voluntary interests, on matters affecting their area.  The Committees are a partnership process which aims to improve the coordination between agencies and the quality of communications between all concerned.Local Policing Fora are also established under the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  These are intended to operate in a more informal way than the Joint Policing Committees and are intended to deepen the engagement between Gardaí, the local authority and neighbourhood communities.   I have issued guidelines on the operation of the Fora in those areas where Local Drug Task Forces operate.The work of the Joint Policing Committees and the Local Policing Fora does not entail additional functions for the agencies involved.  Each agency involved is generally expected to meet the expenses arising for itself in establishing and operating the Committees and Fora from within its own budget.

To support this initiative, a computerised information system has been developed to provide information on sentences and other penalties imposed for offences in criminal proceedings which may inform judges when considering the sentence to be imposed in an individual case.A number of pilot projects have been run in several court jurisdictions, including Dublin, Cork and Limerick Circuit Criminal Courts; the Dublin District Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The outcomes will be reviewed and assessed by judges prior to final evaluation and establishment of the website.  I understand it is envisaged that, in addition to the case content, which is being compiled following consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner, the website will contain references to leading cases on sentencing, summaries and links to significant judgements on sentencing law, some statistical data and academic material on sentencing.

The aim is to provide good quality, regime focussed prison accommodation with appropriate support and rehabilitative facilities for prisoners to prepare them for re-integration back into society.The development is now proceeding on a phased basis with phase one comprising essential enabling works including the construction of the dedicated access road, perimeter wall and off-site services. Tenders for the construction of the access road are planned to issue in March/April of this year.  A tender competition for the construction of the perimeter wall of the prison is planned to issue during the Summer of this year.An EU wide tender competition for the appointment of technical advisors to the Irish Prison Service is already in progress. The Irish Prison Service is being assisted in this process by the National Development Finance Agency. In addition the National Development Finance Agency, on behalf of the Irish Prison Service, commenced a tender competition for legal advisers for the project on 19 January 2010.It is intended to invite tenders for the construction of the main prison development later this year.  All options have to be considered in the context of the detailed capital appraisal of the project.  The idea of a multiplicity of smaller institutions on different sites around the Dublin area is simply far less practical than the proposals for a campus arrangement at Thornton.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 45 and 50 together.When I received the report of the Commission of Investigation on the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin last July, I immediately sent it to the Garda Commissioner and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Since then, I have discussed the matter with the Commissioner.  A number of the perpetrators discussed in the report have already been brought to justice, proceedings are pending against others and a number of investigations are ongoing.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that pursuing the perpetrators, whenever the abuse occurred, is an absolute priority for An Garda Síochána.The Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney to examine the report's findings relating to the handling of complaints and investigations by both Church and State authorities, to carry out such investigations and inquiries as he deems appropriate and to make a report to him with his recommendations.  The Commissioner will then consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions as to what issues arise in the context of criminal liability.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, while it is at this stage too early to give a precise date for the completion of the Assistant Commissioner's investigation, the Commissioner has directed that it be concluded as early as possible.The findings of the Commission's report are positive with regard to the current Garda arrangements for dealing with such allegations.  Nevertheless, after consulting with the Garda Commissioner, I have asked the Garda Inspectorate to review the Garda handling of allegations of child sexual abuse.The Government requested the Commission of Investigation in early 2009 to extend its work to deal with the Catholic Diocese of Cloyne because of concerns which had arisen in relation to that diocese.  I believe that the work of the Commission in relation to the Archdiocese of Dublin and the Diocese of Cloyne will serve the purpose of establishing how child sexual abuse cases were dealt with by the Church and State authorities so that lessons can be learned and remedies introduced.I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs that the Health Service Executive (HSE) is currently in the process of completing its audit of Catholic dioceses to ensure that it, as the statutorily responsible body, is fully aware of all cases of clerical child sex abuse known to the Church.  A detailed questionnaire issued to each diocese and completed replies were received by the HSE from the head of each diocese.  A number of dioceses asked to re-submit their questionnaire responses and those requests were assented to.  The HSE also sought additional information with a view to checking this information against internal and Garda Síochána records.  These actions have of necessity entailed a delay in the process, but with the expectation that it will improve outcomes.  It is expected that the HSE will submit a comprehensive report to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs by the end of February for his consideration.Work is well under way on preparing legislation to provide a statutory framework for the sharing of soft information.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is preparing Heads of a Bill in consultation with my Department,  An Garda Síochána and the HSE.  The findings of the Commission's report about collection and sharing of information will be taken fully into account in that process which will be completed in the very near future.

Since 1997 in excess of 1,670 new prison spaces have been provided. In addition, current projects will see a further 250 spaces provided by means of a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will accommodate approximately 200 prisoners and the re-opening of the Separation Unit in Mountjoy which will provide an additional 50 spaces.  This extensive prison building programme speaks for itself.In addition, work is expected to commence this year on a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prison complex which will provide 300 prison spaces.  In the longer term, the Government remains firmly committed to replacing the prisons on the Mountjoy complex with modern prison accommodation at Thornton.

The study relates to the attrition of rape cases, that is, the lack of progress on to completion of criminal cases, and more specifically, to the stages at which cases drop out from the criminal justice system, that is, from the initial report stage to the final stage of court proceedings. It should be noted that cases may not be progressed through the system due, for example, to insufficiency of evidence. Over the past 18 months or so the main priority of Cosc — The National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, has been the development of a National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence for the five-year period from 2010 to 2014.  I can inform the Deputy that the issue of attrition of rape cases was raised, and has been considered in the context of the development of the National Strategy. The Strategy is close to completion and will be considered by Government shortly.

The Board's services are provided to clients through a network of thirty three law centres, including the Refugee Legal service (RSL), located throughout the country.  This network is complemented by the use of private solicitors as required.Demand and priority serviceThe Board strives to ensure that an applicant will be provided with an appointment with a solicitor by the earliest possible date.  However, the Board's capacity to maintain front-line services at an acceptable level is under pressure, particularly in the context of significantly increased demand for services in the law centre network, excluding the RLS.  Applications at law centres in 2009 were 18% ahead of demand in 2008; 38% ahead of 2007; and 45% more than in 2006.There were almost 14,200 applications in 2009 as compared with some 11,900 in 2008, an increase of 1,300.  Nevertheless, approximately 40% of applicants for general legal services were given a service promptly, whether through law centres (about 15%) or by having their case referred to the Board's private practitioner service.Waiting times and numbersThe numbers of persons on the waiting lists on 1st January 2008, 2009 and this year were as follows:1st January 20081st January 20091st January 20101,1831,6812,228The waiting times in the Board's law centres at the beginning of the year and the end of the year were as follows:Number of months1 Jan 200931 Dec 20090-1321-2622-31193-4564-5345-6136-7017-8018-901In spite of this growth in demand, in only three of the 29 Law Centres is the waiting time seven months or longer.  These centres are Tipperary (seven months), Wicklow (8 months) and Wexford (9 months).  The number of cases referred to private practitioners under the private practitioner service for District Court cases was just over 3,900 in 2009 as compared with 2,850 in 2008.Staff and other resourcesThe geographically dispersed nature of the legal aid service means that the scope for redeployment of staff resources is extremely limited, outside of the Dublin area and, to a lesser extent, in Cork and Galway.  As a result, notwithstanding the efforts being made to reconfigure how the Board provides services and to deploy resources wherever possible to meet priority demands, there are a number of locations where there are acute service delivery problems.  While the primary driving force behind increased waiting times and numbers is the increase in demand for legal services, the moratorium on the filling of staff vacancies also means that the Board must devise new and innovative ways of ensuring that it can meet the demands placed upon it in the current challenging environment.Initiatives to meet increased demandThe Board has taken a number of steps in recent years to ensure that it is operating to the highest possible levels of effectiveness and efficiency.  For example, the Board has undertaken a complete review of both its law centre and Head Office operations, as well as a risk management review and has, as a result, streamlined its operations to improve efficiency.In addition, the Board has introduced a number of key changes and new initiatives to its systems and structures which are designed to improve the level of service being offered to its clients.   One such initiative is the introduction of an "Advice Only Service" under which clients will be offered an early appointment with a solicitor to discuss their situation on an advice only basis.  This has been introduced initially for law centres where applicants for legal services might have to wait for four months for an appointment with a law centre for services.  The medium and longer term focus of this service is the timely provision of legal advice to all applicants.A second initiative is the establishment of a "Model Law Centre" in Dublin, which is being utilised to develop best practice standards and to introduce further initiatives across the Board, including the development of new IT systems.  By improving efficiency in the manner in which the Board provides legal services, it is expected that the capacity of the Board will be increased and that more applicants will be provided with a timely service.The Board is seeking to take every step possible to ensure that applicants for its services will receive a timely service and in this regard all arrangements for delivery by the Board of legal aid and advice in the current difficult economic climate are under consideration.  In particular, consideration is now being given to the extent to which it might be possible to extend the scope of the private practitioner service to increase the availability of legal aid and advice services and to provide for greater flexibility in responding to particular pressure points in law centres.

The Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements under its Part 2.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State, including from Northern Ireland.An Garda Síochána has a system in place for the monitoring of all persons subject to these requirements.  The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit monitors and manages the notification provisions.  The Unit maintains all information relating to persons who have obligations under the Act.  There is a nominated Garda Inspector in each Garda Division who has responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Act in their Division.  As soon as the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit is advised by a relevant authority, such as the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service or a foreign law enforcement agency, of the impending release or movement of sex offenders into their area this information is immediately passed to the nominated Inspectors, who are advised of information relevant to their Division.An Garda Síochána and the PSNI maintain close contact and exchange intelligence on convicted sex offenders.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the Irish and British Governments in 2006 on the sharing between the Gardaí and British police forces, including the PSNI, of information on sex offenders.  An Garda Síochána and the PSNI subsequently signed an agreement on the sharing of personal data in relation to the investigation of sexual offences and the monitoring of sex offenders.A High Level Group set up by my Department and involving An Garda Síochána, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service and the HSE is examining the arrangements in place for the management of sex offenders with a view to strengthening inter-agency co-operation and further enhancing public protection and safety.  The group's remit includes a review of the procedures and legislation relating to the assessment, monitoring and supervision of convicted sex offenders.I am currently reviewing the criminal law on sexual offences, including the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  The review is taking into account the relevant legislative provisions in force in Northern Ireland.  Should the need for changes to the law in this area be identified, I will bring proposals to Government seeking approval for the preparation of appropriate amendments to the legislation.

Louth in October 2009 resulted in the seizure of contraband cigarettes with an estimated value of €46.7 million.  This operation was led by the Customs Service and was fully supported by An Garda Síochána, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Irish Naval Service and the Air Corps.  In addition, officers from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Police Service of Northern Ireland were also present.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the seizure resulted in nine arrests.  Following interviews, all of the persons arrested were released without charge, pending the completion of an investigation file by the Revenue Commissioners.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the investigation in this case is continuing, and consequently, a file has not yet been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.   The investigation is being carried out by Revenue Investigators and also involves Investigators from the European Anti Fraud Office (OLAF) who are co-ordinating investigations abroad with the relevant authorities in the Philippines. In this regard, a team involving officers from Revenue and OLAF have already visited the Philippines where they instigated the gathering of the necessary information.I am further informed that the vessel involved in the incident was released on 6 November 2009 after it was established that the owners of the vessel, and the company to whom it had been first leased, were not involved in the activities in question.

In addition, in 2006 a major capital injection was made with the purchase of over 1,300 new vehicles. This prudent investment has enabled both the expansion of the fleet as well as lowering its age profile with consequent benefits to Garda members in terms of health and safety and lower maintenance costs. Since September 2006 the size of the fleet has increased by approximately 25% with some 70% of vehicles under 4 years old.

Dublin.  The Office of Public Works has been charged with designing the new facilities and managing the procurement of the construction stage of the project.  The design stage is well advanced with both concept and sketch designs having been completed. Consultation with the planning authorities to determine the appropriate planning mechanism to be used is now underway and work will commence shortly on developing detailed designs in consultation with the various stakeholders so that Request for Tenders documentation for construction can be prepared.The completion date for the new facilities will be subject to the planning process to be followed but it is hoped, subject to any requirements that the planning authorities may have, that Phase 1 could be completed by mid-2013.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that tendering for the construction of the new facilities will be subject to Government approval and to the necessary funding being made available.

I refer the Deputy to my press release on Budget Day in relation to the Estimates and response to Parliamentary Question (Ref 46162/09) on 10th December, 2009 in relation to this matter.The Revised Estimates Volume is scheduled for publication later this month.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	643	Witness intimidation is an offence pursuant to Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, which specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by the Garda Síochána, with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.  Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the offence is now punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to 15 years.Since 1997 the Garda Síochána has operated a Witness Security Programme in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic witness intimidation.  Legislation was not required to establish this Programme, but its operation is supported by Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 which makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the Programme.  The offence is punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.The Garda Síochána rigorously enforces the provisions in the law relating to witness intimidation and protection.  In circumstances where the Senior Investigation Officer in a case has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be preferred is not available elsewhere, and there is a serious threat to the life of the witness or his/her family an application can be made, with the consent of the witness, to have him/her included in the Witness Security Programme.  Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge, who has discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused/suspect.It is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest, for self-evident reasons, to give details of the operation of the Witness Security Programme, including any information on the persons or numbers of persons included in it or their geographical locations.  A high level of confidentiality is essential to protect the individuals who may be involved in the programme and the operation of the programme.In addition to the legislative provisions I have already outlined, section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 allows a Court to admit, in certain specified circumstances, previous witness statements where a witness recants or refuses to testify at trial. This provision is designed to ensure that witness statements may still be available to the Courts even though the witness subsequently refuses to co-operate because of intimidation.  Section 26 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 empowers a Court, following the conviction of a person for a serious offence, to make a "protection of persons" order. The purpose of the order is to protect the victim of the offence or any other person named in the order from harassment or intimidation by the offender.  Other persons that might be listed in such orders include the relatives of the victim or witnesses.

The numbers of such prisoners on temporary release fluctuates on a daily basis and to date in the year 2010, the numbers have fluctuated between slightly above 500 to slightly above 600.The Criminal Justice Act 1960 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 sets out the framework for the temporary release of prisoners.  Prisoners may be granted  temporary release to assess a person's ability to reintegrate into society, to prepare him or her for release, to assist the Gardaí, on grounds of health, on other humanitarian grounds, to ensure the good government of prison and to maintain good order and humane and just  management of the prisons.   All prisoners on temporary release are subject to conditions and are returned to prison if their behaviour gives rise to concern.  Public safety is the paramount consideration in any decision on granting temporary release.

Their purpose is to provide a forum where An Garda Síochána and the local authority — the two organisations which make the most significant contribution to preventing and tackling crime in a specific area — can come together, with the participation of members of the Oireachtas and community and voluntary interests, on matters affecting their area.During 2006 and 2007, Committees were established in 29 local authority areas in a pilot phase, prior to extending them to all 114 county, city and town council areas.  The guidelines under which these operated were amended in the light of the experience gained in their operation.  On 24 September, 2008 I launched, with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, amended guidelines, which took into account the experience gained during the pilot phase and provided for the establishment of Committees in all 114 local authority areas by the relevant local authorities and the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to last December Committees have been established in 98 local authority areas, representing 84% of the total.The operation of the Committees is kept under ongoing review by my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It should be noted that each Committee is required to submit an annual report of its activities, and these inform the ongoing consideration of the operation of the Committees.I have no plans at this time to amend the legislation under which Committees operate.

It has been a singularly successful initiative and reflects the strong sense of voluntary commitment from the individuals concerned. I am confident that it will continue to flourish into the future.To date approximately 40  Reserve members of An Garda Síochána have moved on to become trainee full-time members.  I believe that it is a significant success for the Garda organisation as a whole that Reserve members are being attracted to become full-time members and the Garda Síochána Admission and Appointments Regulations, which govern full-time entry to An Garda Síochána, provide that recognition is given for satisfactory service in the Reserve.The specific duties assigned to members of the Garda Reserve are a matter for the Garda Commissioner under Section 15(5) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.

The scheme provides for compensation for the family of a deceased member where death resulted from malicious injury and provides a mechanism to apply to my Department for authorisation for cases of malicious injury of a non-minor nature to be assessed by the High Court. It also provides for compensation to a member for a malicious injury of a minor nature where the duty being performed involved special risk.There has been a shared view for some time that the existing scheme needs to be replaced with a more efficient process. The scheme, whereby all cases must go to the High Court, is liable to delays and high legal costs, and lacks facilities to settle claims in an efficient manner consistent with recent developments in processing personal injury claims.  A Review Committee was formed after a High Court judgement in 1996 and recommended a replacement of the existing scheme.  In 2008, my Department, through the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration (C&A) Scheme, revisited the work of the Review Committee.My Department is currently working with Garda management and in consultation with the relevant stakeholders in the Garda C&A Scheme to develop proposals with the objective of establishing a more cost effective compensation scheme which will deal with compensation claims for malicious injuries in an efficient manner and to the satisfaction of all interested parties. I will carefully consider the final proposals and bring forward any necessary, related legislative measures.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	649	Increased civilian support for the Garda Síochána does not necessarily take the form of one for one replacement of individual Gardaí with civilians. In some instances it enables the replacement of sworn members, who are engaged in exclusively clerical, administrative or technical duties, with civilian staff. In others, it allows sworn members who would otherwise have to devote a significant part of their working day to performing administrative duties to focus exclusively on front-line policing duties.  Civilian staff may also be recruited to perform new or expanded administrative, managerial and professional support roles in the Garda Síochána, for example as crime analysts or IT specialists.On this account, and because of the significant restructuring of roles, functions and business areas that has taken place at all levels of the Garda Síochána in recent years, it is difficult to quantify the exact number of posts which were occupied by sworn members but which today are held by civilians. I can however confirm that since 2003 the number of civilians  in the Garda Síochána has risen to approximately 2,115 whole time equivalents. While this is still a lower proportion compared to some similar police services in other jurisdictions, the Commissioner is committed to increasing this number further as resources allow.Civilian staff are now involved in the provision of vital support services in a wide range of administrative, professional, technical and industrial areas, including Human Resources, Training and Development, IT and Telecommunications, Finance and Procurement, Internal Audit, Communications, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services.  In addition, a number of essential operational support areas are now wholly or largely staffed by civilian staff, such as the Central Vetting Unit and the Fixed Charge Processing Office in Thurles and the Garda Information Services Centre which is based in Castlebar.  The Garda Síochána Analysis Service, to which I referred earlier, is staffed by qualified and highly trained civilian analysts. Civilian Telecommunications Technicians also provide front-line support to the whole of the Garda organisation across a range of technologies and services. The augmented civilian element in the Garda organisation which has been deployed by the Garda Commissioner in recent years has made a dramatic improvement to the effectiveness of law enforcement in this State through freeing Garda resources for front line policing.

Section 8 of the Act schedules the organised crime offences specified for the purpose of the provisions under the Offences Against the State Act 1939 relating to the use of the Special Criminal Court.This piece of legislation is aimed at tackling serious crimes and I can assure the House that An Garda Síochána have been actively using its provisions to target and disrupt organised criminal networks and their activities.Given the serious nature of the offences dealt with under the legislation in question a full and thorough investigation of individuals and their activities is necessary and must be conducted before charges can be brought against them.Given the relatively recent enactment of this legislation it remains too early to collate meaningful statistics in relation to the operation of all of its provisions. I am however advised that a number of investigation files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.I can assure the Deputy that An Garda Síochána will continue to utilise all available legislation, including all the additional legislative provisions introduced by the Oireachtas in 2009 relating to organised crime, to develop and implement strategies to continue to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks.

I have asked that this group report to me directly and I will then consider their findings in the light of any suggested amendments to legislation.

Therefore an accurate breakdown as requested by the Deputy for that period is not available without the manual examination of records going back over a considerable time period.From May 2008 (when new security initiatives were first introduced) to 31 December 2008, there were 351 drug seizures within the Irish prison system.  In 2009, prisons recorded seizures of drugs as set out in the table below.  The security initiative introduced by the IPS clearly has greatly strengthened the ability of the prison system to intercept illicit substances. The following figures reflect the IPS's success in this regard:Prison/Place of DetentionNumber of Drug Seizures in 2009Arbour Hill Prison0Castlerea Prison65Cloverhill Prison97Cork Prison35Dóchas Centre11Limerick Prison75Loughan House12Midlands Prison93Mountjoy Prison (male)547Portlaoise Prison20Shelton Abbey19St. Patrick’s Institution92Training Unit60Wheatfield Prison167Total1,293The Irish Prison Service does not have the facility to test substances found or seized and therefore cannot state definitively the type or value of drugs seized.  Gardaí are contacted once suspected drug seizures are made and issues of investigation and prosecution fall within their remit.The Irish Prison Service continues to work to implement it's Drug Policy and Strategy, entitled "Keeping Drugs Out of Prison", which was launched in May 2006.  Working to fulfil the commitments contained in the Policy and Strategy involves the implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners treatment and rehabilitative needs.Drug Users present with multiple and complex problems.  The evidence would indicate that a multidisciplinary approach is needed to effectively care for this group and that maintenance of a personalised therapeutic relationship yields the best outcomes.  Prisoners have access to a range of medical and rehabilitative services such as psychosocial services and work and training options which assist in addressing their substance misuse issues.The Irish Prison Service has committed significant investment in recent years in responding to addiction issues in the prison system.  The most significant new development was the awarding of a contract for addiction counselling services to Merchants Quay Ireland.  The Addiction Counselling Service is, in conjunction with other developments, now delivering an average of 1,500 prisoner contacts per month.The priority of my Department and the Irish Prison Service is, notwithstanding present resource difficulties, to ensure that an appropriate range of treatment services is available to all prisoners requiring same.

This is the sixth report of the Inspectorate and it focuses on the allocation of human resources in frontline, uniform policing.The report contains many positive recommendations on how the fluctuating demand for policing services can be better measured and how Garda resources can be more efficiently deployed to meet that demand.The Inspectorate's report suggests that fewer stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Region need to be open for administrative services to the public on a 24/7 basis, potentially freeing up more Gardaí for frontline operational duties.  The Garda Inspectorate has not recommended the closure of any stations. The Garda Commissioner, who has made clear the priority he gives to maximising operational strength, will consider this recommendation in the context of the report as a whole and in the light of his assessment of Garda operational requirements.

It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the matter.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	660	The allocation of Garda resources, including the distribution of personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management.  They are aided in this by a distribution model which indicates the most effective means of distributing Garda personnel and acts as a guide to Garda management decision making.  It takes into account different policing variables, including crime trends, socio-economic factors, and census information.The Deputy will understand that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific details of Garda activities to combat the threat posed by paramilitary groups.  It is the case, however, that close co-operation exists at all levels between the Garda Síochána and its counterparts in Northern Ireland in the context of countering and investigating the activities of so-called dissident groups.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	661	While I am concerned at some of the trends shown in the crime statistics released by the CSO for the last quarter of 2009, it would be unfair to An Garda Síochána not to recognise that there were reductions in nine of the fourteen crime groups covered by the statistics.I welcome the decrease in the numbers of cases of manslaughter and dangerous driving causing death.  However I am still concerned by the number of such crimes.  Many murders are gang related which underlines the necessity of the tough legislation enacted last year and which is now being fully utilised by the Gardaí.I am heartened by the decreases in public order offences (down 7.8%) and controlled drug offences (down 6.3%) shown in the CSO figures.I note that all property crime (robbery, burglary and theft) increased by 2.2% in 2009.  Both the Garda Commissioner and I are concerned at this increase.  Some of this may be due to bogus callers to the homes of elderly and vulnerable people.  I am awaiting a review of laws relating to introducing mandatory sentencing of those convicted of such crimes against the most vulnerable in society.I note the increase of 80.5% in kidnapping and related offences and that this crime group includes abduction of persons under 16 years of age — generally in connection with family custody disputes.  Much of this increase is accounted for by the inclusion of new human trafficking offences, which highlights the major work Gardaí have undertaken in this area.In the present economic circumstances no area can be immune from pressure on public spending, but in the justice area the highest priority is being given to the frontline fight against crime.  As evidence of this, the Government has agreed to 170 promotions taking place within An Garda Síochána which will enable senior posts to be filled.  While we are facing difficult economic challenges I believe that the budgetary allocation for An Garda Síochána in 2010 will allow us to continue to prioritise resources to deal with crime.

In respect of the incidents that occurred to 1 February 2010 there have been three arrests.  In respect of the incidents that occurred in 2008 and 2009 there has been a total of 92 arrests, there have been four convictions and in another 59 cases the matters are currently before the courts or files are with the DPP.The remainder of the information provided previously is unchanged.

These are:that young people and the vulnerable are protected,that gambling should in all respects be fairly and openly conducted, andthat gambling is kept free of crime.The initial consultation phase of the review process is now completed.  Since 1 May, 2009, material on my Department's website in this connection was viewed over 3,800 times; there have been 200 individual response to the invitation to register on the website in order to obtain e-mail updates on the review process; 69 submissions have been received from interested organisations and individuals and over 50 face-to-face meetings have been held with interested parties.My Department is now completing an examination of the submissions received. Based on that examination and taking account of the Report of the Casino Committee, Regulating Gaming in Ireland, I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval of policy proposals for a new gambling architecture in the State.

Liaison is being maintained with the family of the person referred to.The Deputy will appreciate that, as the investigation is ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.

The Commission had indicated that the date for completion of submissions on its Paper was the end of January 2010. It is aiming to have its Final Report available by end of August 2010.I can assure the Deputy that the Government is considering all avenues of approach in this area and, in so far as the final recommendations of the Law Reform Commission are concerned, it intends that early action be taken by the relevant Departments, including my Department.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	671	The location of the site visits by potential investors to County Donegal in each of the years 2003 to 2009 is set out on the following tabular statement.IDA Ireland is actively encouraging new investment in Donegal in knowledge-based industries.  This is part of a focused strategy to replace the traditional clothing and textile industries that have been declining in the north west region in recent years.  During the last five years IDA-supported companies in Donegal have created over 663 new jobs.There are presently 12 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Donegal, trading internationally and employing 1,683 full time and 128 part time people in software development, systems development and the medical technology industry.  Donegal's industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry to high tech, high skill activity.  Companies such asPramerica and UnitedHealth, which have located in Donegal are continuously growing and recruiting.The agency's emphasis is to build up an international and financial services cluster and is making strides in delivering on this, evidenced by the existing quality of the companies and the recent announcement of an expansion of 123 jobs by SITA INC.  In addition IDA is actively promoting Donegal as a successful location for high-end manufacturing mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector.  This is proving successful with projects from Medisize and Zeus Industrial Products Inc. who have opened a European Operations Centre for the production and distribution of precision medical tubing products.Another primary focus for IDA in Donegal is the designated linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry and significant investment has also been undertaken in developing property solutions through the provision of a Business and Technology Park along with three advance buildings in Letterkenny.This focus involves developing stronger economic links with Invest Northern Ireland, which includes initiatives like the north west Business and Technology Zone.  This is aimed at promoting the linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry in line with the objectives of the NSS 2002-2020 and the NI Regional Development Strategy 2025.The delivery of physical, social and economic infrastructure is key to securing inward investment and IDA Ireland continues to be engaged in identifying and prioritising investment in these areas in association with local partners.  In that context the interdepartmental group report published previously by Minister Martin outlined the wide range of infrastructure projects completed and under way which have and will continue to support the environment in Donegal for job creation.YearLocations Visited2003LetterkennyBuncrana2004LetterkennyBallyshannonBunbeg2005LetterkennyDonegal Town2006LetterkennyBuncrana2007Letterkenny2008LetterkennyBuncrana2009Letterkenny

These criteria were formulated by FÁS in conjunction with this Department and with the agreement of the Department of Finance and the union representatives of the Job Initiative team leaders.  The criteria, as set out in my earlier reply, encompassed co-operation with the principles concerning public service modernisation and flexibility; industrial relations stability; co-operation with the roll-out of the FÁS Community Services Management (CSM); implementation of quality assurance policies and procedures; and co-operation with ongoing operational and technological change on schemes.On final evaluation, all relevant Job Initiative projects (i.e. those with a team leader) achieved the requisite compliance level with the requirements for receipt of the Towards 2016 Phase 3 and 4 increases.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	679	There were 987 IDA supported companies operating in Ireland in 2009.  A breakdown of that number on a county-by-county basis is shown in the following tabular statement.Despite the difficult global economic environment Ireland continues to attract foreign direct investment from many of the world's leading companies and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will continue to be a key driver of employment, exports and growth.  Ireland's corporate tax rate of 12.5%, our multilingual skilled workforce and our strategic location to serve markets in Europe, has served us well in attracting investors and will continue to do so.  Many multinational companies are restructuring their global operations, leading to global rationalisation, making it particularly important to work to retain current investment, stimulate expansion, and secure new projects.
I am in the process of reviewing a new strategy for the future direction of FDI, which IDA has developed, and subject to my approval, will shortly be published.  This strategy will set out some specific initiatives, which IDA will be undertaking to retain existing and secure new FDI.  In addition, it will identify opportunities in the FDI markets, while stressing the importance of restoring our relative international competitiveness if we are to maximise FDI potential.While it is clear that we are operating in a very difficult economic environment, there are still investment opportunities in global markets and IDA will continue to compete vigorously for projects for Ireland.  Already in 2010 IDA has had some success in attracting FDI and to date there have been eight announcements with the potential to create at least 350 new jobs.CountyNumber of IDA supported companiesCarlow9Cavan5Clare9Cork134Donegal13Dublin482Galway48Kerry14Kildare26Kilkenny4Laois4Leitrim5Limerick39Longford7Louth22Mayo18Meath14Monaghan6Offaly7Roscommon8Sligo20Tipperary North4Tipperary South11Waterford32Westmeath18Wexford11Wicklow17Total987

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 20 July, 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from July 2009.  I understand that in this case, my Department is in contact with the appointed liquidator and, as soon as the outstanding issue is resolved, the claim will be processed without further delay.

In addition, there are a further 1,066 placements currently available to be filled throughout Ireland.  The location of these available placements is outlined in the table below.The programme is open to State agencies and public bodies to provide placements.  At this stage there are no plans to mandate such bodies to provide placements under the work placement programme.  However, FÁS are continuing to promote the programme with potential providers in the public, private and community and voluntary sectors.  It is expected that the number of placements will continue to rise and will I anticipate reach 2,000 in the coming months.FÁS RegionAreas/CountiesNumber of Available Posts 3rd Feb 2010Dublin CentralBaggot Court, D’Olier House, Parnell Street, Ballyfermot, Cabra152Dublin NorthBaldoyle, Balbriggan, Swords, Blanchardstown, Coolock, Finglas92Dublin SouthRathfarnham, Crumlin, Tallaght, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Dun Laoghaire, Loughlinstown111MidlandsKildare, Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath76Mid WestClare, Limerick, Tipperary92North EastCavan, Louth, Meath, Monaghan104North WestDonegal, Leitrim, Sligo71South EastCarlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary South, Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow137South WestCork, Kerry111WestGalway, Mayo, Roscommon120Total1,066

The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no function with respect to operational matters carried out by the Authority, including inspections and investigations undertaken by qualified Inspectors under the Act.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	688	The information supplied by the Deputy does not provide a sufficient basis to indicate whether this question relates to matters which come within the remit of my Department or in relation to which I have day-to-day responsibility.For the assistance of the Deputy, I should say that statutory obligations under employment law generally rest with employers.  Statutory obligations under occupational health and safety law are primarily a matter for employers although employees also have duties.  In both codes, the issue of the existence of an employment contract is central.While employers may have obligations to keep certain records under both codes, if the matters, which the Deputy may have in mind, are alleged to have occurred a long time ago, it is unlikely that there will be any statutory requirement on employers, should they still exist, to maintain relevant records up until the present day.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	689	To enable unemployed individuals, including those who are aged between 18 and 25 years of age, to continue to access education, training and work experience programmes, the Government has significantly expanded existing activation provision.  For instance, my Department will this year deliver approximately 147,000 training and work experience places for the unemployed compared to the 66,000 places that were delivered in 2008.This additional provision has been achieved through increased resources, providing an increased range of different course types and introducing new initiatives such as the work placement programme.  Under this programme, participants can avail of a work experience placement of up to nine months.  In addition, there is also specific provision aimed at early school leavers such as the Youthreach programme, which currently has 6,000 places.As there are no limits on the number of FÁS training interventions that an individual can receive, all individuals are free to take up further training courses upon the completion of the programme they are currently on subject to availability.It has also been decided that certain cohorts of the unemployed are accorded priority access to the current range of supports.  These cohorts are as follows:People with low skills or education levels, i.e. unemployed people who do not have a leaving certificate qualification or equivalent;People who are on the live register for long periods (over one year)- this includes people who are in receipt of jobseeker's allowance/benefit for one year or longer;People who are under 35 years of age, with at least 30% of training places reserved for those aged under 25 years;People who were previously employed in sectors that have been most affected by restructuring and where recovery to near previous levels is not in prospect in the short to medium term (mainly construction, manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade).As the under 25s account for 19.6% of those currently on the live register I am seeking to ensure that young people will have enhanced access to FÁS labour market activation provision this year.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	690	On 2 September 2009, I announced the establishment of Dublin Aerospace Limited, a new aviation maintenance provider supported by Government through Enterprise Ireland.  Dublin Aerospace aims to establish a best-in-class maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility at Dublin Airport, servicing APUs, landing gear, base maintenance and training.  The company has commenced operations with 70 initial employees recruited.  This number is anticipated to grow to 226 jobs.The garage business unit of SR Technics has been taken over by the M50 Truck and Van Centre who were successful in securing the airside vehicle maintenance contract from SR Technics.Aer Lingus has decided to undertake line maintenance operations previously contracted to SRT.  A number of employees will transfer from SRT to the new line maintenance operation at Aer Lingus.Last October, my Department submitted a provisional application to the European Commission for co-financing support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) towards the cost of a personalised package of training, educational and entrepreneurial services to workers made redundant at SR Technics.The Commission has sought additional information in relation to the application which my Department is currently preparing.  State agencies such as FÁS and Enterprise Ireland have made, and continue to make, the full range of their employment, training, guidance and advisory services available to workers made redundant at SR Technics.  The EGF does not support passive social protection measures such as retirement pensions or unemployment benefits.  The EGF only funds active labour market interventions such as job-search assistance, occupational guidance, training and re-training, outplacement assistance and entrepreneurship promotion and aid for self-employment.The information day for former SR Technics workers held at the ALSAA, Dublin Airport on 9 December was organised and funded by Dublin City University.  All former SR Technics workers who had engaged with FÁS Employment Services were invited to attend.  Statutory bodies and agencies such as FÁS, Enterprise Ireland, County Dublin VEC and a large number of third level educational establishments from Dublin and Dundalk were present.  Reimbursement of these costs will be sought by my Department under the technical assistance budget available under the EGF.Subsequent to the information day, learning assessment seminars at All Hallows College aimed at assessing the skills, aptitudes, experience and occupational preferences of former workers were held in January with a view towards guiding interested workers into the most appropriate avenue of further or third level study, to commence, in many cases, from the second academic semester in February 2010.In the event of a successful EGF application, EGF measures provided for eligible workers must be implemented by October 2011.

In this regard a Cross-Sectoral Group co-chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Health and Children has been established. It also include representatives from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Health Service Executive, and FÁS.The purpose of the group is to provide a mechanism for a cross sectoral approach between Government Departments and agencies with responsibility for delivering Government policy in respect of training and employment services for people with disabilities.  In addition, the group seeks to progress a targeted action plan based on the commitments in the relevant Departmental Sectoral Plans under the Disability Act 2005.Discussions are on–going in the sub-group in respect of these objectives with a view to finalising the draft outline for a comprehensive employment strategy as soon as possible.  On completion of this work, it is intended that the strategy will be referred back to the Consultative Forum under the Sectoral Plan of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and employment for proposed sign-off.

The revenue will, amongst other things, be used to boost energy efficiency, to support rural transport and to alleviate fuel poverty.  It is the general practice not to ring-fence revenues for specific purposes but rather take an overall view on priorities in the context of Expenditure decisions which, of course, are dependent on Exchequer revenues.  In this regard revenues from the carbon tax will facilitate investment in the aforementioned areas.

In this case, it appears that as ownership of an interest in a property is being transferred such a transaction, if effected by the execution of an instrument, could be liable to stamp duty under the provisions of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.The liability to duty of this instrument depends on certain conditions of the transfer and the circumstances of the purchaser.  These conditions would be: 1. the value of the property or interest held in the property, and 2. the circumstances of the purchaser insofar as s/he is regarded as a first time buyer and owner-occupier.With effect from 30th December 2009, a return must be completed in respect of the instrument in order to assess the charge to stamp duty and, on the payment of the stamp duty (if any), to obtain a stamp.

Mayo and, accordingly, a site was purchased at Knock Airport.   When planning permission was refused for the proposed development at Knock Airport, the Government decided that Charlestown should be the new location for the Department.  The Commissioners of Public Works identified a suitable site in Charlestown and terms were agreed. The purchase was not completed because the Government decided to defer a final decision on the decentralisation of the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to Mayo until 2011.

Prior to that date, the relief was available at the taxpayer's marginal rate.  Relief in respect of qualifying health cost is normally claimed for expenses that were paid in each tax year, from 1 January to 31 December. However, an election may be made to claim in respect of expenses incurred in the tax year even though they are paid later. If so elected, all amounts claimed for the year must relate to amounts incurred in that year. In this case, if all of the treatment was carried out in 2008 and the balance of payment was made in 2009, relief can be allowed at the taxpayer's 2008 marginal rate.  If the treatment was ongoing into 2009, relief must be claimed for 2009, for treatment carried out and paid for in that year, at the standard rate.

The need for it is further reduced this year because of the absence of any changes made to tax credits, bands or rates in Budget 2010.

With regard to future regulatory changes, the Government is reforming the institutional structures for financial regulation to prevent a recurrence of inappropriate and unsustainable business practices in the financial services sector.  We as a Government are moving forward through NAMA, the new guarantee scheme and the credit review system towards the objectives of maintaining a stable financial system and getting credit flowing to the real economy.  These initiatives will contribute to the Government's number one priority, the creation and protection of Irish jobs.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	705	A number of initiatives have been taken to secure efficiencies and to maximise value for money in public procurement. For example, my Department establishes and manages framework arrangements for the purchase of personal computers (desktops and laptops), colour and mono printers, mobile telephony services, a Government Communications Network for voice, data and video and associated products and services. These national  frameworks allow public bodies to operate much simpler procurement processes for these requirements. The arrangements maximise volume discounts and provide for reductions in administrative and transaction costs for suppliers and public sector purchasers. They are designed for use across the public sector and, for example, are tailored to the needs of the National Centre for Technology in Education to meet needs down to local school level.Similar type arrangements are in place for requirements in particular sectors. For instance, the Health Service Executive has a dedicated Procurement Directorate which contracts on a HSE wide basis across all categories of expenditure. Recent examples are — vaccines, electricity, medical equipment, renal dialysis and mobile telephony. HSE Procurement Directorate has established approximately 35 framework agreements for the purchase of certain categories of supplies and services.  Likewise, in a collaborative purchasing arrangement, the local authority sector has an online system of national tender lists for plant hire, haulage, tool hire and other common supplies and services acquired by 30 local authorities.A National Public Procurement Operations Unit (NPPOU) was established by Government in 2009 within the Office of Public Works. It subsumes the functions of the former Government Supplies Agency which placed contracts for commonly acquired supplies and services for the central Government sector.  The NPPOU's remit includes:(i) organising the procurement of common goods and services (e.g. office equipment, furniture, vehicles, fuel, electricity, travel, clothing, printing, advertising) across the public service;(ii) operating and developing the electronic tendering system and further developing and deploying appropriate and cost effective e-procurement systems;(iii) providing professional procurement advice to the public service;(iv) assisting where appropriate with specialist procurement undertaken directly by public service bodies;(v) organising networks of procurement professionals; and(vi) developing procurement training and education measures.During 2009, the NPPOU brought together statistical information on the procurement expenditure of the top thirty spenders among state agencies. This is now being used by the Unit in its strategic approach to purchasing in various markets in 2010.

I should point out that this measure does not extend to those who took out qualifying loans in 2003. While circumstances and house prices differ, it is necessary to select a cut-off point in these matters. House prices increased significantly in 2004 and thereafter.I would accept that many people are suffering financially in the current climate.  However, as the Deputy will be aware there are already a number of supports in place, such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the services provided by the Money Advice Budgeting Services. I have spoken about these extensively in this House over the past number of months.  Since my Budget speech, I have also written to the Financial Regulator requesting that consideration be given to extending the moratorium on mortgage arrears from 6 months to 12 months for all mortgage lenders.In the Renewed Programme for Government, the Government has committed to a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) on debt default with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with mortgage problems.  I have discussed with Cabinet colleagues the best way in which to proceed in this matter and will bring proposals to the Government.Finally, it should be noted that loans taken out on or after 1 January 2013 will not qualify for mortgage interest relief and that mortgage interest relief will be abolished completely for the tax year 2018 and subsequent years.  Full details of the changes proposed in relation to mortgage interest relief are provided in the Finance Bill 2010 published today.

This report analysed the flooding events of early July 2009, hydraulically modelled the Wad River catchment, and reported on suggestions for alleviating flooding from severe storm events in the future.The report found that the previously preferred local flood alleviation option — namely, the construction of a duplicate Wad culvert — would not be a viable option, as it might increase the risk of flooding downstream in a built-up area close to the Clontarf seafront.  It did, however, recommend that a full Catchment Study, including Cost Benefit Analysis, should be carried out to establish the most appropriate measures to alleviate flooding in the area in the medium term.  Dublin City Council has appointed consultants to carry out the study.  Dublin City Council expects the study to be completed by the middle of 2010.

The tax was applied to petrol and auto-diesel with effect from midnight, 9 December 2009; and will apply from 1 May 2010 to kerosene, marked gas oil (also known as "green diesel" or "agricultural diesel"), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order.A Financial Resolution was adopted on Budget night in respect of petrol and auto-diesel and provided that those conventional transport fuels with a biofuel component of less than 10% would be taxed in full as petrol or auto-diesel as appropriate. However, the carbon tax charge would not apply to the biofuel element where biofuel constitutes more than 10% of the blended petrol or auto-diesel product. Such an approach was deemed necessary for administrative ease, however, I have received a number of representations concerning this approach and consequently the long-term approach in relation to the treatment of biofuels is being further considered as part of the Finance Bill process.

Where a homeowner's entitlement to mortgage interest relief would expire in 2010 or after, they will now continue to receive it up to the end of 2017.  Since my Budget speech, I have written to the Financial Regulator requesting that consideration be given to extending the moratorium on mortgage arrears from 6 months to 12 months for all mortgage lenders.As an additional support, the Irish Banking Federation has announced that its members will offer further reassurance to homeowners in difficulty with their mortgage repayments by holding off on legal action against those in difficulty, as long as the borrower complies with a mutually acceptable arrangement that can then be reviewed on a six-monthly basis.  This new undertaking by IBF members is in addition to the existing safeguards provided by the Statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears that applies to all institutions regulated in this country, not just the institutions covered by the Bank Guarantee Scheme.In the Renewed Programme for Government, the Government has committed to a review of the measures with a view to expanding the options available for dealing mortgage problems.  I have discussed with Cabinet colleagues the best way in which to proceed in this matter and will bring proposals to Government.The House will be aware that an Inter-Departmental review group, chaired by my Department, has begun an examination of additional measures that might be taken. The Group has met on two occasions and work has commenced on bringing forward options for dealing with these matters.  The Mortgage Arrears Review Group is examining options for improving State supports for home owners with mortgage arrears including schemes in operation in the USA and UK.  These schemes are designed to address particular problems for particular groups of home owners and include options for re-financing mortgages, modifying the terms of existing loans, shared equity, and purchase of mortgages for the purpose of renting back to the home owner.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I have always accepted the consensus view of the relevant expert bodies that the introduction of a universal high uptake vaccination programme in young girls, in conjunction with population based cervical screening, could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer incidence. The issue was not, therefore, whether the case for a cervical cancer vaccination programme was accepted by myself and the Government — because it always was — but how to place such a programme in order of clinical priorities for the allocation of scarce resources available for public health services and for the cancer programme in particular.Recently I requested the HSE to initiate a tendering process for the procurement of a HPV vaccine with a view to commencing a HPV vaccination programme for all girls in first year in secondary school and until this process was completed I was not in a position to say if or when I would introduce this programme. This tendering process for the vaccine is now complete.  We can now purchase the vaccine at a price much lower than we expected to pay in 2008 and at a price much closer to what is being paid in other countries. In these circumstances, the programme can now be delivered from the extra resources committed in this year's budget to the overall Cancer Programme.The HSE is committed to starting this campaign during the current school year.  This will involve the free vaccination of up to 30,000 girls mainly in school settings and an announcement of the details of the full programme involved will be made by the HSE in the near future. The programme will continue with vaccine being offered to all girls in first year in secondary school each year but it is not proposed to extend the vaccination programme to other classes at present. Unfortunately it will not be possible to refund the costs of vaccinations administered privately.

North South Ministerial Council 
The five designated areas of cooperation are Accident and Emergency/Acute Services, Emergency Planning, Cancer Research, High Technology and Health Promotion and progress continues to be made on these area of cooperation. Progress is also reviewed at the NSMC Health Sectoral meetings.  The latest meeting was held in Belfast in November 2009 and the next meeting is expected to take place in Dublin in mid 2010.
Joint Departmental Projects
My Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (NI) have undertaken a number of joint projects.  These include the establishment of a new radiotherapy centre at Altnagelvin Hospital (to be completed by 2015) and proposals to collaborate in providing Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Services in Belfast and Dublin.  A joint Feasibility Study on the potential for future cooperation has also been completed.  The Study made a number of recommendations across an extensive range of health services.  I have approved the Study and my colleague the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety is currently considering the matter.  Other joint Departmental initiatives include collaboration in other areas such as Suicide prevention, Pandemic Flu Planning, Child Protection and GP Out of Hours Services.
Cooperation And Working Together (CAWT)
Outside of the formal structure of the North South Ministerial Council the main vehicle for North/South cooperation is CAWT with a specific focus on border counties.  Both Health Departments have agreed to appoint CAWT as the Delivery Agent for the European INTERREG IVA 2006-2013 Programme — €30million for health related Projects over the lifetime of the Programme. The Operational Programme for the Health measure has been approved and implementation of various cross Border projects has commenced.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	723	I wrote to all Oireachtas members on 19th January 2010 regarding the Health Service Executive's decision to centralise the processing of all medical card applications and reviews and I outlined a range of measures being employed by the Executive to address issues arising from this initiative and I also referred to the various enhancements that this process will facilitate upon completion. In addition, my letter gave details of the two Local Health Offices (LHOs) that have already been centralised and referred to the HSE's intention to transfer the processing of medical card and GP visit card applications/reviews from all other LHOs in April this year.  I am able to confirm to the Deputy that the information provided in my letter reflects the current position in this regard.As the other aspect of the Deputy's question is an operational matter, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	724	Acute bed numbers in public hospitals are counted as an average of beds available over each year, given that the number of beds available in each hospital can vary over any year for operational reasons.  The number of acute beds in private hospitals at any time is not collected or verified by the Department of Health and Children or by the HSE, but data are provided by those hospitals themselves or by a representative association.The national average number of acute hospital beds available in public hospitals in 2007, the latest year for which validated data has been compiled by the HSE, was 13,688. This includes both in patient beds and day places. An average of approximately 20% of these are categorised as private beds.  In addition, there is private bed capacity in private hospitals.My Department has requested the HSE to provide validated data on the national average number of acute hospital beds available in 2008 to the Deputy as soon as this becomes available.In projecting forward to 2011, I am more concerned to see the most effective use of acute bed capacity for patient best care, through shortened lengths of stay and more day case activity, rather than projecting a particular number of beds. The quality of acute bed capacity, that is, the achievement of more single-occupancy rooms and a reduction of multi-bedded wards, is also an important consideration for better outcomes for patients.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	726	I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.There are two main cost factors associated with medical cards and GP visit cards, firstly the capitation and other payments made to General Practitioners (GPs) and, secondly, the cost of drugs supplied to patients.GPs who hold contracts under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme with the Health Service Executive (HSE) are remunerated principally on the basis of fees and payments set out in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2009, which came into effect on 7th July last.  Included among these fees are more than 50 different capitation fees.  The fees vary depending on the age and gender of the patient and the distance he or she lives from the GP's surgery.  For example, fees range from €76.98 for a male patient under 5 years living 3 miles or less from the GP's surgery to €218.37 for a female aged 65-70 years living more than 10 miles from the surgery.  In addition, there are special capitation rates of €280.31 for persons over 70 residing at home and €896.07 for persons over 70 residing in private nursing homes.  There are also a range of additional payments; for example, in respect of out of hours consultations, temporary residents, special items of services (e.g. suturing), panel size, practice support allowances and locum expenses.As regards the supply of drugs and medicines, medical card holders receive these free of charge while GP visit card holders avail of the Drugs Payment Scheme, which involves a co-payment of the first €120 spent per family in any calendar month.  Drugs costs vary significantly depending on the patient's medical condition.Given that there were 1,478,560 medical card holders and 98,325 GP visit card holders on the 31st December 2009, the variety of payment arrangements and the variation in drug costs, a single average annual cost figure in respect of the medical card and GP visit card is not a sufficiently refined measure for policy options and decisions.  For the Deputy's information, estimated total expenditure in 2009 on the GMS Scheme (medical cards and GP visit cards) was approximately €1.9 billion.I will shortly approve the HSE's 2010 Service Plan which provides estimates of the cost of the GMS Scheme in 2010.  I will arrange to have a copy of the Plan sent to the Deputy as soon as possible thereafter.

The figures are provided on a net basis, showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive's database, e.g. following a review of a person's circumstances. The most recent figures provided by the HSE to my Department reflect the position on 31st December 2009 and show 98,325 GP visit card holders on that date.As the other information sought by the Deputy is not provided by the HSE to my Department as a matter of routine, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address these matters and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The Working Group's terms of reference included the development of an appropriate policy framework for rehabilitation and a preferred model of care for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services to people with neurological conditions and other significant physical conditions, including people with muscular dystrophy.  A report is expected in the first half of 2010.The Government is also undertaking a review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the health and personal social services for people with disabilities in Ireland.  This review is part of the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review programme for 2009-2011.  This in-depth review will assess how well current health and personal social services for people with disabilities meet their objectives.  The evaluation will focus on the current provision of disability services and explore the way forward for the development of services within a value for money and policy framework. The objectives of the review are to examine disability services in Ireland funded by the Health Service Executive, deliver a comprehensive analysis of data in relation the services and service providers and review current policy objectives and provide policy objectives for further service provision.  A structured consultation process with both service users and service providers, including people with muscular dystrophy, is an integral part of the review.  It is expected that the review will develop proposals to achieve optimal effectiveness and efficiency within the existing substantial resources expended on health and personal services for people with a disability and also support the future planning and development of services.

The proposed amendment requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention.With regard to "independent" adoptions, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the provisions set out in Part 13 of the Adoption Bill which identify the restrictions on a person in seeking to make arrangements for adoptions. It also identifies the particular role of accredited authorities in this regard.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	734	As the Deputy will be aware the agencies under the aegis of my Department and the hospitals under the aegis of the HSE are public bodies for the purpose of all Prompt Payment Legislation, including the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 and the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002, and are therefore obliged to comply with the provisions of the legislation. It is a matter for each agency to ensure that it complies with the legislation. The 2008 Accounts for each of the agencies under the aegis of my Department have been examined and the Comptroller and Auditor General has not referenced any case where prompt payment legislation has been breached.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Health Services Executive to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy in relation to hospitals under the aegis of the HSE.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	735	Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. It is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.In relation to the tender process referred to by the Deputy, the HSE has advised that the intention is to appoint successful parties onto a Framework Agreement for the provision of Recruitment Agency Services for NCHDs and Consultants.  This Framework will require these parties to sign formal service level agreements ensuring full compliance with the HSE's requirements. The Framework Agreement has been signed off by the HSE and the Recruitment Agencies and covers the terms for engagement with multiple suppliers for the next two to four years.  It is intended to finalise and implement year one of this Agreement in February 2010.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	736	I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 154 together.I have responsibility for the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which was introduced in January of this year.The scheme is open to children aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months in September of each year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 qualify for the free preschool year in September 2010 and children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 will qualify for the free preschool year in September 2011.  Exceptions to the upper age limit are allowed where children are developmentally delayed or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of local primary schools.  I understand that, to date, 108 appeals on these grounds have been allowed with 105 of these being allowed on the basis of developmental delay and 3 being allowed on the basis of the enrolment policy of local primary schools.While the majority of children commence school between the age of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months, it is accepted that some parents choose to send their children to primary school at an earlier age and the ECCE scheme allows for children to avail of the preschool year and still commence primary school when they are just over 4 years 2 months of age.  However, the objective of the scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the key developmental year before they commence primary school, with appropriate age related activities and programmes being provided to children within a particular age cohort.  Targeting the preschool year at a particular age cohort is clearly fundamental to the scheme and it is necessary, therefore, to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will participate in the scheme each year.I am satisfied that the age range set for the scheme achieves a reasonable balance between supporting the provision of appropriate age related programmes and activities and providing flexibility to parents and their children and there are no plans to review the position at this stage.

Approximately 4,000 pre-school services throughout the country are participating in the ECCE scheme.  Each of these was required to make a return to my Office, by 29 January 2009, giving details of qualifying children attending.  As these returns are currently being processed, I am not yet in a position to furnish the information requested by the Deputy.  I understand that the Childcare Directorate of my Office will complete the processing of service returns very shortly following which details of the number of children availing of the scheme, broken down by reference to the areas covered by the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs), will be available.

The reductions applied to the Drugs Payment Scheme.The main changes were:A new dispensing fee structure based on a sliding scale as follows: €5 for first 20,000 items, €4.50 for next 10,000 items and €3.50 for the remaining items. This applies to items dispensed under the GMS (Medical Card), Drugs Payment Scheme and Long Term Illness Scheme.Retail Mark-up in the Drugs Payment Scheme is reduced from 50% to 20%.Wholesale Mark-up reduced from 17.66% to 10% of the ex-factory price of drugs.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	741	I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 to 161, inclusive, together.The Department of Health and Children is committed, in partnership with other stakeholders, including the Health Research Board, to the development of improved health information systems including data requirements for health and personal social services for people with a disability. The development of information systems must recognise the requirements of  the Disability Act 2005 and the current disability databases.  I expect the outcome of the Department's Value for Money Expenditure and Policy Review of Disability Services to direct the future information requirements for the provision of health and personal services for people with a disability.The focus of health service provision for people with a disability is not a medical diagnosis.  The Disability Act provides for, among other things, an individual assessment of need, a person centred service statement and the provision of individualised supports.  This policy moves away from the provision of segregated, health based, group services for people with a disability.The National databases provide information in relation to the level of services being provided and current and future needs of people with a disability.  The databases do not identify persons with specific disabilities such as Autism or Downs Syndrome.

The primary functions of Wisdom are to assist in the coordination of mental health services for the individual, to provide management information to improve the effectiveness of service provision, to provide data for national reporting purposes and research.  The system has the potential to be used ultimately for national reporting on mental health services in Ireland and for research to inform mental health policy, planning and practice.  Wisdom is currently being rolled out in Donegal in a proof of concept  phase.  This phase is eighteen month duration and is due to be completed in June 2010.

The HSE has published the weekly cost of care in each public, private and voluntary nursing home on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme page of its website.Under the scheme, individuals make a contribution to the cost of their nursing home care based on their means. The HSE meets the full balance of cost over and above the individual's contribution in public, private or voluntary nursing homes approved for the purpose of the scheme.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	749	The HSE has prioritised the development of mental health services for children and young people. During 2009 the bed capacity for children and adolescents almost doubled, bringing the total number of in-patient beds to 30. In addition, two purpose built 20-bed units are under construction in Cork and Galway. In December 2009, there were a total of 55 Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams. A further eight teams are in development.The inappropriateness of admitting children to units providing care and treatment to adults is recognised but in the absence of an alternative, such admissions are sometimes necessary for the safety and treatment of the child.  In arriving at a decision to admit a child to an adult unit, due consideration is given to the risks to the child of not admitting him /her, and the potential adverse effects of such an admission.  The Mental Health Commission has issued an addendum to their code of practice relating to the admission of children to psychiatric hospitals which provides that:a) No child under 16 years is to be admitted to an adult unit in an approved centre from 1st July 2009;b) No child under 17 years is to be admitted to an adult unit in an approved centre from 1st December 2010; andc) No child under 18 years is to be admitted to an adult unit in an approved centre from 1st December 2011.  If, in exceptional circumstances, the admission of a child to an adult unit in an approved centre occurs, the approved centre is obliged to submit a detailed report to the Mental Health Commission outlining why the admission has taken place.

The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.When Exchequer grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation, at central level, to deal with weather contingencies.  Holding back such an allocation would mean a reduction in the road grant allocations made to all local authorities at the beginning of each year.The allocations made to local authorities are inclusive of a weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised in the annual road grants circular letter that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.My role in addressing damage caused to the road network is in disbursing the amount of money provided in the 2010 Estimates for funding regional and local roads, that is, €411.177 million, in the fairest manner possible.I have received a submission from Youghal Town Council, seeking additional funding for the repair of roads damaged by the recent severe weather.  I will have regard to this information when deciding on the 2010 regional and local road grand allocations. I will announce the allocations by mid February 2010 at the latest.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	759	Aviation security at EU airports is governed by EU Regulations (EC) Nos. 2320/2002, 300/2008 and 820/2008. These Regulations established common Community rules in the field of civil aviation security, in force since January 2003.  These Regulations and a series of supplementary implementing Regulations have been adopted into our National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP).All Irish airports with commercial flights are required to comply with the requirements of the EU Regulations and the National Civil Aviation Security Programme. These requirements include measures for the screening of departing passengers, their cabin and hold baggage. The EU Regulations stipulate that all departing passengers and their cabin baggage shall be screened in order to prevent prohibited articles from being introduced into security restricted areas and on-board aircraft.  The Regulations also specify the means by which passengers may be screened, including hand search and walk-through metal detection (WTMD) equipment. The use of body scanners as a method of screening passengers has yet to be approved by the EU. However, EU Regulations allow for trialling of new types of security equipment and body scanner technology has been and, continues to be, trialled at a number of EU airports. A special meeting of the European Union Regulatory Committee for Civil Aviation Security was held in Brussels on 7 January 2010. The Committee received a factual report from the authorities of the Netherlands and the United States on the serious incident that took place on flight NW 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit on 25 December 2009.Following an exchange of views on the security situation in the aftermath of that incident, the Committee unanimously underlined the need for an EU approach to addressing the security situation, including the use of imaging technology, commonly referred to as body scanners, as one means for screening passengers.The Commission is considering an initiative on imaging technology to reinforce passenger security, while at the same time addressing the conditions for using such technology, in particular, privacy, data protection and health issues.I am aware that Dublin Airport Authority has issued a tender notice seeking expressions of interest for the supply of body scanners. Dublin Airport Authority has indicated that this is merely a first step in preparing for the possible use of such technology and is aware that deployment at any airport in the State, even on a trial basis, would be subject to approval by my Department and the European Commission.Consideration of the use of body scanners has not reached the stage where any decision has been made as to whether, and if so to what extent, legislative measures will be required.  I have been advised by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that any measure introduced will have to comply with the rights and protections provided for in our Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.

The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.When Exchequer grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation, at central level, to deal with weather contingencies.  Holding back such an allocation would mean a reduction in the road grant allocations made to all local authorities at the beginning of each year.The allocations made to local authorities are inclusive of a weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised in the annual road grants circular letter that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.My role in addressing damage caused to the road network is in disbursing the amount of money provided in the 2010 Estimates for funding regional and local roads, that is, €411.177 million, in the fairest manner possible.I have, however, asked local authorities to provide details of exceptional road related costs associated with the November 2009 flooding and recent prolonged severe weather, which fall outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance. I will have regard to this information when deciding on the allocations.I will announce the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations by mid February 2010 at the latest.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	762	The legislation governing the retention of telephony data is at present at Part 7 of the Criminal Justice ( Terrorist Offences) Act 2005. The Communications (Retention of Data) Bill 2009, at present before this House, in transposing Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council into Irish law, will extend the obligation to retain data to internet data. The data can only be requested by the law enforcement authorities for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious offences, the safeguarding of the security of the State and the saving of human life. The retention period for internet data will be 12 months and the data to be retained will only be concerned with the who, when and where of a communication. The content of a communication will not be retained and cannot be requested.The question of privacy is addressed at paragraph (9) of the recitals to the Directive. It states that under Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), everyone has the right to respect for his or her private life and his or her correspondence. Public authorities may interfere with the exercise of that right only in accordance with the law and where necessary in a democratic society, inter alia, in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The paragraph also states that because retention of data has proved to be such a necessary and effective investigative tool for law enforcement in several Member States, and in particular concerning serious matters such as organised crime and terrorism, it is necessary to ensure that retained data is made available to law enforcement authorities for a certain period, subject to the conditions provided for in the Directive. It concludes that the adoption of an instrument on data retention that complies with the requirements of Article 8 of the ECHR is therefore a necessary measure.The Bill now before the House fully complies with the provisions of the Directive and, accordingly, I am satisfied that it is a proportionate response to the balance to be achieved between persons' privacy and the needs of  law enforcement authorities in tackling serious crime and safeguarding the security of the State.

They are aided in this by a distribution model which indicates the most effective means of distributing Garda personnel and acts as a guide to Garda management decision making.  It takes into account different policing variables, including crime trends, socio-economic factors, and census information.In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, this will be taken into account by Garda Management when they are  considering the distribution of resources in the area in question.

The two children were included as dependants in the mother's asylum application meaning that any decision made in relation to her case applied equally to the children.  The asylum application was refused following the consideration of the application by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  A third child was born in the State in early January 2008 and this child's application was also refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Arising from the refusal of the asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the persons concerned were informed, by letter dated 6 March 2009, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were given the options, to be exercised within a period of 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to deportation or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them.  They were also notified of their entitlement to  apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  The persons concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and also submitted representations pursuant to Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.The application for Subsidiary Protection was examined following which a decision was taken to refuse the application.  This decision was communicated to the persons concerned by letter dated 20 May 2009.  The case of the persons concerned was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 on the prohibition of refoulement.  Consideration was given to all representations submitted by and on behalf of the persons concerned and due regard was had for all national and international jurisprudence in terms of the humanitarian aspects of this case.  On 27 May 2009 Deportation Orders were signed in respect of the persons concerned.Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 provides the Minister with powers to amend or revoke a Deportation Order.  An application to revoke the Orders in respect of this family was made by its legal representatives on 1 February 2010.  Such an application to be successful must set out new facts or circumstances which have arisen and which were not capable of being advanced at the time the decision to deport was made.  This application will be considered as soon as possible and a decision will be taken to either affirm or revoke the Orders.

The Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve.  It has been a singularly successful initiative and reflects the strong sense of voluntary commitment from the individuals concerned.  I am confident that it will continue to flourish into the future.To date approximately 40 Reserve members of An Garda Síochána have moved on to become trainee full-time members.  I believe that it is a significant success for the Garda organisation as a whole that Reserve members are being attracted to become full-time members and the Garda Síochána Admission and Appointments Regulations, which govern full-time entry to An Garda Síochána, provide that recognition is given for satisfactory service in the Reserve.  I have no proposals to amend the Regulations at this stage  but I will keep the position under review.The specific duties assigned to members of the Garda Reserve are a matter for the Garda Commissioner under Section 15(5) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	775	I presume the Deputy, in referring to "unacceptable behaviour" of children, means behaviour of a criminal nature.  I wish to inform the Deputy that on 16 October 2006 the age of criminal responsibility was effectively raised from 7 to 12 years.  This came into force under Part 5 of the Children Act 2001, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Under the new provisions, no child under the age of 12 years can be charged with an offence.  An exception is made for 10 and 11 year-olds charged with very serious offences, such as unlawful killing, a rape offence or aggravated sexual assault.  In addition, the Director of Public Prosecutions must give consent for any child under the age of 14 years to be charged.Section 53 of the Children Act sets out a series of clear steps which a member of An Garda Síochána should undertake when faced with a child under the age of criminal responsibility who commits an offence—The Garda should take the child to its parent or guardian.Where the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing that the child is not receiving adequate care or protection, the Garda shall inform the HSE of the child's name, address and age and the circumstances in which the child came to the attention of An Garda Síochána.Where the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing (a) that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health and welfare of the child, and (b) that it would not be sufficient to await an emergency care order, the Garda may remove the child to safety.Section 53(4) of the Children Act states that it is the duty of the HSE to apply for a care order or supervision order where it appears to the HSE that the child is unlikely to receive the care and protection it requires under the circumstances described above.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	776	I presume the Deputy, in referring to "unacceptable behaviour" of children, means behaviour of a criminal nature. I wish to inform the Deputy that  the Children Act 2001, as amended, provides for a number of measures in relation to parental responsibility in respect of children aged 12 to 17 who are found guilty of offences or who are involved in anti-social behaviour.  With regard to children under 12 years of age, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 199 today.Section 111 of the Act provides that in any proceedings in which a child is found guilty of an offence, the court may make an order for the supervision of the child's parents where it is satisfied that a wilful failure of the child's parents to take care of or control the child contributed to the child's criminal behaviour.  Section 113 of the Act provides that where a court is satisfied of the guilt of a child and that the appropriate way of dealing with the case is to make a compensation order, it may order that the compensation be paid by the parent or guardian of the child instead of the child.  Section 114 of the Act provides that a parent or guardian may be ordered by the court to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper and adequate control over their child.  If the child is found guilty of another offence as a result of said parent or guardian failing to exercise such control, the parent or guardian would forfeit the recognisance.  It should be noted, however, that the imposition of any particular sanction referred to above on the parents or guardians of an offending child is a matter for the judiciary.In addition, Part 13 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced new measures with effect from 1st March 2007 to tackle anti-social behaviour of children through a civil process.  These measures provide that when a Garda becomes aware of anti-social behaviour, the Garda may issue a behaviour warning to the child.  Failure to obey the warning may result in a good behaviour contract being made involving the child, their parent(s) or guardian and the Gardaí.  If a contract is broken or if it is not working, it can be renewed or, an application can be made to the Children Court for a Civil Behaviour Order.  In addition to the Order, the court may also make a plan for the child to be supervised by their parents or guardian.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	785	Ireland is no exception to the international phenomenon where the prevalence of severe mental illness is significantly worse among offenders and prisoners in custody compared to the general population.  To properly discharge our responsibilities to prisoners with a mental health disability it is essential that we seek to integrate and further develop services, with statutory and voluntary partners. Mental health service provision in prisons must form part of the overall community response to this disability.  In recent years, the Irish Prison Service has specifically sought to actively recruit nurses with a mental health background.  As a consequence, the skill profile among that group has significantly changed and the health care team in our custodial institutions team are better equipped to meet the mental health needs of prisoners.  Current arrangements between the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) and the Irish Prison Service have ensured that 20 consultant-led in-reach forensic mental health sessions are held weekly in prisons in Dublin and Portlaoise.  The waiting list for admission to the CMH is reviewed weekly on the basis of reports, following assessments, and the relevant priority is attached to each likely submission.  In late 2008 and early 2009, ten additional beds were made available at the CMH.  The availability of the additional beds has been of considerable assistance to prison management and healthcare staff in tackling waiting lists for prisoners who require admission to the CMH in providing appropriate mental healthcare to treat acutely mentally ill prisoners.  The number of prisoners that engaged with the Mental Health Services in Mountjoy, St. Patrick's and Cloverhill Institutions over the months Nov 2009, Dec 2009 and Jan 2010 are set out in the following table:InstitutionMountjoy St.St. Patrick’sCloverhillNov-09243232Dec-09252528Jan-10272336The Mental Health Services in Mountjoy are provided by staff from the Central Mental Hospital, on a sessional basis.  This service is led by a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, and comprises of four registrar led clinics, one consultant led session and three CPN (Community Psychiatric Nurse) led sessions.  The service has been enhanced with the recent establishment of a nurse led mental health clinic.  The opening of the refurbished Separation Unit in Mountjoy Prison later in the year, will facilitate improved facilities for the assessment, treatment and ongoing supervision of vulnerable prisoners in an appropriate setting.  Decisions will then be made by the clinical team regarding their future case management either within the prison estate or in an external clinical setting.  Cloverhill Prison has a dedicated Psychiatric Inreach and Court Liaison Service which attends the prison five days a week.  The service is led by a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, two registrars and three community mental health nurses.  All new committals are screened and assessed by IPS nursing and medical staff and receive a further screen by the Psychiatric Inreach and Court Liaison Service.  Those requiring review are then assessed by the Psychiatric Inreach and Court Liaison Service.  The Cloverhill Prison Inreach and Court Liaison Service received awards for best hospital project and best overall healthcare project "An Duais Mor" at the 2009 Irish Healthcare Awards.In addition to arranging for treatment in prison and transfers to the Central Mental Hospital, the service has facilitated diversion of over 300 patients, mainly charged with very minor offences to local treatment facilities, following liaison with the courts.  An Adult Forensic Psychiatrist attends St. Patrick's Institution for 12 hours a week.  All new referrals are seen at the first opportunity on a needs basis.  St. Patrick's Institution also has a senior psychiatric registrar from the CMH assigned to it who attends once per week.  All referrals specifically requested by the GP and any prisoner that the health care multidisciplinary team have concerns about are reviewed by this CMH psychiatrist.  In addition, an addiction psychiatrist from the HSE provides one session per week to St. Patrick's Institution.

Garda accommodation requirements are considered in the context of the Garda Síochána's identified accommodation priorities and in light of available resources.I regret that the information requested by the Deputy is not readily to hand. I will write to the Deputy as soon as it is available.

The allocation of Garda resources, including the distribution of personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, his senior managers and Divisional Officers.  Garda management is aided in this by a distribution model known as the Garda Establishment Redistribution Model (GERM).I am advised by the Commissioner that this model indicates the most effective means to distribute Garda personnel and acts as a guide to Garda management decision making.  It takes into account many different policing variables, including crime trends, socio-economic factors, and census information.  The allocation of Garda personnel is determined by these factors and also takes account of the policing requirements of each individual Division.

Most recently, a Garda and a Customs Liaison Officer have been assigned to the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) in Lisbon which focuses primarily on coordinating action against drug trafficking from West Africa and South America.Where action is required to further frustrate the activities of Irish criminals who are based abroad, An Garda Síochána may avail of a range of options available to them under Mutual Legal Assistance arrangements, including the European Arrest Warrant scheme.The compilation of specific statistics relating to the number of times persons of interest are known to have entered or left this jurisdiction would take an inordinate amount of staff time and could not be justified given other pressing demands on resources.

I understand that this permission expired on 6 April, 2009 and has not been renewed since.Persons under the age of 16 years who reside as part of a family unit in which the parents of that unit have permission to remain in the State automatically avail of the permission granted to their parents.  On reaching the age of 16, such persons are required to apply to my Department to have that permission registered in their own right.  The person to whom the Deputy refers is therefore advised to write to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service at PO Box, 10003, Dublin 2 outlining her family circumstances.  Her case will then be assessed by the relevant officials and she will be contacted directly and informed of any decision made regarding her status in the State and any conditions attaching to same.

These programmes came to an end on 31 December 2009 and have been superseded by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).In advance of proceeding to establish a single programme across CDPs and Partnerships, my Department undertook an evaluation of individual community development projects.  Many of these projects span across two decades, with quite diverse activities.  The objective of the review was to identify those projects that produce tangible, appropriate benefits for the communities they serve.  The vast majority of projects, including the project referred to by the Deputy, fell into this category and have been provided with funding under the new programme in 2010.I am pleased to have been able to ring-fence funding for community development projects for 2010 and to maintain it at 2009 levels. In few other areas of public spending has it been possible to do this.The aim of the new LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  The new programme preserves elements of good practice from the CDP/LDSIP Programmes and will enable groups to objectively demonstrate the positive impacts they are securing for local communities.  An implementation strategy, involving the stakeholders, is underway for LCDP roll-out over the course of 2010.

Many of these projects span across two decades, with quite diverse activities.  The objective of the review was to identify those projects that produce tangible, appropriate benefits for the communities they serve.  The vast majority of projects fell into this category and were offered funding under the new programme in 2010.Where projects were not recommended for continued funding, an appropriate appeals mechanism was provided and a CDP Appeals Board established.  The Appeals Board completed its work on 29 January 2010 and the Deputy may be aware that its report has been published on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.  I am also arranging to have a copy forwarded directly to the Deputy.Following the initial review by my Department, 29 projects were deemed non-viable.  Of these, 24 projects submitted an appeal to the CDP Appeals Board, of which 10 were successful.  The following table lists the 14 projects that were unsuccessful in their appeals, as well as the funding each received in the period 2007-09.

The Deputy will appreciate that it is now a matter for the voluntary boards of management in each case to decide the future strategy for their companies in light of the decisions of the Appeals Board.  My officials have been in contact with each of the projects concerned and have indicated that if the company decides to cease operations and to wind-up, my Department will, without prejudice, seek to assist the directors in discharging their statutory responsibilities.  While such assistance could include limited financial assistance in appropriate circumstances, due account would have to be taken of the nature and extent of any net liabilities incurred by the companies and the financial and regulatory limitations applicable to my Department.The number of core staff (full-time equivalents) employed by CDPs that have been successful in obtaining funding under the new LCDP for 2010 is of the order of 290.  It is intended that the new programme will be implemented nationally on an integrated basis and through new integrated structural arrangements involving the 53 local development companies and the remaining CDPs.In that context, continuing CDPs retain their capacity to raise funding voluntarily and to apply any such funding to the purposes for which it was raised.Under the new programme, local development companies will be able to identify and meet the needs of communities and I have asked that particular attention be given to RAPID areas and to those areas where CDPs are no longer operating.As I have previously indicated, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department — especially those providing tangible benefits for the most disadvantaged communities — are protected.

I am aware that the Deputy has notified the Department of a particular case and the matter is being investigated. I will be in touch with him as soon as possible.In terms of the operation of the social insurance system, the Department holds contribution and claim history records for employed and self-employed contributors. Social insurance plays a key role in the provision of social protection in Ireland. As such, the contribution records established and maintained by the Department are used to determine eligibility for a range of benefits at certain specified times in a customer's life.Since 1953, the Social Welfare Acts have defined the various types of employment that are insurable under the social insurance system while also providing for the management and operation of that system (known, since 1979, as Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI)). Clearly, the integrity of the system is dependent on timely and accurate returns being made to the Social Insurance Fund by employers, employees and the self employed — again as laid down in social welfare legislation. A statutory basis therefore exists for, inter alia, the remittance and recording of contributions, inspection of employer records and, where necessary, ensuring compliance in matters relating to social insurance contributions.Records held by the Department for employees are on the basis of the person's Personal Public Services Number, formerly the Social Insurance or PRSI Number. Prior to 1979, social insurance contributions were recorded for each individual worker against this number; deductions were sent directly to the Department whereby employers purchased stamps for their employees and recorded them on cards. These cards were forwarded each year to the Department and the details recorded on each person's register sheet. Since 1979, contributions due to the Social Insurance Fund are collected in the main by the Revenue Commissioners together with income tax due. All employers must make tax/PRSI returns to the Revenue Commissioners which then compile the data and send it to the Department.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	845	The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. Its primary purpose is to assist existing tenants who can no longer afford their rent, for example, because they have become unemployed. The Rent Supplement Scheme is not intended to be an alternative to the social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.The 2009 Supplementary Budget introduced new arrangements for access to rent supplement. In order to qualify for a rent supplement, from the 27 July 2009, a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. However, a person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support, which the local authority is not in a position to provide at that time.In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where the claim to rent supplement is made and the person intends to reside. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.A person would not normally be entitled to rent supplement while engaged in full-time education. However, if an applicant has an entitlement to a back to education allowance, the person concerned may be entitled to rent supplement, subject to various conditions of the scheme being satisfied. Where a person has an entitlement to a back to education allowance and applies for rent supplement, the same criteria (the 183 day rule or has had a housing needs assessment completed with the relevant local authority) apply. A person moving accommodation, whilst in receipt of rent supplement, does not automatically lose their entitlement to rent supplement. A person moving location for the purposes of increasing the likelihood of securing full-time employment should therefore not lose their rent supplement entitlement, provided they continue to meet the other conditions of the scheme.

Work on the strategy is well advanced under the aegis of a National Advisory Group, headed by my Department and involving the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, social partners and other relevant stakeholders including the National Disability Authority.The strategy will support the provision of tailored housing and housing supports for people with a disability and will have particular regard to people who have a mental health disability.  The outcome of the evaluation of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, which is currently ongoing, will be considered in the strategy.  The strategy is expected to be completed later this year.Under the terms of the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, which is administered by the local authorities, grants of up to €30,000 are available to assist people with a disability to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs and to facilitate the continued occupancy of their own homes. Eligible works include the provision of access ramps, stair lifts, accessible showers, wheelchair access and extensions. The level of grant assistance available is significant and I have no plans to increase it, particularly taking account of the better value now available due to falling prices in the construction sector.My Department requested local authorities to submit details of their funding requirements under the grant schemes for 2010 by 22 January. The information received is being examined at present with a view to determining the allocations as quickly as possible.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	867	Deposit and refund schemes can contribute to the recovery rates for certain types of packaging waste.  Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Directive) is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market.   Under the Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005.Practical implementation of the Directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited which is operating successfully.  Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Packaging Directive introduces a new increased packaging waste recovery target of 60% (with 55% by way of recycling) as well as material specific recycling targets for glass, paper/board, metals, plastics and wood.  The National Waste Report 2008 states that packaging waste recovery increased to 65% in that year, indicating that Ireland has met and exceeded the target recovery rate of 60% set by the Packaging Directive for 2011.The recycling target for glass, which Ireland has to achieve by 2011, is 60%.  Ireland has already exceeded this target, the recycling rate for glass in 2008 being 74%.I am conscious that despite progress on recycling we need to continue to improve our performance.  The comprehensive review of waste management policy, underpinned by the recently published Eunomia Report, which I have initiated, will also consider the desirability of other producer responsibility schemes, including deposit and refund.

The slowdown in sales of affordable housing has moved in step with the process of correction in the wider housing market.  Since late 2008, my Department and the Affordable Homes Partnership have been working closely with local authorities to ensure that unsold affordable housing units are deployed effectively.Very considerable progress has been made on both the sale of affordable housing — despite the current difficult economic and banking climate — with over 1,300 affordable homes sold in the first 9 months of 2009, and the deployment of unsold affordable homes for other purposes, including temporary use under the social leasing or RAS schemes.Details of the numbers of unsold units on hands by local authority area are set out in the following table. While the sale of the affordable units on hands remains the preferred option, the local authorities are considering a wide range of options to bring these units into use.Local Authority AreaUnsold affordable housing units on hands (excluding units deployed for other housing purposes)Number in process of saleNet number of units on hands available for sale.County Carlow20020County Cavan909County Clare21021Cork City15854104County Cork15924135County Donegal18180Dublin City23346187Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown20884124Fingal245100145Galway City1367County Galway60060County Kerry381325County Kildare621052County Kilkenny23023County Laois30426County Leitrim101County Limerick17215Limerick City000County Longford101County Louth12012County Mayo17017County Meath351817County Monaghan000North Tipperary101County Offaly202County Roscommon202County Sligo303South Tipperary23023South Dublin811863Waterford City20020County Waterford220County Westmeath25322County Wexford202County Wicklow24519Totals1,5654071,158

As regards the combined scheme, my Department is currently examining the Council's Preliminary Report and a decision on it will be conveyed to the Council as soon as possible.Further progress on both schemes awaits the finalisation of the Water Services Investment Programme for 2010 to 2012, taking into account the priority attached to the schemes by Limerick County Council in its recent assessment of needs.  In July 2009, local authorities were asked to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October 2009.  My Department is currently considering these assessments, which form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme.   In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  I expect to publish the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012 early this year.

Commercial rates are normally paid by the occupier of the premises in question.The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority and the determination of the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to property valuations to calculate rates, is a decision taken locally by the elected members of a local authority in their annual budget.  I, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, have no direct function in the matter.I am nevertheless aware of the economic pressure on local businesses and in 2009 and 2010 I specifically requested that local authorities exercise restraint in setting commercial rates in order to support competitiveness in the economy and to protect the interests of communities.  Local authorities have responded well to this request and I will continue to keep the approach by them to rates under regular review.The question of the valuation of industrial and commercial premises is a matter for the Minister for Finance, as the Valuation Office comes under his remit.

The Service Indicators in Local Authorities 2008 report, a copy of which is available from the Oireachtas Library, includes information on Unaccounted for Water (UFW) in each local authority.During the period from 1996 to 2002 Dublin City Council, as the lead authority in the Dublin area for the water conservation programme, implemented active leakage detection and reduction, carried out some mains renewal and installed leakage control infrastructure.  This work, which was funded under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme, resulted in water lost through leakage, and otherwise unaccounted for, being reduced from over 42% to about 28%.My Department is now funding Dublin City Council's watermains rehabilitation programme, which is designed to build on the work already done and reduce further the level of unaccounted for water.

Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  These measures are provided free or at a token cost.  Private contractors under the Warmer Homes Scheme Plus were also engaged in 2009 to provide increased interventions such as central heating and internal drying insulation.Through these mechanisms, the WHS was delivered to 16,240 homes in 2009 which includes 3,571 under the WHS Plus.  A further 2,886 homes received the ESB's Home Insulation Scheme.  Some €20 million was provided for the scheme in 2009 including a contribution of €5 million from ESB and BGE.  This enabled energy efficiency improvements to be made to over 19,000 vulnerable homes at a cost of €14.518 million in 2009.Householders can also avail of grants of up to 40% of the cost of energy efficiency improvement measures under the Government's Home Energy Saving Scheme (HES).  This Scheme, which is administered by SEI, provides grant assistance to homeowners for retrofit energy efficiency measures such as attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.The HES was allocated €49 million in 2009.  The Scheme attracted 40,724 applications by the end of the year of which 36,454 were approved for grant aid.  In 2009, SEI paid out €16.26 million to improve the energy efficiency of 18,183 homes.Funding is allocated to both HES and WHS on a national basis.  SEI informs me that a total of 81 households in County Kildare had services provided to them under the WHS in 2009; 825 households under the Warmer Homes Scheme Plus and 669 under the Home Energy Savings Scheme.Funding in 2010 of €13 million for the WHS and €29.5m for the HES was announced on Budget Day together with €50m for the National Energy Retrofit Programme.This Programme will further reduce energy costs and carbon emissions in homes and business while also creating employment and developing a sustainable market for energy services in Ireland.  The detailed design and specification of the new programme is being finalised by my Department and SEI.  The Programme will be the subject of a public consultation in the near future.  In broad terms the Retrofit Programme will bring together the HES and the WHS as well as support programmes for business and the public sector.  It will also involve the development and promotion of energy services by the energy companies.This new Programme has the potential to be the most innovative, ambitious, energy-related initiative ever introduced in Ireland.  It will significantly reduce CO2 emissions and contribute to meeting the national efficiency targets including the target of 33% set for the public sector.  It will also create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal.It is important to stress that pending the introduction of the Retrofit Programme, the HES and the WHS are fully open for business in 2010.

The tax was applied to petrol and auto-diesel with effect from midnight, 9 December 2009; and will apply from 1 May 2010 to kerosene, marked gas oil (also known as "green diesel" or "agricultural diesel"), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas.  The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order.A Financial Resolution was adopted on Budget night in respect of petrol and auto-diesel and provided that those conventional transport fuels with a biofuel component of less than 10% would be taxed in full as petrol or auto-diesel as appropriate.  However, the carbon tax charge would not apply to the biofuel element where biofuel constitutes more than 10% of the blended petrol or auto-diesel product.  Such an approach was deemed necessary by the relevant Departments for administrative ease.  However, I gather that the Minister for Finance has received a number of representations concerning this approach and that the long-term approach in relation to the treatment of biofuels is being further considered as part of the Finance Bill process.Both my officials and I have had a series of discussions on this subject with the Department and Minister for Finance since late November.

These projects, through a variety of programmes and activities, seek, in the main, to encourage young people not to engage in drug-taking. My Department originally took on responsibility for funding these projects through a mainstreaming process, whereby projects on interim funding were assigned to a number of departments and State agencies.Thirty five of the projects are administered by the three VECs in Dublin City, Dublin County and in Dún Laoghaire, while the remaining three projects are funded directly by my Department. The allocations for the 38 projects over the past three years were as follows: 2007 — €3,621,000; 2008 — €3,715,000; 2009 — €3,643,000.Arising from Budget 2010, it was decided that funding for these projects was to be reduced to €2,461,000 in 2010. My Department is currently reviewing the implications of this decision for the individual projects concerned.

It is my intention to publish a list of successful SWS applicants in the Spring.This school submitted a capital application for extension and refurbishment in December 2002 which was then amended in October 2005 to apply for a new school building. The Department offered the school a grant under the Small Schools Scheme 2006 which the school declined. The application was subsequently assessed as an application for major capital funding and assigned a band rating of 2.1. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.In the meantime, the school applied for temporary accommodation.  In early May 2009, the Department approved a devolved grant to facilitate either the purchase of temporary accommodation or the building of an 80m2 permanent structure.  It was made clear to the school that this was an all in grant and that it was the responsibility of the school authority to manage costs to ensure delivery of the project within the resources available to it.The school advised the Department in July 2009 that they were going to build a permanent structure which would not be complete until May 2010 and sought grant aid for additional temporary accommodation in the meantime. The Department noted at the time that the devolved moneys were being used to build a larger extension than that sanctioned i.e. 121m2 to include a new classroom, staff room and link corridor in addition to the installation of a fire alarm system for the existing school building and the extension.The Department refused the request for additional grant aid for further temporary accommodation and advised the school in early August 2009 to either: a) Use moneys from the all-in-grant of €100,000 to rent a classroom during the construction stage; b) Partition an existing classroom on an interim basis; or c) Buy a prefab which would be available immediately.The school advised the Department in January 2010 that they had proceeded to install a temporary classroom in August 2009, without prior approval, while the permanent extension was underway and sought assistance with the costs and rental to May 2010. The Department does not pay retrospective funding for accommodation that it has not sanctioned and a letter to this effect has issued to the school authority.

The PRSI system applies universally to employees and the impact  of the measures introduced in Budget 2010 on the PRSI system is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

Work is well under way and the firm of specialists is working closely with officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department.The focus of this review is the development and adoption of practical measures and policies to achieve best value for money in the area of temporary accommodation in schools. Reports are being produced on individual schools with recommendations on the buy-out of certain prefab rental contracts.  While there is a degree of commercial sensitivity attached to these reports it is my intention to make these available once the process has been completed.  The firm of specialists are also preparing a set of standardised specifications for prefabricated accommodation and a suitable generic contract for the rental of prefabricated accommodation. I also intend making these available.My officials will continue to evaluate the progress and outcomes of the review.  Fees associated with this work are in the region of €340,000, a portion of which has been paid in 2009.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	890	The School Completion Programme is a key component of DEIS ( Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which discriminates positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The Programme, focusing on young people between the ages of 4 and 18 years, supports 468 primary and 223 post-primary schools in 124 School Completion Programme sites across 26 counties, with 3 SCP projects involving 8 post-primary schools and 12 primary schools participating in Co. Longford and Co. Westmeath.The main aims of the School Completion Programme are:To retain young people in the formal education system, or equivalent, to successful completion of the Senior Cycle.To improve the quality of participation and educational attainment of targeted children and young people in the educational process.To bring together all local stakeholders (home, school, youth and community/statutory and voluntary) to tackle early school leaving.To offer positive supports in primary and post-primary schools towards the alleviation of educational disadvantage.To influence in a positive way policies relating to the alleviation of early school leaving in the school system.Some €31million has been allocated to the School Completion Programme in 2010. Funding is provided to projects based on an integrated approach involving the schools, parents, relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies to devise and implement strategies for the whole-school, targeted strategies for individual students, and those who are already outside of the formal system. Provision includes in-school, after-school, out-of-school and holiday time supports to enhance the young person's readiness to benefit from education.School Completion Projects, through their annual Retention Plans, implement a range of flexible, age-appropriate interventions grounded in experience and best practice.  Following a consultative process with projects, the National Coordination Team has established that the supports implemented throughout the 124 SCP projects closely match those identified in international research as the most effective. The supports identified as most effective within SCP are extra-curricular activities, after-school/homework clubs, one-to-one support, personal development, meal clubs and holiday programmes.From 1st September, 2009, a single co-ordinated School Support Programme involving the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, the School Completion Programme and the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers has been integrated under the National Educational Welfare Board. This development puts in place structures to facilitate closer integration of the services at local, regional and national levels, increase effectiveness and help bring about real and meaningful improvements in services, to confront in a cohesive way, the underlying causes that impact negatively on the school life of children, particularly as they relate to school attendance, retention and attainment.My Department will forward details of individual schools in the Longford and Westmeath areas which are currently participating in the programme as well as details of the allocations to each project and programmes directly to the Deputy.

The Design Team are currently assessing the tenders and will issue a Tender Report shortly for my Department to consider.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	892	The Deputy will be aware that in November last year I published the "Smart Schools = Smart Economy" report, which is the new action plan for integrating ICT in schools. The Report, which was produced by the Joint Advisory Group, which I established earlier last year, builds on the earlier Strategy Group report, "Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools".  As a first step in implementing the recommendations of the report, €22m in ICT grants was issued to primary schools in November last.In order to ensure value for money and to make the procurement process easier for schools, schools have been  instructed to use National Framework Agreements, where such agreements are in place.  Four distinct National Framework Agreements, for the supply of specific categories of ICT equipment to schools, have been set up by the Department of Finance.  These  Frameworks are used to facilitate greater flexibility in the acquisition of goods and services, and support more responsive pricing mechanisms that deliver better value for money.The categories in question are PCs, Notebooks (laptops), Mono Laser Printers and Colour Laser Printers. The number of Suppliers on each Framework varies; the number of suppliers for PCs is five, and for Notebooks it is six, and all suppliers were selected following an open competitive tendering exercise, in compliance with EU and national procurement rules.In the interests of achieving best value for money, schools are required to use the Framework Agreements for the purchase of ICT equipment under the relevant categories. Schools can run a mini competitive tendering process by a simple email "Request for Quotation" to a single central email address, setting out their requirements. In addition to the core products of PCs and Notebooks, schools can also request quotations for associated services such as installation.While delivering competitive prices, the Frameworks are also all covered by a three year on-site next business day warranty and support. Operation of the Frameworks is governed by Vendor Participation Agreements, through which schools are able to benefit from a range of favourable terms and conditions, agreed in the aggregate for eligible non-commercial public sector bodies.  For procurement where Framework Agreements do not exist, schools are required to carry out normal competitive tendering processes under general public procurement rules.All schools who received ICT grants in November 2009 have been issued with a letter outlining the requirements to purchase from the Frameworks and to comply with public procurement rules. Additional specific guidance for schools regarding procurement and the Frameworks is available through the National Centre for Technology in Education.

Bus Éireann further advise that the pupil can avail of a service which has a pick up point 5.1 kilometres from home. Under the terms of the Primary School Transport Scheme, my Department is prepared to offer the family a Remote Area Grant towards the cost of arranging transport to the pick up point.The planning and organising of school bus routes is an operational matter for Bus Éireann. Bus routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible pupils have a reasonable standard of service while at the same time ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner. In order to achieve this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to both primary and post-primary schools. The service in question cannot be extended to provide a more convenient pick up point due to time constraints as the vehicle also operates a service to other schools in the area.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

The progression of a building project for the school from site acquisition through to initial design and construction will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	896	A new patronage model, under the aegis of County Dublin VEC is currently being piloted in two national schools — Scoil Choilim, Porterstown, County Dublin and Scoil Ghrainne, Phibblestown, Co. Dublin.  Legislation which will allow vocational education committees to become involved in the provision of primary education is currently being drafted and it is expected that a Bill will be published during the current session.My Department is currently consulting directly with patrons about specific areas where the establishment of new schools will be required and how emerging demands in these areas will be addressed. A review of procedures for establishment of new primary schools is being undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation. Among the range of issues being considered is the issue of patronage including the criteria that must be met to become a patron and the circumstances where changes to patronage may be warranted.Clearly, any implementation framework that is developed to facilitate the possible transfer of patronage would need to be planned and managed and it would be important in individual school cases for consultation to take place with all relevant stakeholders — parents, teachers and local communities.  In order to fully evaluate the model in different settings, I want to extend the community national school pilot to a number of new locations in 2010. The addition of what is likely to be a limited number of further schools to the pilot will enhance the potential for identifying possible practical issues and trying out new solutions and will enable informed decisions to be made on the further roll-out of this new model of patronage in other locations in the future.

Following an assessment process, projects will be selected for funding from all valid and approved applications on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria published with the Scheme.The timetable for the Summer Works Scheme 2010 has been published as part of the governing Circular Letter for the Scheme. This Circular Letter (0057/2009) is available on the Department's website www.education.ie.  In accordance with the timetable, it is my intention to publish a list of successful SWS applicants in the Spring.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	898	The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is designed to promote positive mental health. It is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide training and advice for schools and a resource directory.Its aim is to foster personal development, health and well being of children, to help them create and maintain supportive relationships, and develop the skills and attitudes for responsible citizenship. From the beginning of primary schooling children learn, in an age-appropriate way, how to identify, explore and express feelings and emotions, how to communicate with others, to resolve conflict and to respect difference, the importance of caring for one's body, treating oneself and others with dignity and respect, and how to identify people, places and situations that may threaten personal safety.The SPHE modules at junior cycle deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, bullying, dealing with peer pressure, coping with stress, emotional health and well being, influences on decision-making, and relationships and sexuality education. In third year, an awareness of the range of agencies who can help students in difficulty is promoted, as well as the skills of knowing when and how to seek help. SPHE is designed for implementation in the context of a caring whole-school approach which is supported by the pastoral care structures in schools.All post-primary schools also provide a guidance and counselling service for their students and they receive ex-quota hours from the Department for this provision. The service includes the provision of individual guidance and counselling for students either at critical stages in their education or at times of personal crisis.Schools also use Mental Health Matters, a resource pack on mental health for 14 to 18 year olds developed by Mental Health Ireland on an optional basis as a module in the Transition Year Programme, an element of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme, a component of the SPHE programme or an element of other subjects such as Religion or Home Economics.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) operating within my Department provides a range of services both direct and indirect which support the personal, social and educational development of all children in primary and post-primary schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	899	I wish to advise the Deputy that the policy underpinning the allocation of resource teacher and/or special needs assistant (SNA) posts has not been changed.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will continue to allocate additional teacher/SNA posts to schools in line with my Department's policy criteria.The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is at present carrying out a review of SNA allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts, as outlined in my Department's Circular 07/02, are properly met. This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left.SENOs are communicating the outcome of the review directly to schools as the review progresses. The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified. It is expected that the NCSE will have completed the review by the end of March 2010.I wish to assure the Deputy that additional teaching and/or SNA support will continue to be made available to schools, including those in Co Kildare, in line with current policy criteria.
