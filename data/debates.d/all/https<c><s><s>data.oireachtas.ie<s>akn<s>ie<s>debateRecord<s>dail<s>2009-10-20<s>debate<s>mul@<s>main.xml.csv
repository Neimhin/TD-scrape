#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.The Government has had extensive discussions with the social partners during the course of the year following the framework agreed with them on 28 January 2009.  Under that framework we agreed on the need to stabilise the public finances to achieve a reduction in the overall Government deficit to below 3% by 2013 through an appropriate combination of expenditure and taxation adjustments.  We also agreed on the need for a range of measures to stabilise the economy and minimise negative social impacts, including maximising economic activity and employment in the short term; stabilise the financial and banking sector; help those who lose their jobs; and address difficulties facing pensions schemes.  Extensive subsequent engagement since January has focused in large part on these elements.The Government published a series of measures reflecting these discussions on 23 June.  In that document, the Government indicated its wish to continue to engage with the social partners, in the context of the framework agreed in January, on measures to support national recovery.  Talks with the unions resumed last month in plenary session and a further round of bilateral engagement between management and unions in the various sectors has commenced.The National Implementation Body continues to meet as necessary to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions of the Towards 2016 review and transitional agreement .  Meetings of the body also provide the opportunity for the parties to the social partnership agreement to discuss informally pay and workplace matters under the agreement.  In recent months, the body was involved in assisting a number of parties, including the dispute in the electrical contracting sector.The reported rise in industrial unrest in recent months is a cause for concern and clearly underlines the importance of mobilising support for strategic action to build confidence and restore competitiveness.  The Government remains committed to engagement with the social partners to maximise support for the measures required for national recovery and to progress a range of issues, including support for enterprise, employment and competitiveness.The National Economic and Social Council published a report which again argues the case for an integrated approach that is seen to address each of the dimensions of our crisis in a coherent and logical fashion.  It emphasises that this is a matter for all economic and social actors, and not just for the Government.  In particular, it argues that this overall approach should be embedded in upcoming budgetary decisions and in fiscal policy in the coming years.  In response to the challenge set out in the report, the Government proposes to meet with the social partners to discuss whether there is sufficient basis to secure an agreed national response to the current economic crises.  The first of these meetings will take place this evening.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Taoiseach makes it sound as though the social partnership process is alive and well.  What is remarkable about the meeting this week with the social partners is that it appears to be the exception.  What is on the agenda for that meeting?  I appreciate that he cannot be specific, but can the Taoiseach broadly indicate what the Government will be putting to the social partners at the meeting?  In his opening remarks, he indicated that agreement was secured in January to meet certain targets on the public finances and to make adjustments to them.  There has been continued comment on the Government's intention to secure an adjustment of €4 billion in the forthcoming budget.  Does that remain the position?  What is the position with regard to the mix of measures that will make up that €4 billion?  I am referring here to expenditure cuts, taxation measures and the capital programme.  Does the Government intend to put any position to the social partners on pay and if so, what will it consist of in broad terms?When I asked the Taoiseach about the social partners in the summer, he informed me that the Government was announcing a new job subsidy scheme with an allocation of €250 million.  What progress has been made on the scheme?  What kind of applications have been made to it?  What moneys have been expended on it to date?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	2	It would be better for the Deputy to address the details of his latter questions to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.The discussions with the social partners are about meeting with them on the basis of the updated NESC report, which confirms that an integrated approach is needed to resolve the problems that we face.  Engaging with the social partners is not just a matter for the Government, but for everybody, because nobody can absent himself or herself from the responsibilities we now face.The breakdown of the manner in which the adjustment will be made across the various areas of expenditure is the subject of budgetary discussion at the moment.  We are going through the various Departments as we prepare for the December budget.  Like the leader of the Labour Party, we believe public sector pay and pensions need to be controlled.  In light of the scale of the adjustment that is necessary, reductions in those areas have to be part of the equation.  The manner in which that is achieved can be the subject of further discussions.  There is no doubt that the scale of adjustment is such that this issue cannot be avoided.The Deputy's third point related to the decisions and proposals that have been made.  He is aware that we have proposed a stabilisation fund.  Hundreds of firms have made applications under the subsidy scheme.  We changed the criteria for the percentage of a company's turnover that needs to relate to the export sector in line with a recommendation that had been made by Enterprise Ireland on that particular point.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Does the Government intend to put a position to the social partners in respect of pay?  The first issue that has to be addressed is pay in the public sector.  Will the Government put an actual proposal in that regard to the social partners?  Does the Government have a policy on the second issue that has to be addressed, which is pay in the private sector?  The Taoiseach referred to disputes that are threatened and are taking place.  I am sure he is concerned about the current tendency to ignore the recommendations of the Labour Court, for example, in the cases of Coca-Cola and Budget Travel.  A number of attempts have been made to resolve issues arising from the closure of travel shops by Budget Travel, which is a profitable company.  The company recently rejected the recommendations of the Labour Court.  Does the Taoiseach intend to make any observations or proposals to the social partners about the need for compliance with the industrial relations machinery of the country, in the interests of maintaining industrial peace?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Government will give an up-to-date assessment of its view on the current budgetary and fiscal challenges.  When one looks at public expenditure in general, one notes that, in broad terms, one third of public money is spent on social welfare and social services, one third is spent on public sector pay and pensions and one third is spent on the provision of services.  Our first aim is to try to stabilise the level of deficit that currently exists, in line with what we submitted to the European Commission on foot of our recent discussions with Commissioner Almunia.  Deputies will agree that such action is important not only for the sake of the finances and economy of this country, but also for the signal it sends to those who invest their funds.  Now that we have a large deficit, we need to show that we are prepared to take the necessary steps to effect national recovery more quickly than would otherwise be the case, without putting at risk many of the advances we have made.  Therefore, no area of expenditure is immune from consideration in this respect.We will put our assessment of the situation to the social partners.  We will hear what they have to say about that.  I am prepared to work with people on the basis that we have a job to do and a scaled adjustment to achieve.  I will listen to any ideas or views people may have about how best to achieve that adjustment in a way that minimises the impact on the delivery of services.  If we examine the situation as we have traditionally done during the Estimates process — by seeking savings in the context of the provision of services only, on the basis that the other budgetary areas are immune from consideration — we will have to require that aspect of the budget to take a very large adjustment.  That is not feasible in the present circumstances.  We want to make known our views on the best way forward based on the position we are in.  We want to do so in the spirit of partnership and social engagement, which are part of how we do our business.With regard to the question of recent industrial relations disputes – some private sector ones were mentioned – the Government does not condone the use of any improper or aggressive tactics by employers or trade unions in disputes.  They fly in the face of the positive industrial relations tradition that the Government, Congress and IBEC have worked so hard to nurture over many years.As the Deputy will know, we are committed to legislating in the context of the recently published Employment Agency Regulation Bill to prohibit the use of agency workers in cases of an official strike or lockout.  Discussions have been formally initiated as to how to give effect to the Government's commitments to legislate to prevent victimisation in the workplace on the grounds of union membership and to provide that those mechanisms put in place under the Industrial Relations Act 2004 can operate as originally intended.  The successful conclusion of that work will represent another important addition to the mix of voluntary and legislative frameworks for the protection of workers and the resolution of disputes.  Should it prove necessary, we will have an opportunity to monitor and further refine procedural arrangements and legislative obligations given our shared determination to defend the flexibility, responsiveness, impartiality and effectiveness of the existing industrial relations system.The Coca-Cola dispute was the subject of a Labour Court hearing on 18 September and the court issued a recommendation on 21 September.  It is centred on a decision by the company to outsource those remaining elements of its distributional warehousing operations, affecting some 130 of its employees at a number of sites around the country.  The company has declined to accept the court's recommendation in this case.  Subsequent clarification issued by the court in recent days has not changed the company's position.  A formal request has now been received from Congress for a meeting of the National Implementation Body in regard to the dispute.  No date for a meeting has been set as yet but I hope the parties can find the basis for an agreed settlement given their record of practical problem solving and generally good industrial relations heretofore.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's reply and noted he said we want to put our views forward on where we should go from here.  What does the Taoiseach want from the meeting with the social partners?  What views will he express on the way forward, as he sees it, given the circumstances in which we now find ourselves?  Does the Taoiseach propose to inform the social partners that it is the Government's intention to cut public sector pay?  If so, at what magnitude and above what level will the cuts apply?Is the Taoiseach happy in general with the way in which social partnership has operated?  Members on this side of the House have complained for some years that the last people to have had any information on what was happening within and around social partnership were the elected politicians, of all parties and none.  Is the Taoiseach, having been involved with social partnership for a number of years, happy that its structure is such that it has the capacity to deliver?  Although it has been very helpful for many years in stabilising a strategy for productivity and keeping at bay industrial unease, we are now in very different circumstances.  Can the current structure of social partnership deliver what the Taoiseach believes is necessary?  Will he comment on this?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Pay and pensions comprise a very considerable proportion of total public expenditure, as I have outlined in broad terms.  The severity of the funding crisis has already brought about a reduction in the numbers employed in the public service.  With colleagues retiring and taking career breaks, and with the moratorium on recruitment in place, there is wide recognition among staff and their representatives that the manner in which the public service conducts its business must be changed, with the further impetus to seek greater flexibility and productivity in all areas.The public service is no different from its private sector counterparts facing a crisis in their business.  In the private sector we have seen pay levels, pension arrangements, work practices and working patterns and hours featuring as part of the solution as employers, employees and union representatives work together in seeking to retain jobs and avoid redundancies.  The same is true of the public service.  Public servants have also experienced significant change in their net incomes as a result of the introduction of the pension levy.  I acknowledge that public servants at all levels have already demonstrated a capacity for change.  I believe staff can respond positively and with flexibility to the continuing challenge of managing our way through the current economic difficulties.There is a willingness by Government to engage at national and local level to bring about the changes that are needed.  The Government, as employer, must look at all the options which would minimise the impact on public services and public service jobs of unavoidable spending reductions.We have an objective.  We signalled on a number of occasions that the pay and pensions bill must be part of the equation.  We want to give our assessment of that and hear people's constructive views on how it might make a contribution to decisions.  The Government must reserve its position as an employer until it is clear how that contribution will manifest itself.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	7	It is important to state that public sector workers did not cause this crisis.  They have become a much maligned group.  Their value, capacity and potential is not being realised because of the structures in which they have to work.  I have been here for a number of years and my view is that the public servants will always respond to clear and decisive leadership and strong motivation.  They have that capacity to deliver.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that it is not the Government's intention to cut the pay of lower and middle income public sector workers?I am aware of hospital rooms which are filled with equipment which may never be used because it was purchased on invoices for times ahead in order to spend money allocated in Votes.  The same applies in a number of local authorities.  The structure within which the public sector must operate cannot deliver.Is it the Taoiseach's intention to spell out to social partnership how the Government proposes to re-start the economy by creating jobs and job opportunities?  Where does Government lie in that regard?  There is a range of activities, some published by Deputies Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, which would create a stimulus to protect and generate jobs and get people back to work.  Does the Taoiseach intend to spell out to the social partners the value of listening to what the Government has to say?  What are the Government's job creation and job protection targets in the period ahead?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Deputy Kenny knows the scale of the public finances crisis which confronts the country.  Stabilising next year's deficit requires a considerable adjustment.  Is it his contention that there are swathes of the population who can be immune from contributing to the necessary adjustment?  If so, that is not a fair, comprehensible or accurate assessment of the situation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The Taoiseach said he wants to put the Government's views before the people.  I am asking him what they are.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Deputy Kenny suggests that there are swathes of people who could be immune from contributing.  I simply make the point that the situation we face in terms of the public finances requires that every area of public expenditure on all fronts has to be considered.  All areas of the public sector have to be considered.  One acknowledges the role the public service plays in our society.  Public service employers are the same as private sector employers.  Based on the resources that are coming into the coffers we must examine how we can make an adjustment over a period of years, not overnight, and at the same time do so in a way that closes the gap between revenue and expenditure, which at the moment is running in the order of €500 million a week.  That is the situation.  It is important that one looks at every area of public expenditure.On the pay and pensions side of the equation we will look at all ways in which that can be achieved.  We will listen to what others have to say about that.  The suggestion that there are large categories which can be immune from consideration would not allow one to draw up the sort of budget that would meet the imperative in the situation that we face.On job creation and competitiveness, a fundamental part of that must be the stabilisation of the public finance position of the country.  Without that, one puts at risk the return of confidence to the economy.  There is a need to be seen to do it and to demonstrate that one is prepared to do it in the long-term interests of the economy.  That is vital in the present circumstances.  The Government is working to the objective.  On our part we continue our effort to improve the prospects of not only maintaining jobs in the economy but to create them again in the future.  Jobs are being created in this economy despite the severity of the recession, but more jobs have been lost than gained in the past 12 months.  Thankfully, we have seen a levelling off in the rate of job losses.  That is to be welcomed in itself.Again, it is an indication that we have to reinforce our efforts to put a floor on our public finance position which would enable us to grow and invest again.  It is clear from all of the analysis that has been done that next year will be a difficult year but one which should see growth return to the economy in the latter part of the year based on current assumptions and best analysis of world trends as things stand.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	11	What is the position in so far as voluntary redundancies in the public sector are concerned?  That was mentioned by the Minister for Health and Children on a number of occasions in respect of her Department, and other Ministers in respect of theirs.  The Fine Gael Party has spelled out its views about cutting the costs of the public sector on many occasions.  What is the position in respect of voluntary redundancies?  Is that part of the view the Taoiseach will express to the social partners?  It was indicated that all of the sectors are not immune.  However, I understand that less than 50% of members of the Judiciary voluntarily handed back remuneration.  How does the Taoiseach propose to deal with the situation where he does not want to create an isolated elite if all sectors are to be included and that sector is protected by articles in the Constitution?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	12	It is important to point out that we look to all sections of the community to make a contribution, but we also have to do so in a way that respects and is consistent with the constitutional independence of the Judiciary.  I hope and believe that will all be demonstrated in due course to be the case.  I do not wish to enter into a controversy with any particular section of the community.  My job as Taoiseach is to outline in full the present position, which requires everybody, according to their means and abilities, to make a contribution to the situation.  The Government is not in a position to say that one third, two thirds or three quarters of public expenditure cannot be considered in the context of finding the necessary moneys to effect the adjustment that is necessary.  It would be too great a burden on the provision of services to do that.  That is my honest assessment of the position.  Further efficiencies and effectiveness can be obtained through a variety of measures, including redeployment, controlling numbers and having more flexibilities in the system.  There are many mechanisms which can be considered that would assist in arriving at a contribution that would come from the public sector pay and pension bill.  The Government has to reserve its position to make sure that the ultimate contribution it gets is fair and equitable in all the circumstances given the other areas of expenditure we have to consider.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Will the Taoiseach agree that any form of social partnership agreement is worthless unless it deals with the actual conditions people face in their workplaces?  Will he also agree that there is no so-called social partnership where a system allows workers, in particular the workers in Coca-Cola and dockers previously employed by Marine Terminals Limited, to be treated in the way they have been treated?  Will he join me in deploring the actions of Coca-Cola HBC Ireland management in sacking its workers on 8 September last while they were on the picket line?  Does he recognise the wider implications for all workers and for industrial relations in the State of the outsourcing by Coca-Cola of the jobs of 130 SIPTU members at the warehousing and distribution centres in Dublin, Cork, Tipperary, Waterford and Tuam?  Will he further deplore — I did not hear him say this when answering questions earlier — the company's failure to abide by the Labour Court's findings and the company's determination, despite it being a highly profitable one, to dump jobs and to drive down wages and conditions?  Will he join me in commending South Dublin County Council which, on the proposal of a former Deputy, Councillor Seán Crowe, voted to boycott all Coca-Cola products until the dispute is settled?  All parties, including the Taoiseach's, supported that motion.  Will the Taoiseach join me in making the same call for the Houses of the Oireachtas to boycott Coca-Cola products as a symbol of our determination to ensure the labour relations mechanisms are upheld in Ireland given the times we are in?Will the Taoiseach also deplore the actions of Marine Terminals Limited, which is implementing forced redundancies and introducing new "take it or leave it" contracts, reducing wages and severely worsening the working conditions in this area?  Is he aware that more than 60 workers have been on strike there for a number of months and that the management has imported scab labour and heavy handed security from Britain to try to enforce its vision of social partnership?  What value is social partnership if employers can act with impunity in these ways?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	14	As I said in an earlier response on this matter, it is important to point out that the seven social partnership agreements we have had have helped to provide the stability and the means by which society generally has progressed, not only in terms of wage and remuneration or pay issues between employers and employees but in terms of the wider social policy advancements that have been made on the basis of the social partnership framework.  It has been an excellent success in that respect.  It has brought many improvements to working people's lives for many years.  Many of the advances in terms of greater take home pay, better terms and conditions of employment, and better and more widely available opportunities for working families and their children, in terms of education provision and in all other respects, have been as a result of a commitment by the social partners to the process.Of course it involves compromises and having to work out shared objectives, but, at the end of the day, there is no doubt that, as a governance mechanism, it has proven itself to be a good way in which to organise interests in this society.  This includes those contributing not only in respect of their own expertise or area of involvement, whether as trade unions, farm and business organisations or as the voluntary pillar, but also in terms of being able to get a wider and shared understanding of how the economy works and how best to achieve the objectives to which people give priority in that context.  I honestly believe it has been a good process.That does not excuse in particular cases — there is both a statutory and a voluntarist arrangement in industrial relations — aggressive or improper tactics being used by employers or trade unions in respect of the resolution of disputes.  On the specific issues Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised, I indicated that the National Implementation Body has been asked to take up the Coca-Cola case and to hold a meeting to see how we can help resolve that problem in a way that is consistent with best practice in industrial relations.  From my point of view, there is a need for everyone to take responsibility for respecting the frameworks, which have been built up over the years and to which everyone has subscribed.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	15	There are two matters on which I want clarification.  First, in respect of the adjustment in the public finances, the figure of €4 billion has been the accepted wisdom so far.  I understand it was the figure sent by the Government to the European Commission and it was also the figure referred to by the Minister for Finance in the supplementary budget last April.  Is that still the Government's target or is there a different figure?  The Government has stated publicly that its objective is to achieve a €4 billion adjustment.  Does the broad configuration of that €4 billion, which the Minister for Finance mentioned in the supplementary budget last April, still apply?The second issue on which I want clarification is public sector pay.  Regarding the Taoiseach's meetings with the social partners, is it his intention to try to secure agreement with the social partners on how the public sector pay bill might be reduced?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	16	First, the figure of adjustment we believe is required is in the order of €4 billion, given that at present we are seeking to stabilise, let alone reduce, the deficit position for next year vis-à-vis this year.  This is an important point to make.On the question of the public sector pay bill, as I have stated, we believe that is an area of public expenditure from which a contribution will have to be made towards making that adjustment and we are anxious to discuss with social partners how that can be best achieved, while recognising that it must be achieved.  We are prepared to discuss with the social partners their views on that matter while, at the same time, noting, as an employer must, the fact that there is a contribution to be made from that side of the equation which cannot be avoided.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Earlier, the Taoiseach mentioned the recent reports from the National Economic and Social Council.  It is fair to say that its analysis is valuable and I am interested to know whether the Taoiseach agrees with it — that there is a five-part crisis, namely, a fiscal crisis, a jobs and competitiveness crisis, a social crisis, a reputational crisis and a banking crisis.  Does the Taoiseach agree with that analysis?Second, does he agree with the reports' analysis that, to date, the Government's actions in this regard have been compartmentalised and sequential?  Part of the criticism made is that the Government has addressed the banking issue as if it is a separate issue without looking at how it impacts socially on people in difficulty with their mortgages or in debt and that the Government is dealing with the fiscal crisis as a bookkeeping exercise without considering how it affects employment.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the analysis by the National Economic and Social Council in terms of there being a five-part crisis and with its criticism that to date, the Government's approach to the crisis has not been integrated?While the National Economic and Social Council has put forward a coherent analysis it has not put forward serious and realistic propositions in terms of how each of the five issues can be addressed.  However, analysis is easy and solutions are difficult.  Given that all the social partners are involved in that forum has the Taoiseach considered asking NESC to come up with proposals in regard to how the five issues could be addressed in an integrated way?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The analysis we received from NESC earlier this month follows its analysis provided in January which fed into the February framework.  It also provided further analysis in March.  The Government recognises that there are many facets to this problem.  The analysis also makes the fundamental point that this matter is not alone the responsibility of Government but of all economic and social actors in society who must come together to find a nationally supported way forward.  We have been seeking to achieve this through the framework process agreed in February, an obvious imposition of which was the pension levy for which there was not agreement.  However, that necessary and urgent decision had to be taken and was confirmed, in terms of its impact, in respect of the reputation of our country in regard to bond issues and so on.I do not accept that the critique is fundamentally against the Government.  The analysis points out that there is a need for all aspects of the crisis to be addressed.  Getting agreement in this regard is always a problem.  There has been much analysis.   In June, we introduced measures through which we are seeking to assist on the skills and training front, including the stabilisation scheme and the employment subsidy scheme.  Also, the number of available places for training and upskilling has doubled since 2008, up from 66,000 to 130,000.There has been a response from Government in all areas.  On the financial front, the issue to be debated in this House in the coming weeks is part of that response.  We believe the National Asset Management Agency legislation is the means by which we can do this.  Again, the response by markets to its publication and progress has been positive.  The final issue is the budget and how that will be addressed.  While there are many views in this House in regard to what should be the scale of adjustments the Government is of the view that if we are to effect a quick recovery we must avoid prolonging the crisis in our public finances, with all of the attendant difficulties that brings with it.  While we have a high deficit and a relatively low debt, although rising quickly, we may quickly end up in a situation whereby we could move from debt interest at 4% to 11.5% to 20% by 2013, which would be a huge drain on the capacity of this country to deliver services given the great shortfall in our tax revenue position during the past two fiscal years.I can understand why people might put forward a proposition that there is perhaps a different way of approaching this.  However, I am of the view that we need to take decisions which lessen the prospect of that increase of debt interest as a percentage of what we are collecting in terms of revenue as this could impact in an adverse way our ability to fund services.  That, in many respects, is the dilemma and difficulty we face.  By the same token we must look at what it is we need to do, taking everything into account, including what is being said by the EU and European Central Bank, which has been helpful throughout the current crisis.  From our own point of view, we must avoid a situation where we deflect more of a reducing resource towards interest on debt rather than addressing the debt issue itself, which means making a significant adjustment in the first couple of years.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The revised programme for Government provides for a number of specific measures in the education sector, including a commitment to no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio for the lifetime of the Government; 500 teaching posts over the next three years; funding for 28 additional psychologist posts; standard capitation grants to schools being maintained and an extra allocation being made available to schools for needs such as book rental schemes and curricular activities.The commitment to maintain the standard capitation grants to schools will not give rise to additional costs except in so far as it relates to increases in the schoolgoing population, the costing of which would form part of the annual Estimates and budgetary process.  While the precise costs of the additional teaching posts cannot be determined until the actual appointments are made it is anticipated that every teacher appointed will give rise to an initial annual pay cost of approximately €46,000 on appointment rising to an average of €64,000 over time.Assuming 200 extra teachers from the beginning of next year and a further 150 teachers next September, the extra pay costs next year will be in the order of €11 million, and the ongoing full year pay cost when all 500 teachers are employed at average salary will be in the order of €32 million.  The funding of the additional 28 psychologist posts is expected to give rise to an additional full year cost of approximately €2.3 million.  The exact level of additional funding for schools for the consolidated grants will be considered in the context of the Estimates and budgetary process.The revised programme also provides for other measures which have the potential to give rise to additional costs for the education sector.  These include delivery of 100MBs broadband for all second level schools by 2012 and roll out of new digital access devices for teachers and students.  In addition it provides for the development of a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, focusing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs.It is not possible, however, to give an exact costing on these issues at this early stage until the implementation arrangements are worked out.  As the Deputy is aware the revised programme for Government is for delivery over the period to 2012.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I find it astonishing that the Minister cannot conclusively inform the House of the total cost of the revised programme for Government for his Department given that the alleged parties to the deal had such a long time to negotiate it.Will the Minister give a specific answer to the following question?  In the 24 hours following the publication of the revised programme for Government, three Cabinet Ministers refused to give an absolute guarantee to the public that college registration fees, which were massively increased last year from €900 to €1,500, would not undergo such a hike again this year.  Will the Minister now give a categorical assurance in this House that he does not intend to increase college registration fees in the upcoming budget?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The first thing is that we must understand to what the registration fee refers.  It refers to the services delivered by the universities and institutes of education to students.  The Government decided last year that the universities and institutes could charge up to €1,500 per student on the basis that they were delivering that level of service.  Until then it was felt that the full cost of services was not being borne by the student.  In those circumstances, a ceiling was set and the universities and institutes, liaising with the Higher Education Authority and ourselves, gave a clear outline of the services they were rendering.  It is, therefore, a matter for the Higher Education Authority and sector and the Department of Education and Science to determine what level of service exists.  If a level of service beyond €1,500 is not being delivered by the higher level institutions, we cannot increase the registration charge.

He gave a very interesting Second Stage type speech on college registration fees, but he did not answer my question.  I will try putting the question again.  Will the Minister give the House a categorical assurance, "Yes" or "No", that he will not increase college registration fees in the context of the upcoming budget?  Will the Minister confirm for the House whether the universities and institutes of technology have sought an increase in college registration fees in the run-up to the budget?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I know exactly what it is about.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I am not aware that third level institutes or universities have, up to now, requested an increase in the registration fee.  However, all these issues are budgetary matters that will be determined by Government when dealing with the Estimates.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 107 together.The published expenditure figures show that my Department's capital expenditure to the end of September is €455 million, which is €112 million behind the profiled or projected figure of €568 million.My Department's total budget in 2009 for primary, post-primary and third level capital is €841 million.  Expenditure on the large number of individual projects included in a capital programme of this magnitude is subject to very considerable variation on a calendar year basis.  It was in recognition of this that the current framework of rolling multi-annual capital envelopes, encompassing a carry-over facility of up to 10% of the total amount available in any one year, was introduced.The principal area where expenditure is running behind profile is schools' major capital projects.  These projects comprise new schools, major extensions and refurbishment projects.  The main reason for the underspend against profile on the major schools' capital projects is that my announced programme of 78 projects to commence construction in 2009 has been slower to get started on site than initially expected.  Another significant factor is that tender prices obtained for this programme are yielding a reduction of up to 30% compared to prices obtained at the height of the construction boom.The position regarding the re-tendering of school projects is that, on 29 September 2008, I announced 25 projects to progress to tender and construction.  My Department received a derogation from the Department of Finance to proceed with five projects which had previously been tendered under the old form of public contract.  These five projects commenced on site within a matter of weeks of my announcement.  One is already complete and the other four are due to be completed shortly.  Six more of these projects are under construction, six are at tendering stage and the remainder, which are at pre-tendering stage, will be progressed to site as soon as possible.Some 20 of the projects I announced in September, along with a further 53 that I announced in January and February of 2009, were required to have associated documentation prepared or amended to comply with the new form of contract.  Of these 53 projects, eight are already under construction or at completion stage and 21 have already been tendered and are expected to commence on site before the end of this year or early in 2010.  The remaining 24 projects will go on site in 2010, as soon as the tendering and contract formalities have been completed.In addition, an extensive programme of smaller-scale schools' capital projects is being delivered, mainly through the summer works scheme which this year includes an energy efficiency component for which in excess of 1,500 schools have now been approved.  Also, there is a significant amount of capital expenditure in the programme for the remainder of 2009.  Expenditure trends in recent years bear out the fact that an increased amount of invoices and other claims for payment are made in the final quarter as builders complete projects and schools draw down their capital grant approvals.I am keeping the position under close review and considering all appropriate options regarding the expenditure position.  These options include the possibility of carrying forward funding into 2010.  As I have already mentioned, if necessary, and in agreement with the Minister for Finance, up to 10% of the overall allocation of €841 million can be carried forward to 2010.Since I became Minister for Education and Science, I have consistently emphasised my determination to ensure value for money in capital projects and that the available funding is spent in a prudent way.  I am particularly pleased to note the 30% reduction in tender costs for capital projects.  I intend to continue to maximise value for money and to ensure that as many schools as possible will benefit from the very favourable tenders that can now be obtained in the construction sector.  In this context, my Department is currently finalising a further programme of major capital projects for 2010, which I will announce in due course.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Minister provided a significant amount of information in his response.  I will try to focus on some of the headline parts and we can return on another day to other elements.  Will the Minister and the Department recognise we face a threefold crisis?  First, we have a crisis in terms of student numbers, which are growing exponentially; the highest birth rate since 1896 was recorded this year.  Second, we have an already overcrowded school system and, third, we have a crisis in employment and in the construction industry sector.  Is it not time to think outside the box and consider invoking the strategic infrastructure legislation where planning permissions are a problem, although the Minister has not said that they are and nor do I have evidence that they are?Is it not essential to accelerate the building programme?  The Construction Industry Federation and the schools' management authorities would say they cannot get a response from Tullamore quick enough to deal with the problems that confront them.  I note from the Minister's response that he has made progress on some projects, but progress is slow relative to the demand in the construction industry for more work and its willingness to get started.  If the Minister and Department officials in Tullamore are suggesting that builders are sitting on invoices and not submitting them because they are flush with cash, I suggest they should enter the real world.  That is not the case.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	31	We are anxious to ensure that when we announce a project, it goes to construction as soon as possible.  There are two reasons for the difficulty this year.  One is the new form of contract.  As the Deputy knows, these new contracts transferred major liability onto whoever was doing the construction.  This new format created a difficulty in architectural and other offices with regard to interpretation of the contract.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	32	They had plenty of time to interpret them.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The difficulty was such that we invited them to Tullamore to brief them and outline to them what was required.  This caused a delay in its own right.I would like to see the projects up and running.  However, the Deputy should understand there has been significant activity on the ground and it is only the major projects that are being held up.  The summer works scheme, for example,——
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I have no problem in that regard.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	35	It is important for me to outline how the Department has moved ahead with over 1,200 summer works projects.  The energy efficiency scheme has 1,500 projects up and running.  All the devolved small local schemes are up and running and on schedule.While some of the bigger projects have been delayed, we are quite happy that the amount of money we have set aside for them will be required and there will be a carry-over into 2010.  That is normal.  Looking at the profile up to the end of the year, I see we will have substantial spending before the year ends on the major projects.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I do not want to go over the ground covered by Deputy Quinn, but the Minister has tried to tell us that the reason the major projects are slower has to do with the new contract or tendering processes.  I am somewhat confused as to why there should be such a hold up that almost half of the money has not been spent.  I suppose it makes a change for us to be discussing money that was made available and not spent, but there is a great deal of confusion in all our constituencies as a result of the figures that were released a few weeks ago.  The Minister visited my constituency last May, for instance, and met many delegations.  He basically told people that he found it difficult to honour the commitments that had been made by his predecessor.  There is also the question of more than €100 million being spent on prefabs because money was not available for permanent buildings, and this has confused the situation.I have a couple of questions for the Minister.  Will this money be lost or will it be put in as part of the capital programme for next year?  In other words, will a sleight of hand be done as regards the programme for building, next year, and what measures does the Minister envisage taking to ensure this does not happen?  It is difficult for us to explain the situation to boards of management where the schools are falling in around them.  I have had plenty of offers in the past week, as I am sure every Deputy has, from interested parties to the effect that they will show the Minister how to spend the half a billion if he does not know how.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I am glad of the opportunity to be able to expand on what has been said here.  I have saved something in the region of €14 million already on prefabs so far this year compared to last year.  We are delighted with these savings.  I introduced an initiative which gives the option of erecting a permanent structure as against a prefab, and 159 schools have taken up the option.  A classroom can now be built for less than €100,000.  Two classrooms today cost €132,000, so there is outstanding value for money to be had.We started the year believing we might, perhaps, get a saving of 15%, and we now have 30%.  Therefore I was able to increase the number of summer work schemes and the amount of money put into energy conservation as well as putting €30 million into minor works in schools to enhance the environment.  We are doing an outstanding job, I believe, this year.  The only area in which we have a difficulty is in the larger projects.  The Deputy asked whether we will spend the money, and of course we will.  We were allowed a derogation of 10%.  My total budget was over €841 million, therefore I could carry forward those projects that were not completed in 2009 and finish them in 2010.  That is what I intend to do, and I emphasise I will not be giving any money back to the Exchequer.  All that money will be spent on the projects as outlined.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The Minister, in his supplementary response, said that 159 schools had opted for a permanent as distinct from a prefab structure.  Will he make those details available?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Yes, I will.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	40	A total of 850 primary teachers have retired on pension to date in 2009 and the corresponding figure for secondary, community and comprehensive schools is 738.Within the overall total, 253 principals have retired from primary schools while 68 principals have retired from secondary, community and comprehensive schools.  Deputy principal retirements total 260 of which 208 were primary and 52 were from secondary, community and comprehensive schools.Also within the overall total, assistant principals account for 588 retirements of whom 132 retired from primary schools and 456 from secondary, community and comprehensive schools.  Some 171 teachers with special duties posts retired from primary schools while 104 retired from secondary, community and comprehensive schools.While these figures do not include retirements in the VEC sector for which my Department does not have figures as they are not on the payroll, there has been a significant increase in retirement numbers in this sector also.  Teachers who have the requisite service or reached a specified age threshold are required to give three months notice to the board of management of their school of their intention to retire.The vast majority of teachers choose to retire before reaching mandatory retirement age.  This year some 88% of primary school retirements and 84% of secondary, community and comprehensive school retirements fall into this category.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I thank the Minister for his reply.  He has just put an extraordinary fact on the record.  If one takes the post-primary sector for example, he has just told the House that one principal in every school effectively retired in the first ten months of this year.  If that is not a flight from the profession, I am not sure what is.  That is a very serious loss of senior and middle management within the education system, as I am sure he will accept.  While it could be argued that this creates opportunities for younger teachers to take on new posts, there is an issue of concern here, given the importance of leadership within our schools, particularly at primary and post-primary levels.Will the Minister tell the House the expected cost to his Department this year from the retirements to date?  Has he been in discussion with the principals' associations at primary and post-primary levels to inquire why so many people are leaving the education system?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	42	There is no doubt that the numbers are much higher than in previous years, and we carried out a survey to find out why.  It showed that approximately half of those retiring gave "planned retirement" as their main reason, one third highlighted concerns about future taxation of their lump sum and the impact of recent levies and the remainder tended to cite general reasons such as lifestyle etc., and wanted an opportunity to avail of the good life in retirement rather than continue teaching.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	43	It is quite clear that the doubt that exists as regards the taxation of the lump sum is a real issue for many principals.  I would encourage the Minister to clarify that issue with his Government colleagues once and for all.Where a principal or deputy principal retires, the position is advertised and a new person is placed.  However, when it comes to assistant principals, or teachers with special duties, since there is a moratorium on appointments those positions are not fed back into the system.  According to the information that the Minister has just given Dáil Éireann, 456 assistant principals have retired this year in the first ten months, and those posts are not being filled.  It effectively means that their duties are being taken up by other teachers.  It means the posts of those teachers who had special duty responsibilities in terms of games, debates, music or whatever are not being taken up this year.Will the Minister please look at the moratorium issue again on the basis that it is causing enormous problems not only in the post-primary but also in the primary sector?  Could he also put the answer to my first question on the record of the House, namely how much this will cost his Department this year?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I do not appear to have those figures although I have costings for teachers in various circumstances.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	45	That detail was not included in the original question, so the Minister would not be expected to have the data to hand.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I shall provide that information for the Deputy.  As regards the moratorium, as he knows we have a system in place whereby a principal or deputy principal can be replaced.  That is a special concession that does not apply to other sectors of the public service.  We ask schools to prioritise and reorganise posts that cannot be filled.Some 50% of all teachers have a post of responsibility, it should be remembered.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	47	That is nearly like the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	48	That has changed.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	49	That has changed totally as the Deputy knows — it is a new regime.The percentage of teachers retiring, therefore, is very small and we hope that given the circumstances that prevail schools will be able to juxtapose various posts to ensure all the important elements will be reorganised and people are transferred, as appropriate.  I do not envisage looking for a derogation in this particular school year.  However, if particular problems arise in a school where there are a major number of retirements that gives rise to serious concern, obviously I would be prepared to look at such a situation.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Is the Minister concerned about this?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I am not concerned, as there are enough posts of responsibility.  There is enough flexibility within the schools so that they can reorganise, and it will be successful.Question No. 107 answered with Question No. 105.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	52	My colleagues in Government and I recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos.  I have met representatives of the Church of Ireland, the Grand Orange Lodge and a rural Protestant fee-paying school.  I will meet representatives of the Protestant education sector tomorrow.The representations I have received have focused on two aspects of the budget changes.  First was the allocation of teachers to all fee-charging schools.  By making the changes to the pupil-teacher ratio, the Government recognised that such schools, regardless of religious ethos, have extra income which they can use and have used to employ additional teachers.  If I had not made this change, I would have been faced with making a more severe change to the staffing position of all schools.  I believe the measures that differentiated between those schools with fee income and those without were fairer all round.  The case being put to me is that this change should not apply to Protestant fee-charging schools.The second aspect is the withdrawal of certain grants that had been paid to Protestant fee-charging schools that were not paid to Catholic fee-charging schools.  The argument being put to me is that the grants should be restored.  I have emphasised that the Government decided to continue to provide the block grant, which was increased this year.  It is targeted as a support to individual pupils to enable them to attend Protestant schools.Article 44 of the Constitution permits State aid to denominational schools, but only on the basis that there be no discrimination between schools under different religious management.  The advice of the Attorney General has been provided on the interpretation of this provision and I am satisfied that the budget changes are consistent with the Constitution.From the discussions I have had, I am aware that the funding position of Protestant fee-charging schools in many areas may be more difficult than the position of Protestant fee-charging schools in Dublin.  I have consistently said I am willing to consider any proposals that would more effectively focus funding on schools in rural areas.  I have still to receive any such proposals.  Any proposals and how precisely they are targeted will need to be considered having regard to the constitutional requirement.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Is it not fair to say that the Minister is on a direct collision course with the Protestant faith in this country and that his handling of this issue has been utterly insensitive to Protestant schools and the ethos provided in those schools?  When the then Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, introduced free post-primary education in the 1960s he did a deal with them.  The Minister is breaking that deal and is doing so in the most insensitive way.  He is doing it in a way that does not bring people with him and that loses confidence in his position as Minister for Education and Science.  The Minister needs to deal with this issue once and for all.  He has been putting canards into the public domain that in some way there is legal advice that he had to act upon this.  For 40 years their situation was protected within Irish education.  Since the budget of last year the Minister is undermining that.  He is undermining their confidence in the Government's position in terms of denominational education and the rights of those 21 schools.Schools will go to the wall, particularly Protestant schools in rural parts of the country unless he shows some flexibility and meets people half way.  To date the misinformation he has put out first, that moneys existed in budgets that were not spent and, second, in respect of legal opinion that had never been sought in the past 40 years has resulted in a terrible loss of faith in his position as Minister for Education and Science among the minority community.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I am pleased to inform the Deputy so as to ensure he understands exactly what is happening.  I have treated the Protestant bishops and any other group who have met me with the respect and fairness due to them and certainly the equity that was desired.  This answer has been cleared by the Attorney General.  He believes that to continue the grant that was available would be unconstitutional because it was being given to the Protestant denomination and being refused to the Catholic denomination.The Deputy accused me of breaking what was an agreement between the then Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, and the Protestant churches.  I say to him that I am not breaching that agreement.

That block grant continues to this day.  It is important that I further advise the Deputy that the grant that is made available to the Protestant schools amounts to €645 per pupil.  The grant available to ordinary second level schools is €345.  They are in a more privileged position.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	59	There is a reason for it.

When I took away this grant, the Protestant bishops agreed with me that they had €2 million in the education committee's coffers that was not spent and that was derived from this grant.  In the interim period I asked them to use that money to defray any difficulties that exist and come back to me with a scheme that would look at the Dublin and general urban situation where money is more freely available to families with a view to targeting together those rural schools that are experiencing problems.  That was last November and we are now in October, and I am still waiting for the Protestant community to come back with its observations.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The Minister has a difficulty in reading the newspapers and in communicating with these people.  If he is in constant communication with them, is he not aware that the Church of Ireland, the Methodist community in Ireland and the Presbyterian Church have publicly asked him to reverse these cuts as late as two weeks as ago?  Regarding the Catholic fee-paying schools, the Minister said that he would be discriminating against one church in favour of the other.  I suspect he is also unaware of the following point, because he barely understands the detail of this.  When representatives of the sector appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science, those representing the Catholic schools made it clear that they had no difficulty in allowing the 21 Protestant schools continuing to have those grants because they respected the position that had historically come down from the time of the introduction of free education in the 1960s.The Minister has continually put misinformation in the public domain about this issue, which has not been helped by his less than sensitive remarks today.  I suggest that he needs to get this right.  He is on a collision course that has considerable implications across the island, North and South.  Before he goes down the route of seeking confrontation he should think again.

I refer the Deputy back to an occasion when the then Minister, Deputy Martin, was challenged by the Deputy's party on an issue in the health sector.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	73	In the 2008-09 year, modern European languages were taught in 505, or 15%, of our primary schools as part of an initiative that was introduced by my Department in September 1998.  The aims of this initiative include the development of communication skills in a modern European language, the fostering of positive attitudes to language learning and the diversification of the languages taught in our schools.  In the participating schools, the pupils in fifth and sixth classes are taught one of four languages – French, German, Italian or Spanish.  The dedicated support structure for the teachers in the schools concerned has been in place since the initiative was implemented.  Teachers in the initiative schools implement a language competence model, based on draft curriculum guidelines that were provided by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.The NCCA has recommended against a further expansion of the language competence model at this time, citing issues of curriculum overload and difficulties relating to the ability to replicate the model across the system.  It has recommended instead, in the short to medium term, that a strategy of language awareness should be promoted, with pupils continuing to begin their formal learning of a modern language at the start of second level.  Such an approach involves engaging the child in reflecting on how language is learned, on similarities and differences between known and unknown languages and the conventions of language.  However, the NCCA report approach does not preclude the use by schools of a competence model where this is feasible.The NCCA advice is set out in the context of the changing landscape in Irish primary schools since the primary modern languages initiative was first introduced in 1998.  The key factors relate to the feedback on curriculum overload which is a strong feature of the evaluation of phases 1 and 2 of implementation of the revised primary curriculum, the challenges highlighted in reports on language learning in Irish and English, the particular issues relating to literacy in disadvantaged schools, and the new needs which have emerged in providing additional English language support for newcomer children.  Given the difficult budgetary position, and particularly in the context of the advice from the NCCA, there will be no expansion of the modern languages initiative at primary level in the near term.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	74	If the Minister of State is informing the House that 15% of schools have access to this programme, it means 85% of schools have no access to it.  Is it still the intention of the Government to put into effect an agreement signed under the Barcelona agreement whereby the Government gave a firm commitment that by 2010 all primary school students would have access to the opportunity to learn a modern language in fifth or sixth class?  Does the Minister of State stand over that commitment?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Barcelona conclusions are non-binding——

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	77	——and express the views and intentions of the European Council.  Individual member states are invited to adopt the approaches set out in the conclusions in so far as is appropriate for their particular national priorities, circumstances and resources.  My Department fully accepts the desirability of this approach as an EU policy direction.  This does not mean, however, that it is necessarily practicable in every member state.The modern language initiative was introduced to expand modern language teaching into a selected range of primary schools for fifth and sixth class pupils.  It has grown from 270 participating schools when it began to 505 schools during the 2008-09 school year.  In Ireland, where two national languages, Irish and English, are given recognition under the Constitution, both of these languages are taught at primary level.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I am disappointed with the Minister of State's reply and also with the complacency associated with it.  There are many other European countries which have two languages, for example, Catalan and Spanish in Catalonia, Spain, and there are two languages in Belgium.  We are woefully behind most continental countries in regard to having a second language as part and parcel of our integrated curriculum.  Can the Minister of State given any indication of when the Government will revert to the spirt of the Barcelona agreement as distinct from the letter of the law?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	79	As I said initially, I must be very conscious of the advice given by the NCCA.  I must also be conscious of the budgetary situation as it is estimated that to extend this initiative nationwide could cost up to €28 million.  It is also worth noting that English is the most widely studied language in upper second level education across the EU other than the mother tongue.  The fact that all Irish people speak English can be a disincentive to the learning of other languages, just as it is often difficult to promote the learning of languages other than English in other European member states.  When English is omitted, a dramatically different picture emerges of language learning across Europe.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Minister of State has explained to the Dáil that the Barcelona agreement is non-binding, although the Government stated that by 2010 we would move to a system whereby all primary school children would have access to another modern European language.  Is he prepared to put on record a new date upon which all children can be expected to have such a service in our primary schools?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I have dealt with that question.  There is a policy in regard to modern European languages and I could outline what is taking place at post-primary level as well.  At the end of the day, we have studied this initiative and the NCCA has undertaken an assessment of it.  In its view, due to the whole issue of curriculum overload in particular, it does not recommend an extension of this initiative.  I cannot accede to the Deputy's request.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The revised programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of the Government.  Under the revised programme, we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years.  These posts will be allocated to the schools that are most seriously affected by the recent increase in the pupil-teacher ratio, using objective criteria which will be agreed in advance in consultation with the education partners.I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority.  The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.The Deputy will also be aware that there has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years.  There are now approximately 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs.  This includes over 10,000 special needs assistants, SNAs, compared to just 300 in 1997.  There are over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools compared to just 2,000 in 1998.  Over 1,000 other teachers support pupils in our special schools.  Significant investment has also taken place for pupils with special needs in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment.  Additional teaching and SNA supports will continue to be allocated as necessary by the National Council for Special Education in line with my Department's policy to support children with special educational needs.In the 2009 budget, additional funding of €10 million was allocated to the Health Service Executive for 125 additional therapy posts in disability and mental health services.  Some €7.2 million of this funding will provide for 90 additional therapy posts in the disability services area.  These posts will be targeted at children of school-going age and will include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists.Additional information not given on the floor of the House:The HSE will continue to work with funded specialist providers and in co-operation with the education sector to address the health-related needs of children with special educational needs in the context of the resources available.The Deputy will also be cognisant of the Government's commitment to continue the expansion in the number of psychologists employed directly by NEPS, most recently reiterated in the revised programme for Government.  This will allow for the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to every primary and post-primary school in the country and for the deepening of support therein with particular emphasis on special needs units, classes and special schools.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	83	In the context of the revised programme for Government, what is the breakdown, for each of the three years involved, between primary and second level in regard to the allocation of the proposed 500 extra teachers?With regard to the pupil-teacher ratio, every national school I know of in east Galway has an increased ratio and larger class sizes, some as large as 35 which had just 24 pupils last year, due to the loss of teachers.  This can be merely because they were one student under the required number, which is totally unfair to the schools involved.With regard to the psychological service, I wish to refer to the comments of a teaching principal who wrote to me in recent weeks.  He stated:The NEPS service is terrible.  Last week I tried to get through to the Galway office.  There was no one there to answer the phone and it would not be manned until 12 October.  I was told to phone the Dublin office.  There was no answer there and the phone message box was full.The letter ended by stating the process was a frustrating waste of time.  Will the Minister of State comment?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I am pleased to offer good news in this regard by way of the revised programme of Government which clearly sets out increased funding in the region of €30 million for an additional 500 teaching posts.  However, we must remember that the revised programme was agreed less than two weeks ago.  Nobody could expect the precise details regarding the division of teachers as between primary and secondary level and so on to be already agreed.The Deputy's criticism of NEPS is not reflective of the feedback we are receiving throughout the State.  If the Deputy has concerns regarding a particular case, I will be more than glad to discuss it with him.  However, it is not representative of what I am hearing in general.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	85	To clarify, my understanding is that there is to be an equal division of the 500 additional posts between the primary and post-primary sectors.  In other words, if 150 posts are created each year for the next three years, 75 will be at primary level and 75 at secondary level.  Is the Minister of State saying there has been no such agreement as yet?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Absolutely.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	87	On a recent television programme, the chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science, Deputy Gogarty, claimed that in the course of the final day of his party's exhaustive negotiations with the Minister of State's party, the latter was offering 300 additional teaching posts at 1 p.m. before increasing that offer at 5 p.m., when the pressure was on, to 500 posts.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I was not one of the senior Ministers who took part in those negotiations.  All I can say is that all successful negotiations take considerable time to conclude.  It will take senior departmental officials some time to analyse the situation in schools throughout the State in order to meet the requirements regarding pupil-teacher ratios.  However, Deputy Hayes can rest assured that the figure remains at 500.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 117 and 154 together.My Department's total budget in 2009 for primary, post-primary and third level capital is €841 million.  Of this, just under €614 million is in respect of primary and post-primary schools and just under €200 million is in respect of the third level sector.  In respect of third level sector capital, at the end of September a total of almost €115 million had been expended from a total allocation of just under €200 million.  I am confident the entire remaining sum of €67 million will be fully expended between now and the end of the year.  On the schools' capital side, expenditure to the end of September was €321.3 million, almost €92 million below the anticipated figure.The main area in which expenditure is less than anticipated is that of primary and post-primary major capital projects.  These projects comprise new schools and major extension and refurbishment projects.  The main reason that expenditure is less than originally anticipated on the major schools' capital projects is that my announced programme of 78 projects to commence construction in 2009 has been slower to get started on site than initially expected.  Another significant factor is that tenders obtained for this programme are yielding a reduction of  up to 30% as compared with prices at the height of the construction boom.  I have always put a high priority on the achievement of value for money in capital projects and I welcome this reduction in tender prices.It should be noted that any saving in 2009 relating to the later than expected commencement on site of any major project is a deferred or delayed commitment.  This commitment will now arise in 2010.  The rolling multi-annual capital envelope framework allows for the carry-forward into the following year of up to 10% of the annual capital budget and my Department will engage with the Department of Finance in this regard.These projects are the first batch of school projects to be tendered under the new form of public works contract now in operation throughout the public sector.  The introduction of this new type of contract and associated documentation for public construction projects, the use of which became mandatory in February 2008, has proved to be a significant culture change in the external construction consultancy industry.  A bedding down period has ensued while the external construction consultancy industry builds up expertise and familiarity with the new requirements.  It has taken an average of three months longer than originally expected to ensure the updated tender documentation is fully compliant with the new contractual requirements.The large number of relatively small projects involved in the schools capital programme has meant these delays have had a significant cumulative effect on anticipated capital expenditure.  There is a significant amount of capital expenditure planned for the remainder of the year.  I will continue to monitor the overall position carefully and will consider, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, the options regarding any capital savings.  These options include the option to carry forward to 2010 deferred expenditure commitments.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Will the Minister confirm that, between primary and post-primary, there are some 1,200 existing applications under the schools building programme, some of which have been lodged for a considerable period?  Will he also confirm whether it was his suggestion or that of one of his officials that some of the capital allocation which may not be expended this year may instead be used for information and communications technology roll-out such as, for example, the purchase of laptops for schools?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Before responding to Deputy Hayes, I apologise to Deputy Quinn for providing him with an incorrect figure.  To clarify, there are 151, not 159, additional classrooms.I understand the number of existing applications to the schools building programme is in the region of 1,200.  I will get the precise figure for Deputy Hayes in due course.  Regarding the diversion of funding, it should be noted that information and communications technology provision is part of the capital programme.  An allocation of €10 million was set aside for ICT this year and it is my intention to spend that money before the end of the year.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Is the Minister aware that 97 schools in my constituency are either renting or have purchased prefabricated accommodation?  Of those, four are paying out more than €500,000 per annum in rent.  This is wasted money.  The Department must take action without delay to progress the schools building programme.  Would it be helpful in this regard if there were more Ministers of State?  Is that the difficulty?  There are currently three attached to the Department.

Apart from the education benefit, the economy in general badly needs a stimulus of some type.  The Minister will do a great service to the country by ensuring this money is spent.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The current capital programme is the second largest ever to be rolled out in the State.  The money that has been set aside will be spent on capital projects throughout the country.  As I outlined in my reply, a new form of public works contract is now in place which places an onus on the builder to assume a greater degree of the risk associated with particular projects.  As they familiarise themselves with this new system, it has been taking consultancy firms an additional three months to put together their plans.  A workshop was held in Tullamore at which contractors were told precisely what is required under the new formal contract.  There have been teething problems but all the money set aside for major capital projects will be spent on those projects.  There will be a carryover of some of that money into 2010 but all the projects announced in 2009 will be covered by the Estimate given to me at the beginning of the year.

All the emotional energy expended in seeking to find out that information, which soaks up so much time in Tullamore, in the Department and at Question Time, could be done away with.  If the CAO system were run the way the Minister runs the schools building programme, there would be absolute chaos.  No young student would know where he or she was with regard to points and student applications to universities.  Has the Minister any moral sense of the duplicity of this system in its current format?

That school has released a CD about the issue.  I cannot build a school when its board has not acquired a site.  Negotiations are ongoing with the GAA.  I understand that a close affinity exists between the school and the GAA.  If we can get agreement from the GAA, then I want to buy the site.  Until such time as there is an agreement, the site is not legally in our ownership and I cannot build on a site that I do not own.  It is a simple as that.All of the money that I have been given this year will be spent on the projects that were outlined at the beginning of the year.  I expanded the summer works scheme.  I put in place an energy efficiency scheme, while a minor works scheme costing €30 million will be in place before the end of the year.  All the money available to me will be spent wisely and well, but some of it may move into 2010.

What is the justification for that?  Areas like Athlone have seen less than 6% growth, yet communities in my constituency that have seen 30% growth are being excluded.  Children are in buildings that are nearly 200 years old, while prefabs have been used for generations, yet nothing seems to happen.  There are huge waiting lists, yet they are not being prioritised within the Department.

I expect that my capital programme will be very extensive, but I cannot say exactly how extensive because we have not completed the Estimates.

There are 42 locations identified, and I will publish those when we have completed our programme.  Developing areas got about one third of the total provision in previous years, and as a representative, I would be very conscious that it cannot be concentrated in the one area.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I was struck by the Taoiseach's remarks earlier today in the Chamber about the difficulties that the country now faces.  There is clearly a range of serious problems ahead of us, and areas need to be changed and reformed.  I was in the Netherlands at the weekend with Deputy Reilly, and we walked from the train station to the hotel, minus limousines and so on.  I took the opportunity to visit a substantial hospital in the city centre, as well as some primary care centres, and I met with officials dealing with the Dutch health system.  What I saw was the health system that we should have for the future.  Patients are seen inside ten minutes, ambulances are required by law to pick up patients inside 15 minutes, yet the per capita spend for 17 million is €3,500, as opposed to €5,000 here.The Fine Gael Party has published its views on how the Irish health system can be transformed from being a two tier system to a universal single system that would operate effectively in the interests of every person who requires health treatment in this country.  What is in operation for 17 million people could certainly work effectively for 4 million people here.  We have had rows in this House about failures and inadequacies in the health system, and about the fact that it appears to be a bottomless pit.  In spite of pouring in money at an enormous rate——

I will support the Taoiseach and sit down with his people to work on a strategy to change the way we deliver health systems in Ireland at much lower cost and to far greater effect.  Will he consider that?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The HSE has been doing much good work to make sure that money follows the patient and that resource allocation is appropriate for the needs of patients.  The issue referred to by the Deputy relates to a position he outlined in recent times.  We have invited him to get his plan objectively costed by the Department of Finance, but so far he has declined to do so.Two key changes would probably be involved in the Deputy's proposal.  There are differences between the organisation of the private medical insurance systems in Ireland and the Netherlands.  I understand that there are approximately 17 private health insurance companies in the Netherlands, with no company having more than a 25% share of the market.  There are three or four such companies in this country, with the VHI having almost 70% of the market.  One of the problems with the proposal is that it might lead to private insurance companies making decisions on all hospital and GP services.  They might decide which hospitals carry out which services.There are 14 health insurance companies, as well as related subsidiaries, in the Netherlands.  That is not the case here.  It has also been proposed that health insurance should be compulsory.  Some people who do not currently buy health insurance would be required to do so.  It is obvious that not everyone gets health insurance for free.  It has not been made clear who will have to pay more, and how much more they will have to pay.  The proposal involves new public spending.  We do not agree with the claim that the State can subsidise the entire cost of new private health insurance policies for approximately 1.3 million people with medical cards, as well as heavily subsidising the cost of including 660,000 more people in the scheme, at no cost to the Exchequer because it is not feasible.  Perhaps the best means of starting a debate on future health reforms would be to get the Department of Finance to cost them in the first instance.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I am here to try to offer the Taoiseach and his Government help as they try to deal with a matter that causes a major crisis in the country on a regular basis.  When I was in the MCH hospital in The Hague yesterday, I learned that every patient who goes into the hospital is registered on the hospital's computer system.  When the number of patients in the hospital goes beyond the point at which patients cannot be seen inside ten minutes, an extra triage nurse comes on duty.  It is an outstanding system, as it operates in the interests of every person.  The longest period of time that passes between a person going into hospital and being sent home or being admitted is two or three hours.  There is no need for hand washers in every corridor of the hospital, as there is no MRSA problem.  Patients are admitted to separate units until it is determined whether they are positive for MRSA.This is the health system we need and can have in the future.  Our system should be based on the efficiencies in Holland, where there are five major health insurance companies.  The Government should follow through on it because it is so effective in looking after people's health interests.  I was intrigued by the Taoiseach's comment about the cost of this proposal.  I was under the impression that when political parties ask the Department of Finance to cost a proposal on a political basis, it is confidential.  I am not sure whether that is the case.  I would like to compare what I saw yesterday with the strategy of co-location, which has been defended by the Minister for Health and Children on umpteen occasions.  That strategy has not delivered a single additional bed.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Some 9,000 operations on adults were cancelled by the HSE between January and June of this year.  A further 1,000 operations on children were cancelled at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  Earlier in the year, we were told that would not happen.  Some 216,000 bed days were lost last year as a result of delayed discharges, which is the equivalent of Tallaght Hospital being closed down for a full year.  That is what we have got.  We know about the cancellation of the cervical cancer programme.  When I checked the latest figures before I came to the Chamber, I learned that 315 people are on trolleys in hospitals around the country today.  There are no trolleys in wards in any of the Dutch hospitals.I reiterate that I will support the Taoiseach in the right circumstances.  I am often accused of being at loggerheads with him on everything.  That is the case on most occasions.  The Taoiseach wants the health system to be sorted out.  It is recognised and understood that many things have gone wrong over the last 12 months under the system the Government has put into practice, which is endorsed by the Minister for Health and Children.  The chief executive of the HSE has been awarded a bonus of €75,000 on foot of such incompetence.  I accept that is not what the Taoiseach stands for.  It is not the kind of health system he wants.  As the Leader of the Opposition, I assure the Taoiseach that my party will support him if he is prepared to take on board the effective measures that can and do work in a country of 17 million people that is a two-hour flight from here.  If we start now, we can have such a system here.  Otherwise, a bottomless pit of taxpayers' money will continue to be pumped into an inefficient system.  The Taoiseach and I know how that can change.  If he is prepared to start real reform, so am I.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I do not agree with the continual portrayal of the health service, for all its problems, as not providing any successes or improvements.  That is clearly not the case.  If one examines successive HSE yearly service plans, one will see that many of the targets set in the plans have been met and in some cases exceeded.  Measures taken in areas like cancer care and the reorganisation of hospital services have been the subject of a great deal of local political controversy.  Deputies on all sides of the House have to withstand the pressures and concerns that arise from such developments.It is only fair for me to indicate to Deputy Kenny that if he makes any proposal to change the health system, as it is currently funded, he needs to have it costed.  If we have a costing on it, we can discuss it.  In the meantime, the Minister and her Government colleagues are interested in providing for the necessary flexibility and redeployment to facilitate best practice arrangements for better delivery of services.  Triage nurses have been provided in parts of our health system.  The need to try to provide for best practice across the system has been the big bugbear.  We have to get people to identify what is done well.  If the community care programme in the north west is working, that needs to be done with greater application throughout the country.  We should aim to replicate the success of the accident and emergency services in hospitals in Kilkenny, Waterford and elsewhere.  It is usually down to people's ability to organise themselves and work in teams.  Staff have to be prepared to make certain adjustments so that the service provided to clients and patients is better than is presently the case.  That is how we are seeking to go forward.  In the case of cancer care services, for example, we have had to rationalise from a position where we had surgical units in 42 of our hospitals, none of which had the throughput necessary to meet the relevant requirements and standards on a consistent basis or to avoid many of the unfortunate incidents that have been well discussed in this House and elsewhere over recent years.An acceptance of the need to embrace change in the health service, for the precise purposes mentioned by Deputy Kenny, should be more evident in this House.  I am open to listening to a constructive debate in this House on possible improvements in our health service, on the basis that we set out the costs of the alternatives and the issues that are at stake.  It is open to the Deputy to seek such a debate.  I understand that the Department of Finance has not been asked to undertake a costing of the Fine Gael proposal, but if it is asked it will do it.  It will be provided confidentially to that party in the first instance.If we are to come into this House and have a constructive debate on the matter, we should set out what the costs of the various proposals might be.  The possibility that it can all be done at no extra cost is not immediately obvious to us.  If it is all made compulsory, the State may have to fund the premiums of everyone in the country, including people who do not have universal health insurance at present.  Certain costs would be associated with that.  Important issues, such as the relationship between health service providers and hospitals and the manner in which we organise our services, have to be discussed and debated.  With respect to the Deputy, who seems to have had a very good trip to The Hague yesterday, we need more substance than a simple policy of replicating the Dutch system in Ireland.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	117	In the past year or so, we have spent a great deal of time discussing the banks.  Time and again, the Government has come into the House to ask us to stump up taxpayers' money to help out the banks.  The State guarantee scheme, which was introduced in September 2008, was followed shortly afterwards by the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the €7 billion recapitalisation of some other banks.  The NAMA legislation proposes to put up €54 billion in Government bonds to take the bad loans from the banks.  In return for that, we were told time and again there would be big changes at the top of the banks.  The guarantee scheme, for example, provided that the Minister or regulatory authority could give directions taking specified steps to restructure executive management responsibility, strengthen management capacity and improve the corporate governance of banks.  Unfortunately, we have not seen much change of this kind at the top level of the banks.  Bank of Ireland appointed a new chief executive but it was an internal appointment.  The chief executive of AIB announced his retirement on 30 April and has not yet been replaced.  Newspaper reports suggest AIB wants to make an internal appointment whereas the Government wants to make an external one.  One commentator, Mr. John McManus, writing in The Irish Times this week on these circumstances, stated “the decision of AIB to face down the Government indicates that the amazing arrogance that has characterised AIB’s behaviour over the past 12 months – and no doubt contributed to the mess it has found itself in – remains undiminished”.What exactly has changed, if anything, at the top level of our major banks in return for the taxpayers' largesse?  Is there a stand-off between the board of AIB and the Government with regard to the appointment of a new chief executive?  If so, will the Government hold its line on it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	118	It is important to point out the NAMA legislation and the changes in banking generally are to effect orderly restructuring of the banking and financial system over time.  Instead of speaking continually about stumping up money for the banking system, one should note an investment is being made by the taxpayer in a shareholding in two of our main banks and by way of having to nationalise another.  We get paid for the cost of giving the guarantee and also in respect of the preference shareholding we have taken in the two main banks.  That is important to point out.With regard to the question on specific changes in specific banks, there have been changes in a number of banks.  Discussions between the chairman of the board of AIB and the Minister for Finance in respect of seeking a prospective successor to Mr. Eugene Sheehy, who announced his intention to retire, are ongoing.  We seek to achieve what is best for the banking system generally.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The Taoiseach talked about changes being made at the top of the banks.  There is little or no evidence for them.  Let me outline the position regarding the main covered institutions since the guarantee was introduced.  All ten of the directors of AIB who were in place at the time the guarantee was made are still in place.  Eleven of the 13 directors of Bank of Ireland who were in place at that time are still in place.  With regard to EBS, eight out of 11 directors are still in place and, with regard to Irish Life and Permanent, six out of eight are still in place.  That is with the exception of the public interest directors.There is little or nothing changing at the top of the banking tree.  All that is happening is that the State or taxpayer is being asked time and again to put up funds to keep the banks going.  At the top of the banking tree, nothing significant is happening.The Taoiseach stated discussions are ongoing between AIB and the Minister for Finance on the appointment of a chief executive.  The State owns a 25% shareholding in that bank.  Will there be an internal appointment, as the board of the bank wants to insist upon?  Will there be an external appointment, as it would appear the Minister for Finance desires?Which is the dog and which is the tail in the case of banks?  The banks are very quick to come with their hands out seeking assistance.  We are to spend much of this week and most of next week dealing with the banks' requirements in terms of the writing down of bad debt but there seems to be no significant change at the top of the banking institutions.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I do not agree with the contention that there has been very little change.  There are different chairmen in various banks and different chief executives in various banks and building societies.  With regard to the institutions covered under the guarantee scheme, there have been a number of changes.  As the Deputy stated, there was an increase in the number of public interest directors appointed by the Government, and quite rightly so, in an effort to promote public confidence and ensure stability and continuity in a way that will in turn ensure the orderly reform of the banking system.  It is important that the matter be dealt with in an orderly fashion.I do not wish to discuss any individual banking institution but it is clear, on the basis of Mr. Sheehy indicating his preparedness to retire from his position, that there has been an ongoing effort, internally and externally, to determine who the best candidate for the post would be.In one particular bank, an internal candidate was decided upon on the basis that it was in the best interest of the bank given the candidates available or interested in taking up the position.  This is an ongoing issue.  As I stated, it has been dealt with regarding another bank.  I would like to see us proceed in this regard as best we can and as soon as we can.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	121	On behalf of the Fine Gael Party and my colleagues, I welcome to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery the husband and family of the late Nuala Fennell, former Deputy, Senator and Minister who served in this House with distinction from 1981until 1987, in Seanad Éireann from 1987 until 1989 and again in the Dáil from 1989 until 1992.I cannot really describe Nuala Fennell and her work any better than she described it herself.  It is a testament to her life and career that, despite her illness, she put pen to paper and completed her political memoir, Nuala Fennell: Political Woman — A Memoir, just a few weeks before she passed away.  Those who take the time at the back end of the year to read her political memoir will note it is a beautiful book about a beautiful person, as I described at the launch.  Nuala Fennell described herself in the book as having to contend with her own mother’s dilemma, which involved being one of the footsoldiers in a vast army of suburban housewives.  She was part of an irreversible movement that made the status of women a political issue for the first time in Ireland.  Reading her book invites one to consider the marriage ban that applied to women and the fact that women were owned as chattels and that one had to have a second signatory for cheques and books from libraries.  People could not visualise now the circumstances that obtained in the 1950s and 1960s.  Nuala described the loneliness of being part of what she deemed an almost exclusively male club during her first period in the Dáil.  She expressed this sense of loneliness when going about her work here as an elected Member.With regard to the AIM movement, encompassing action, information and motivation, Nuala Fennell made the point in her story that, in respect of family law legislation, including the Maintenance Orders Act 1974, not enough recognition was given to the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Patrick Cooney.  She made an outstanding contribution as a politician to increasing awareness of domestic violence and the necessity to provide shelter, through the women's aid movement, for battered wives and those at the receiving end of male domestic violence.  When she subsequently stood for election as an Independent in 1977, she received more than 3,800 votes and was elected in 1981 and re-elected in both elections of 1982.  Those of us who were here in that period remember the many stirring events and tension-filled occasions in the early 1980s.  Nuala Fennell was here for all of that.When she was appointed, in 1982, as Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs, she found there was no plan, no blueprint, no budget, no recognition and no office.  When she spoke to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice he suggested that it would be better for her to work from the Department of the Taoiseach, to which she was assigned.  She replied that she had lots of things to do which were relevant to the Department of Justice and that if she did not have an office, he might find her a broom cupboard from which she could do her business.  She later referred to her excitement, the following week, at finding a large office made available to her.  Her small budget allocation of £50,000 seems infinitesimal now.  Yet, that allocation, and her work as Minister of State, led to great things during her term and subsequently.  It is a measure of the society we then had that the late Archbishop Dermot Ryan, she tells us in her book, refused to have his photograph taken with her.  She was centrally responsible for the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy in Ireland and in establishing a mediation scheme for those who marriages had broken down.Hers is a story of the journey of Irish life from the 1950s until her passing.  She was supported in an outstanding way by her husband, Brian.  Having lived in Canada for a number of years and returned here as a journalist and later a politician, she was a woman who played her part.  She was a wife, citizen, politician, Minister, advocate and a really good person. The Irish Times described her as “courageous, determined and with an original mind”.  She made a real difference.I welcome her husband, Brian, her son Garrett and her daughters, Jacqueline and Amanda to the House.  As we do on such important occasions, I pay tribute and respect to her and salute the work of someone who went through the constituency of Dublin South on many occasions knocking on doors and who served, with Deputy Shatter and the late Deputy John Kelly, the good people of that constituency for many years.  It is only when people leave that we begin to examine the work they do.  I met Nuala Fennell on many occasions in the corridors of this house but one does not understand the attributes and qualities of a person until one has to concentrate on what to say in tribute to them.  To her husband and family, I say we salute a really good person who did a first class job in representing politics and the problems of people and who made an outstanding change in legislation and to women's rights and their involvement in politics.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I am pleased to have this opportunity to pay tribute to Nuala Fennell, a woman of great energy and strong achievement.  On behalf of my party and the Government, I extend sincere condolences to Nuala's husband, Brian, her children, Jacqueline, Garrett and Amanda and her grandchildren, Ian, Eveline, Kate, James and Amelie.  I also extend sympathy to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the loss of a former distinguished colleague.Nuala Fennell was a person and politician of the highest calibre.  I first got to know her over a quarter century ago when I was first elected to this House in a by-election in 1984.  Nuala was then a prominent member of Garrett FitzGerald's Government and was serving as Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs and family law reform.  While she and I were not on the same side in party politics, it would have been impossible not to respect and admire her commitment and the sincerity which she brought to her official duties.Compassion and commitment were at the core of her politics.  She was a woman of great energy and her whole purpose in public life was to advance the cause of equality in Irish society.  She was a moderniser and someone who believed passionately in advancing the role of women in Irish life.  Her achievements in this regard are significant and she leaves behind a hugely distinguished legacy of improving and promoting equality of opportunity for women in this country.Nuala passed away in August, when the House was in recess.  Of all the tributes paid to her in the media at that time, I will quote from one which underlines the changes she helped bring about.  This obituary, written by a colleague and friend, states:The overwhelming majority of the girls who get their leaving cert results today do not know the name, Nuala Fennell, but they will study, work and live in an Ireland that is much better for women because of her.  Nuala grew up in an Ireland where you could be paid half what a man would be paid for the same job.  If you were in the Civil Service you lost your job as a matter of course when you got married. You had to get your husband to sign a form in order to get a library card.  He could completely disinherit you in his will.  Equality between men and women simply did not exist and, in some areas, did not seem possible.  Her death last night was not headline news but, in one sense, it should have been because in the 70s, when a lot of pointless guff about dismantling the patriarchy by the sisterhood was going on, Nuala Fennell devoted herself to women's interests in a doggedly polite, practical way and in the process helped to improve Ireland for women for generations to come.Nuala Fennell's life's work was to ensure Irish women could come to play increasingly diverse and wide-ranging roles in the home, in jobs and in communities all over the country.  She was a believer in equality among the sexes and rightly saw the progress of women in our society as one of the benchmarks of the sort of country Ireland was and could become.  As a campaigning journalist, Nuala wrote extensively and persuasively on the need for enhanced equality between men and women in Ireland.  This was based on a sense of social justice and a deep practical patriotism which intuitively understood that for Ireland to fully prosper we had to make full use of our greatest resource, all our people.  For Nuala, a society that did not harness the full potential of all its people, men and women, was a society that was not utilising all its talents, energies, creativities, values or diversities of opinion.Nuala was a powerful advocate and called for change with the pen.  She wrote pioneering articles in the late 1960s and 1970s on women's rights in the  Evening Herald, Evening Press and Irish Independent.  It should be noted that she was also a front line activist who rolled up her sleeves and set about creating change, even before she entered the field of representative politics.  In 1972, she was a founder member of the AIM group, which was established to look after the interests of deserted wives.  She had an abiding commitment to helping the victims of domestic violence and she established the first refuge for battered women in Dublin.  In 1975, she become the first chair of Irish Women’s Aid and an executive member of the Irish Council for the Status of Women.Nuala was a strong believer in the need for more women in politics and once again, she practised what she preached.  She first stood for public office in 1977, when she contested the general election as an Independent in Dublin South.  She subsequently joined Fine Gael and contested the first direct election to the European Parliament in 1979.  In 1981, she was first elected a TD for Dublin South and held her seat in the two elections that took place in the following 18 months.  In 1987, she lost her Dáil seat in an extremely competitive constituency but was returned to the Seanad.  In 1989, she was triumphantly re-elected to Dáil Éireann and served in this Chamber for three more years with distinction before leaving politics in 1992 to run a successful public relations company.Those are the facts of Nuala's tenure in the Oireachtas but behind those statistics there is a trail of inspiration which helped drive many more women into politics and public service.  It is fair to say Nuala's achievements in electoral politics were a great source of encouragement to many other prospective female candidates across the political divide.  Nuala Fennell did not come from a family steeped in electoral politics but, in a constituency which contained accomplished politicians such as the late Séamus Brennan and the late John Kelly, as well as proven vote getters such as Deputy Alan Shatter and Deputy Tom Kitt, both of whom still grace this House, Nuala held her own.  She represented her constituents and her party with distinction.  Hers is a lasting and positive impact.She served for one term as Minister of State and although that tenure was relatively short she used her time to good effect and put in place significant foundations for a more progressive and fairer Ireland.  In 1985 she oversaw the publication of the Irish Women: Agenda for Action report.  That report contained strong recommendations to improve the status of women in health, social welfare, family law and employment.  She also introduced significant legislation dealing with domicile and citizenship rights.I especially want to mention today her great work in removing the stigma of illegitimacy from the Statute Book.  Before Nuala came to office outdated and offensive legislative provisions in this regard dating from the Victorian era and beyond remained enshrined in Irish law.  Nuala Fennell was responsible for abolishing those.  Such provisions were a blight on the face of a modern republic, and especially so in a State which had its origins rooted in the objective of cherishing all its children equally.  It is appropriate to say that Nuala Fennell, in a social and political climate that is very different from today, showed real political courage and foresight in ensuring children born outside marriage should have the same succession rights as children born within wedlock.Nuala Fennell will be remembered in this House with respect and warmth by colleagues on all sides who knew her as a politician who worked hard, who was tolerant of others and was deeply committed to the betterment of our country.  I extend my sympathies and those of my party, to her husband of more than 50 years, Brian, and to the rest of her family, friends and former colleagues.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dilís.

I join the Taoiseach in sympathising with Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the loss of a former Member of this House.We are paying tribute to a former Deputy, Senator and Minister of State who had an outstanding reforming record.  Both Deputy Kenny and the Taoiseach referred in particular to the work she did in abolishing the status of illegitimacy.  We are also paying tribute to somebody who has made an enormous difference to the life of this country.  One of the things I find interesting when talking with groups of young people in particular is how difficult it is to describe what this country was like 40 years ago and the enormous changes that have taken place in terms of its social legislation.Those changes came about because of the courage of the people who campaigned for that social change, who championed what was sometimes disparagingly referred to as the liberal agenda, over a period of time opening up this country and changing its laws.  Nuala Fennell was a champion of that change, because not only was this a very different country 40 years ago, a country where a woman had to give up her job when she got married, where women were not entitled to the same pay for doing the same job as a man, where contraception was illegal, where the reformation of a family was unthinkable, but where the laws were simply not in place and where there was a culture of oppression.Not only was that the legal position, but there was also a climate that made it very difficult to seek change.  It took courage 40 years ago to take on the powerful forces that were opposed to social change in this country, to take on church, State, and some very conservative opinion and thinking.  Nuala Fennell was a leader who took on those forces and brought about the kind of social changes and personal and social freedoms that we now enjoy, and that to some extent, we take for granted.  Nuala Fennell is owed a great debt for the role she played in that.She has been described by both Deputy Kenny and the Taoiseach as somebody who went about that work in a very pragmatic way, who saw the advantage of making incremental changes, of making the immediate reforms, of winning the battle step by step.  As the saying goes, there is more to be done, because many of the things Nuala Fennell fought for are still not fully achieved.  We still have an enormous problem in this country in the area of domestic violence.  We might have equal pay legally but the average earnings of women are still far behind the average earnings of men and we have still a very long way to go in terms of getting equality in political representation.  As we pay tribute to Nuala Fennell it would be well that we collectively rededicate ourselves to achieving the remaining objectives of the battle of which Nuala Fennell was a part, and the things she sought to achieve, some of which have yet to be fully realised.

I did not know Nuala Fennell very well but I had the privilege of meeting her on many occasions, and I have for a very long time known and revered her work in public life and in politics.  I admired Nuala Fennell's trail-blazing spirit back in the 1970s when she was among a cast of formidable women who made their mark in Irish public life.  I revered her practical work to help women, especially those who were victims of family violence at a time when it was a taboo subject which many people pretended was not happening.I admired her successful entry into politics as a woman candidate who was not part of a family dynasty.  I note from her memoir, sadly published earlier this month and just weeks after her death, that in 1981 she found Leinster House to be "a strange male club which felt like a political locker room".  But she was undaunted.  As Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs she had few resources and little back up but her practical side won out as she worked to abolish the concept of illegitimacy, to establish a mediation scheme for marriage conflict and to introduce legislation on citizenship and domicile.Again, I could identify with her enterprising spirit after she left elected politics in 1992, as she collaborated in the successful firm, Political Lobbying.  In sum, it was the brave and spirited women such as Nuala Fennell who ensured women ceased to be invisible in political life.  She and the women activists with whom she collaborated did not always agree, but Nuala Fennell and her colleagues did make an enormous difference.  That is why I am so very proud this afternoon to pay tribute to Nuala and her family on behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I join other speakers in expressing my sympathy to Brian and his family on the death of a very good colleague.  I was very privileged to have shared the constituency of Dublin South with Nuala Fennell.  Much has been said, rightly, about the tremendous contribution she has made to Irish politics, especially social legislation.  As Deputy Gilmore said, it was not an easy time for people to be engaged in campaigning on many sensitive social issues but Nuala was always very brave, courageous and professional in anything she ever did.I would also describe Nuala as a lady.  She was a very caring person and always had an interest in people.  When I was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for European affairs, arts and culture and women's affairs, I was privileged to succeed Nuala Fennell who was very supportive of me at that time.  It was unusual for a man to have such a position, but I was pleased to advance much of the work she had pioneered, in particular with regard to the equality proofing of legislation.  She made a huge impact in anything she did.  As a colleague, Nuala initiated ground-breaking work on equality and everything that has been said here is correct.On a personal level, I met her a few times after she left politics and she often referred to the fact that life after politics could be very enjoyable.  She did not have as many years with her husband, Brian, family and friends as we would have liked but she enjoyed every moment of her life with them.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I, too, would like to pay tribute to my former friend and colleague, Nuala Fennell.  Although I did not share time with her in the Dáil as she had retired before I was elected here, when I joined the Fine Gael Party in Dublin South she was very much a prominent national Deputy for that constituency and very much a role model for me entering politics, as she was for many women at that time.  My main memory of Nuala from those days was of her personal kindness to me as somebody new coming into politics.  She offered advice on all manner of issues both personal and political.  Some of the advice I still treasure and observe such as the best type of high heels to wear when canvassing.  It has come in very useful.As I got to know Nuala better over the years, I realised there were no sides to her, what one saw was what one got.  Deputy Kenny described her as courageous, and she certainly was that, but she was also a warm, open, kind person who embraced her friends and her colleagues and anybody who had a problem.  Their problems, issues and concerns became hers because that was the kind of person she was.  She cared about people and campaigned on their behalf.  Those two qualities are the hallmark of a really good politician, although I believe Nuala never saw herself as a politician or considered herself to be political.  She was a trailblazer on behalf of people, particularly on behalf of women, and God knows women needed somebody to blaze a trail for them in those days.When I speak of that time to my daughter, which is not so very long ago, she can scarcely believe the regime that existed then for women in the home, the workplace and in society generally.  The freedoms and opportunities that are now available to my daughter and to her generation are in no short measure due to the ground-breaking work and campaigning of a small group of women, for whom Nuala at that time was their political icon.  One of the sadnesses for Nuala was that those freedoms and opportunities that now exist for women in society generally did not increase the gender equality in this House.  She thought, I believe, to the very end that there were far too many suits in here.  I am afraid I have to agree with her, as I am sure will many of my women colleagues.Nevertheless, Nuala smoothed my path into this House.  I can tell her family, which may be of some consolidation to them now, of the huge fondness that still remains for her in Dublin South.  Whenever I canvass door to door or talk to people, it is great and encouraging to witness the number of people, primarily women, who mention Nuala, who remember some personal kindness or contact they had with her, but mostly they just want to bear witness to the work that she did for women and to record their appreciation of her legacy to all of our daughters.Nuala had many friends and at her funeral we saw the thousands of people from all walks of life who came and who will mourn her and miss her, but nobody will do so more than her family.  In every undertaking, at every meeting and in all her endeavours, both personal and political, as long as I knew her, Nuala was blessed to have her beloved Brian at her side, and she was not afraid to acknowledge that publicly again and again that she knew she was blessed.  As a couple, the term "the other half" had real meaning.  In every sense they complemented one another.  He was her other half and she was his.  I know that her sudden death — it was sudden in the end — leaves him heart-broken.  I know too that their children, Garrett, Jackie and Amanda, of whom she was so proud, take great consolidation from the fact that Nuala's life was lived to the full right to the very end and that they were so much at the centre of that life, both public and private.  Nuala took great delight and pride quietly from the fact that her interest in public life was passed on to her children.  She will be missed and I wish to extend my sympathy to her family and extended family.  I know that Nuala will rest in peace.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Like previous speakers, I want to extend my condolences to Brian, Jacqueline, Garrett, Amanda and the rest of the family.Nuala Fennell and myself had a very long association.  Our lives crossed in unexpected and strange ways.  I first met Nuala when I was a young law student in the early 1970s.  I was involved in the Free Legal Advice Centres.  At that time Nuala was a journalist writing about the impact on women of marital breakdown, the fact that no refuge existed for battered wives, the inadequacies of our laws, which dated back to 1886 and did not provide protection even for wives living in the home with their husbands who were not being properly supported.  The experiences I had as the director of a Free Legal Advice Centre in Crumlin and, ultimately, as the chairman of the Free Legal Advice Centres fed into Nuala's journalism and her work on behalf of women, in particular in the area of family law reform.The year 1972 was pivotal because two major reports were published for the first time in decades on the need to reform our marital laws and to provide greater protection for women.  One was published by the Free Legal Advice Centres and the second was published by the AIM Group, of which Nuala was a founding member, whose objective essentially was to reform aspects of family law.  The work that Nuala did with the AIM Group and that we in the Free Legal Advice Centres co-ordinated with her ultimately produced two important items of legislation, both of which, by coincidence, were enacted through this House by Paddy Cooney.  The Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 was the first modern item of legislation to provide for the support of spouses who were not being properly supported.  Section 22 of that Act provided the first ever legislative protection for battered wives.  It was the first time our courts were able to make barring orders to protect wives who were the victims of violence.  Without the campaigning work in which Nuala had been involved, I have no doubt that legislation would not have been passed.The same year, the Family Home Protection Act, which is still very much part and parcel of family legislation, stopped the injustice of the possibility — where a home was held in the sole name of a husband and where there were marital difficulties — that a wife could come home one day to find a removal lorry outside the door and the home secretly sold in circumstances of which she was unaware.  It seems extraordinary now that a wife could be in that position.  Meetings publishing the predicament of wives by the AIM group and political pressure and lobbying by that group, and by Nuala Fennell in particular, and the Free Legal Advice Centres contributed to the creation and ultimate enactment of that legislation.  At the same time in 1970s as I was dealing with wives in a Free Legal Advice Centre who were the victims of violence with nowhere to go, Nuala was taking the pioneering step of establishing a women's refuge for battered wives in Harcourt Street, a place I visited on many occasions.  It was the opening of that refuge in Harcourt Street which laid the foundation ultimately for the Women's Aid organisation and the refuges we have today.In 1979 Nuala ran for the European Parliament elections and, by coincidence, I ran for the local elections.  In 1981 we found ourselves as both colleagues and competitors on the Fine Gael ticket in Dublin South.  We ran five Fine Gael candidates in a five-seat constituency in those days, something all the tacticians now would tell us we should never do.  We were predicting that Fine Gael would win three seats.  The only journalist in the country who believed that was possible was Nuala Fennell.  There was not a single political journalist who thought there was the remotest possibility that Fine Gael would win three seats in that constituency, but we did.  We retained them through the two difficult elections of 1982 and subsequent to November 1982 Nuala became Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs.  As other speakers have said, a particular monument to her work as Minister of State was the ultimate enactment of the Status of Children Act in 1987, which abolished the concept of illegitimacy which had remained far too long part of Irish law and which sought to put children in a position of equality in the context of the general statute law.  Nuala remained part and parcel of Fine Gael in Dublin South until her retirement in 1992 and, as everyone has said, played a distinguished and courageous role in this House.Deputy Gilmore is also correct in stating that some of the battles Nuala fought in those days still remain to be fought.  I can remember us being at a joint press conference in the early 1970s describing the inadequacies of the courts system and the need to establish a family court — a unified family court structure to deal sensitively and comprehensively with family problems — and to this day we still do not have that structure.  No doubt Nuala, if she was still with us today, would be writing yet again about these issues as they become current in the political world.Nuala made an outstanding contribution to this House, she made an outstanding contribution to the Fine Gael Party and she made a pioneering and outstanding contribution, not only in the women's movement but as a journalist.  She wrote in the 1970s about many issues that other journalists were not interested in writing about and she went to the trouble to research them and write accurately about them.  It was that work of hers that laid the foundation for many of the reforms that took place through the 1980s and led to a very different Ireland and women in this country being placed truly in a position of equality in areas where for far too long they had been treated not merely as unequal, but not even recognised as persons with needs to be addressed.  Nuala will forevermore have a place in the history of this country and in the history of the women's movement for her contribution to law reform.As Deputy Mitchell stated, she will be missed greatly by all of her family, but particularly by Brian.  There was hardly a meeting of a Fine Gael branch in Dublin South constituency that Brian missed during Nuala's years as a TD and Senator.  As we did the constituency trail, Brian was extraordinary to the extent to which he attended meetings and provided assistance; quite clearly they were a couple who were extraordinarily attached to each other.  I offer Brian, Jacqueline, Amanda and Garrett my sincerest condolences.  I wish the family well.  May Nuala rest in peace.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	129	As a representative for Dublin South, I want to mark the tremendous work that Nuala Fennell did, for that constituency but also for the country, particularly in what was called the women's movement.  No doubt there were women who were more strident or more noteworthy at the time, but when historians look back asking who was the most effective in terms of making changes, many will answer that it was Nuala Fennell who, through her work in the political system, turned into real legislative change the cause that was required, namely representation.  She did that selflessly and with great honour.  Her family should be duly proud of her work.  We should be proud that there were such representatives who were willing to go from campaigning to come into, and spend their time in, the political system, which is often difficult.  One often faces votes where one may feel slightly compromised.  One faces difficult compromise as we must work within a party political system.  Ultimately, however, it is a way of effecting real legislative change and that is what Nuala Fennell did as a representative of the Parliament and as a Minister of State.  It is a great honour.We are now looking back some ten or 20 years.  I agree there is further work to be done, but the work she did was groundbreaking and was of significant benefit for all of the people of this country.  As a constituency representative of Dublin South, along with its other representatives here, I am glad to mark that.
#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I, too, want to extend my sympathies to the family of Nuala Fennell.  Being a relative newcomer to politics I did not know Nuala for very long, but I did have one brief encounter with her in Dublin South, where I am now the new TD, where she told me at the time of my selection at the convention to run for the recent by-election that I was not to mind anybody who said that journalists never made it in politics.  She told me that she had made the transformation and I, too, would be well able to make it.  She also told me that hers was the last time Fine Gael in Dublin South had three seats and that she was delighted to see that a journalist had come along and Fine Gael would have three seats again.  I found her just as Deputy Mitchell described — warm, open and kind.  I can say for certain that is true because in my short interaction with her, those were some of the characteristics which shone through.From my previous life as an ordinary citizen, having observed when I was much younger some of the work of Nuala Fennell, I know that she was a campaigning person and was quite tough in the fights that she would pick.  It is to be commended that she was a fighter on behalf of others, that she was a leader, that she would identify the important issues and that she had a great sense of fairness and of compassion.It strikes me, as everybody stated here today, that nobody doubts at all that Nuala Fennell did a great deal for women's issues and for the women's movement in this country.  Indeed, great tribute has been paid to that work but as I see it, with the luxury of where we are now with many battles fought and many rights established, which should never have had to be fought for at all, to the extent that Nuala fought for women's issues, she fought for my issues too.  I have a daughter, I have sisters and I have a wife, and there are women in my life.  The idea that someone would fight for their rights is the same as someone fighting for my rights because they matter too.Nuala should not be put in the camp of those fighting for one side or another.  She fought for us all, and she made a significant contribution in that regard.  It is my great honour to be following in her footsteps in Dublin South.  From my brief interaction with her, I can say that the campaigning and fighting spirit she had and the sense of justice which she seemed to pursue regardless of the personal costs in terms of efforts, etc., is something I hope I can carry forward to some extent.  I express my sympathies to her family and pay tribute to Nuala.Members rose.

We had requested that Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill be taken in the House, by which we meant a meeting of the House in Committee Stage with normal business being conducted on the respective days.  As I understand it, the Government is now proposing that the House will not meet in normal session this Thursday and that the Chamber will be used for a meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service to consider Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill and, that instead of the House meeting as normal next week, as it has done for the past two years following the October bank holiday weekend, the select committee will again use the Chamber to consider Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill.  This is unacceptable for a number of reasons.  First, that is not what we sought in terms of Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill.  We sought to have the matter dealt with by the House.  Second, this means there will be no Order of Business this Thursday and that there will be no Order of Business, Leaders' Questions or Question Time on Wednesday or Thursday next week.  This is not acceptable to the Labour Party.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will say when the arrangements for Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill will be brought before the House given they are not included in the proposals being put before us today.  When will the proposals to deal with the NAMA Bill be put before the House?  Also, will he reconsider those arrangements, which make a mockery of the House?  It is a bit of sleight of hand to pretend that because the select committee has the hire of the hall next week the House will somehow be in full session.  It will not be.

The Government proposal is a compromise to the various suggestions floating around.  The Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service will meet tomorrow at 2 p.m. to discuss the timing and processing of Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill.  It is expected the committee will agree to meet at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday morning in the Dáil Chamber to begin debate on the amendments and that it will continue its debate on the amendments next week.  That is the proposal we are putting to the House.  We believe it is the best compromise in respect of all proposals put to the Whip.  It is in the interests of getting agreement that this proposal is being put to the House.  The select committee will allow other Members who wish to contribute in the House to do so.  It will also give the Bill the prominence and time people expect.

It is appropriate that we pay tribute and give credit to Sharon and her family for their consistent courage.  I also want to recognise the efforts made by the Government, through the Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassy staff in dealing with the delicate negotiations on this sensitive matter.On the meetings held recently between Northern Ireland parties, the First Minister, Deputy First Minister and British Prime Minister, is there any movement in respect of the establishment of the North-South Parliamentary Body?  Has the Taoiseach had any contact or involvement in that regard?  The Taoiseach will be aware this is part of the Good Friday Agreement.  Perhaps he might update us on the position in this regard.

I join with everyone in the House in welcoming that outcome.  I also thank all of those people who worked so hard, skilfully and patiently over such a long time to achieve it.  I recognise the people in the Sudanese Administration who were helpful and co-operated with our efforts in this regard.  Finally, I pay tribute to the family of Sharon Commins who at all times, despite great distress and difficulty, showed a wonderful understanding and comprehension of the sensitivity of the situation and the need to enable those who were charged to do so to continue in their discussions and interactions with the authorities in that part of the world in an effort to return Sharon to safety.  I was impressed by their fortitude and discretion during what was a very difficult time, despite the long time involved.On the other matter raised, the Speaker of the Assembly, Mr. Hay, and the Ceann Comhairle's predecessor took a keen interest in developing relationships between the Oireachtas and the Assembly and used their respective positions of leadership as a means of advancing the base upon which trust and confidence could be built.  We look forward to the establishment of the North-South parliamentary body in due course.  A great deal of work and effort in this regard has been done by the Speaker and outgoing Ceann Comhairle.  I am sure the current incumbent will continue this work.

He brought to public attention the fact that the vaccine is now being distributed and that it would be two weeks before everything is in place.  We need to ensure that adequate arrangements are put in place.  That is the up to date position.  It is a question of ensuring distribution takes place, that people are properly apprised of the situation and then it can be rolled out.  It is important that it be done properly so I can only convey what I heard from the HSE personnel.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I move:That a supplementary sum not exceeding €4,000,000 to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of December 2009 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the amount of €4 million.  This will bring the total Vote of the DPP's office to €45.1 million.  The costs of the Supplementary Estimate will be met from savings elsewhere within the Taoiseach's group of Votes.The need for the Supplementary Estimate arises from increased demand led pressures on the two programme subheads, subheads B and C, in the Vote for the office.  As regards legal fees, there has been a significant increase in the number of fees paid in 2009 arising from levels of case activity and this has led to increased costs overall, despite reductions in the fee levels.  There has also been an increase in the number and size of awards made by the courts.  In other regards, the director in 2009 is within budget on salary costs and other administrative costs.  He is also broadly within expected expenditure levels with regard to the local State solicitor service.In recent years we have assigned more gardaí and allocated increased resources to the courts, and inevitably this has led to increased activity in the prosecution service and associated legal costs for the DPP, despite applying the reduction of 8% in individual fees to barristers.  There have also been associated costs for the defence which is provided mainly through the criminal legal aid scheme administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.More criminal cases are being tried and disposed of in the courts.  In the Central Criminal Court, where murder and rape cases are heard, the number of judges sitting in 2009 was increased.  During 2009, seven Circuit Courts regularly sat in Dublin compared to six in 2008.  Additional sittings have also taken place on circuits outside of Dublin during the year to reduce significant backlogs in dealing with criminal cases which had developed in some parts of the country.  While most cases end in either guilty pleas or short trials, some high profile and complex cases can run for a considerable period and result in substantial costs.  Two such cases this year ran for a combined total of 116 days.In recent years the remit of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been extended.  Under legislation enacted in 2005, the 32 local State solicitors moved from the aegis of the Attorney General to report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In 2001, the Government oversaw the transfer of the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Notwithstanding this, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, in common with other public sector bodies, must now do more with fewer resources.I would like to outline the range of measures the DPP has implemented to reduce expenditure in his office.  I understand he has managed to reduce operating costs without adversely affecting frontline prosecution services.  He has been able to operate in 2009 with a non-pay administrative funding of €3.1 million or 38% less than in 2008.  The DPP has also delivered the 3% payroll savings target set for all Civil Service organisations.  He has also implemented initiatives within his office to reduce expenditure on counsels' fees, such as the non-application in September 2008 of a 2.5% increase in fees, suspension of the long-standing practice of paying an additional refresher fee for cases which run beyond 5 p.m., and the application of the 8% reduction in fees.  I understand equivalent measures have been taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of defence costs.The DPP has provided assurances that the fees paid to counsel who prosecute on his behalf are well below the rate which counsel would charge to a private client and that every effort is being made to minimise legal costs while maintaining the prosecution service.  The DPP has also pointed out that in the majority of indictable cases he is represented only by a single junior counsel.  I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is bringing forward changes aimed at ensuring that a senior counsel may be assigned to the defence only in more serious cases.  This initiative was also approved of by the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, as were a number of other cost saving proposals the Minister is bringing forward in a new criminal legal aid Bill which is currently being drafted.However, as I said previously, while the DPP is within budget with regard to salaries, operating costs and the costs of the local State solicitor service, funding pressures exist on his two programme subheads.  That is why I come before the Dáil today to propose a supplementary estimate of €4 million.  Subheads B and C of the Vote are experiencing significantly higher than anticipated levels of activity in 2009.Subhead B provides for the fees paid to counsel who prosecute cases on behalf of the DPP in the various criminal courts.  Notwithstanding the 8% reduction in counsels' fees, the DPP's office has seen a significant increase in the total cost of fees paid in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting activity levels in the courts.  In monetary terms, by the end of September some €11.629 million had been paid on fees.  It is estimated that a provision of an additional €3 million will be required to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet liabilities this year.  This addition of €3 million will bring the total provision for subhead B to €15.293 million.There has been a significant increase in the number of brief fees and refresher fees paid.  The brief fee is paid to counsel on the first day of trial or when a guilty plea is entered.  It is anticipated that the final number of such fees this year could be 32% higher than last year.  There also has been a substantial increase in the number of refresher fees paid compared to 2008.  This fee is paid on the second and subsequent days of trials.  It is estimated that the final number of these fees this year could be 29% higher than last year.I turn now to subhead C, which provides for the payment of legal costs awarded by the courts in judicial review matters and other applications connected to legal proceedings.  While the DPP's office takes steps to minimise both the number and value of awards, there is limited action which can be taken within the current legislative framework to contain costs.  A new legal costs Bill is being drafted in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which aims to bring more transparency and clarity to the current system of legal costs.  This is being progressed as a priority issue and I understand it is expected to be published next year.  It is estimated that a provision of an additional €1 million will be required to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet legal costs awarded by the courts which will arise in the remainder of the year.  This addition of €1 million will bring the total provision for subhead C to €7 million.In conclusion, the additional funding of €4 million I am seeking today, which I emphasise will be funded from savings this year from elsewhere within the Taoiseach's Vote group, is essential to ensure the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has sufficient funding to continue to discharge its functions the end of this year.  As I outlined, I am assured that every effort has been made by the DPP to keep expenditure as low as possible.  His efforts with regard to his administrative costs have produced real and substantial savings, involving tighter staffing numbers and pay costs, and non-pay administrative funding has been reduced in 2009 by €3.1 million, or 38%.  The DPP has also implemented initiatives within his office to reduce expenditure on fees, such as the non-application in September 2008 of a 2.5% increase in fees, suspension of the long-standing practice of paying an additional refresher fee for cases which run beyond 5 p.m., and the application of the 8% reduction in fees.  However, the need for this Supplementary Estimate has arisen from demand-led pressures on the DPP's Vote this year and the level of court activity and from court awards.  The cost of the Supplementary Estimate will be met from savings elsewhere on the Taoiseach's group of Votes.I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	176	It is almost a year since the Taoiseach reassured the House that slashing of funding to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions would have no adverse effects on the work of the office or on the role, function or carrying out of the duties of the DPP.  Last November, the Government robustly defended its decisions to cut the budget of the DPP.  Speaking in the Dáil, two months later, in January of this year, the Taoiseach, in reply to a question I raised, referred to the cut as a "minor imposition".  The Government defended its action, despite the DPP's assertion that his office would be unable to process its workload and that it was already "very lean".  The DPP stated at the time that the cuts the Government was inflicting on his office would make it "impossible to continue to provide an effective service".At a time when the DPP's case load has been steadily increasing — by from 5% to 6% per annum — his budget was €3.5 million less this year than last year.  Before the cut was made, EU reports, such as those of the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice, had found that Ireland's prosecution service had a pathetically low rate of per capita investment in its prosecution service compared to other EU states.  It is no wonder our conviction rate for serious crime is so low.A study of 11 European countries, published last April, recorded that in Ireland only 8% of reported rapes result in convictions.  This rate is one of the lowest in the study.  Reporting of rape had increased in Ireland by more than 500% between 1977 and 2007, but the conviction rate had fallen.  Between 1998 and 2000, the conviction rate was 16%, but the study found this had dropped to 8%.  Commenting on Ireland's abysmal record in this area, TCD criminologist, Dr. Paul O'Mahony, said the problem here appears to be one of under prosecution.A parliamentary question raised on 16 September this year indicated that 114 murders involving firearms took place between 2004 and September 2009.  As of 10 September this year, eight convictions had been secured for these 114 murders.  That is a conviction rate of a mere 7%.  The conviction rate for murders generally in the period 2004 to 2009 was less than 30%, with just 91 convictions secured for a total of 313 murders.Where antisocial behaviour type offences are concerned, the Central Statistics Office has reported that, between 2003 and 2008, of the 13,460 offences carried out with knives, sticks or other offensive weapons, only 4,361 people were convicted.  In other words, fewer than one-third of offences for the possession of knives and other non-firearm weapons have resulted in convictions over the five years up to and including 2008.  Considering the very constrained budget with which the DPP is dealing, we must commend the achievements of Mr. Hamilton and those who work in his office.  This year, while his budget plummeted, the Government put on further pressure.The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, introduced surveillance and anti-gang legislation.  This year he proposes to introduce DNA database legislation.  He has promised that the net result of this will be more successful convictions, yet the office charged with achieving this surge in convictions is being starved of funds.  Now, towards the end of the year, we must grant a Supplementary Estimate to keep the show on the road.  Fianna Fáil's favourite approach, of legislating without providing resources, is evident once again in the area of justice.   Almost 12 months after the cut was made to the DPP's office, we note a shortfall of €4.3 million in its budget.  We are now voting merely to keep the show on the road for another few months.  This is a very strange approach to one of the most important offices in the State.Last year the DPP announced his workload would increase even more, by providing relatives and victims of crime with reasons for not prosecuting or nor proceeding with a prosecution, in cases where a crime has been committed resulting in death.  This new approach would help demystify the legal process, Mr. Hamilton said, and I agree.  A pilot project is being undertaken in this regard.  There is talk about the process being extended to other genres of criminal matters.  Perhaps the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, would brief the House on the progress of that pilot project and offer his views on it.  He might also, in this context, say why he chose to reject out of hand a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy Alan Shatter and me last year, which included provisions for the exact type of process in which Mr. Hamilton is now engaged.The briefing material accompanying the Supplementary Estimate indicates that the shortfall in the budget of the DPP has arisen on the programme side, namely, fees to counsel, and general law costs.  The Office of the DPP has already shaved €400,000 off barristers' fees by abolishing extra payments for court cases that run after 5 p.m.  As this Supplementary Estimate shows, however, the office still continues to struggle.  What solutions can the Minister offer the Director of Public Prosecutions and what leadership is being shown in this area?  Cutting a budget, and then when a decision is shown to be deeply flawed, introducing a Supplementary Estimate, is not the ideal of adept leadership.  Just as we cannot continue to create new offences without addressing the serious problems in our prison system, so too, we cannot introduce new anti-gangland measures while cutting the budget of the State prosecutor.The Government's approach to prosecutions is wholly inconsistent and unsustainable.  This type of flip-flopping is the result of poor decision making by the Minister in charge.  I have the greatest respect for the Director of Public Prosecutions and I believe he must be listened to when he estimates the budget his office needs to prosecute crime on behalf of the people of this State.  He is not prone to exaggeration and certainly not prone to waste.  It is a year since Mr. Hamilton warned his office could not function efficiently or effectively with a serious budget cut.  His warning has proven to be correct.  In the preparations for the forthcoming budget, I ask the Minister to engage with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and with the DPP.  The Minister should listen to the director when he outlines the funding needs of his office and respond positively towards him.There are many areas where savings can be made, but we cannot be miserly when it comes to criminal prosecution and justice for the victims of serious criminal acts.  I am happy to support the allocation of additional funding to the DPP, and I wish his office well in the important work that it undertakes on behalf of the people of this country.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	177	The presentation of this Supplementary Estimate summarises all that is most difficult and in default with regard to the Government's management of public finances.

Each Department seems to have produced a wish list, while the expenditure section of the Department of Finance also had one, and the two wish lists were edited together into the McCarthy report.When the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, was Minister for Finance he delivered with a great fanfare what he described as a reform of the budgetary process.  He did away with prior Estimates and instead, brought in a reformed process, where Estimates were introduced on the same day as the budget.  That has resulted in an enormous reduction in the amount of information provided about Government spending plans on a departmental level, not just to the detriment of the Opposition, but also I suspect, to the Government itself.  Formerly, the Estimates process had to be reviewed and completed a month or six weeks before the budget.  The purpose of the reform, on paper, was very valuable because it was meant to be supplemented by activities in committee, where the type of detailed discussion regarding the Vote, outlined by Deputy Charles Flanagan, would have taken place well in advance of the budget and the Estimates then being published on budget day, because the committee would have discussed the matter in hand.  Instead, the position now is that the information only becomes available when we are almost at the year end or on budget day.The Minister for Finance says the €4 million will be found by other reductions in the Taoiseach's Vote.  We do not even know what the other reductions are.  Are they as a result of waste, because in many ways the McCarthy report is a testament to waste, since it issues lists of so many areas where money was spent, as much to gain political patronage as to do with the politics of the State?  It goes without saying that the Vote of the DPP is fundamental to the rule and administration of law in this country.  That is particularly true in the case of people who have suffered injury or been bereaved as a result of murder, manslaughter or vicious assault.  If confidence is to be restored in the legal system among communities that find themselves under siege, there must be successful prosecution to bring murders and professional criminals speedily to justice.  We share a constituency, so the Minister knows that the toll of murders over a number of years there, and in the constituency of the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, has been frightening.  Many of those murders have gone unprosecuted and unpunished and the families made bereft of fathers and sons, for the most part, who have been murdered or killed, are waiting, in many cases, for justice to be done and to be seen to be done, with the wrongdoers deservedly being sent to prison for long periods of time.  Having a functional DPP office which prosecutes on a timely basis and gets convictions is crucial.One hardly ever wakes up these days without RTE reporting from some part of the country about somebody being murdered, killed or the subject of manslaughter.  There was another such case in my constituency within the past ten days where a young man seems to have been beaten to death while at a disco.  The impression and feeling of lawlessness that this Government has allowed is now strongly implanted in society.With regard to professional criminals, I do not know whether anything has been done which seriously provides for the recovery of moneys from those who have acquired substantial assets, to cover their defence costs.  Usually the cost of the defence of professional criminals is met through the legal aid system.  Will the Minister say whether the 8% reduction in fees has been fully carried through, in terms of the services provided by barristers, solicitors and others, for legal services supplied to the State?  It is important for public servants who are taking such a significant hit in terms of the pension levy as well as the other levies and taxes, that the sheltered private sector in Ireland, particularly where it gets much of its business from the State, is seen to be taking a commensurate hit.I frequently pass the new Taj Mahal of the Courts Service, the new court buildings at the bottom of Parkgate Street, near the Phoenix Park.  It is a huge complex.  It is gigantic.  There is a cost which was undertaken through a PPP mechanism when the Celtic tiger was at its height.  Have the fees to be paid for that court arrangement been subject to any renegotiation?  I am sure that court will be magnificent.  The Phoenix Park has a very large memorial to the Duke of Wellington which has dominated the Dublin skyline for centuries.  However, while it may not be as tall, the new courts complex is significantly bigger than the Wellington monument and now dominates the entrance to the park.Some €42 million has been paid to date on the proposed prison at Thornton Hall, including the latest few tens of thousand of euro to be spent on additional landscape work around the prison.  We are now living at a time when many families have lost employment.  Families are living in very reduced circumstances, but we are still living with the legacy of Charlie McCreevy and a party on attitude, when nothing was too good or costly for the group of Ministers across the benches.  Is the Minister aware of what the Taoiseach will cut from his Vote?  Will it be superfluous items that just went with the glory years or will it cut into services that may be required?The current DPP has done a considerable amount to improve the status and standing of the office.  The efforts made by the DPP to increase the level of communication from his office particularly in the distressing circumstances of the avalanche of murders that regularly occur has been extremely important to the families of the victims.  The various measures to improve information on court procedures given to the families of victims when they go to court are all welcome.  From speaking to families in my constituency who have had to go to court to sit and listen to a case regarding their loved one who was murdered, it is clear that the improvement in communication has been extremely important.  I commend the DPP and urge him to continue that process.

Society must make a choice about investing in the justice system.  It is welcome that we are ensuring the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions continues to operate properly until the end of the year.  However, it says much about the budgetary system and the absolute failures in the Minister's budget last year to take account of what is happening in the justice field.While I was not present when the Minister gave his opening address on this matter, I have since read it.  He has said that there have been savings by the DPP.  However, he had no choice because otherwise he would have been in the position of seeking additional moneys in May.  The Minister and his officials failed to take account of what was happening in the justice area if they miscalculated by €4 million the cost of running the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It has been plain for anyone to see that the courts are bogged down by more and more complex cases.  The more complex they get the costlier they will get and the more time consuming they will be.  Obviously it is important that justice is seen to be done and that every angle is covered.The DPP is in a very difficult position.  There is often a demand by the public for cases to get to court more quickly.  The dangers of that have been seen time and again in the past year and in previous years, in that court cases are collapsing.  When a court case collapses I presume legal counsel gets paid in full, even with the 8% reduction the Minister has quoted here.  It is a difficult game for the DPP to juggle money.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions should always have the required sums, but it should be backed up by the changes required in terms of ensuring that the justice Vote as a whole — even though this one comes under the Department of the Taoiseach — deals with savings.  If the money were invested in the probation and welfare service we could save millions if not tens of millions of euro every year by diverting people in larger numbers away from the prisons to community service and similar programmes through which offenders would be seen to pay their dues to society.Obviously there is also a need to save money by avoiding circumstances where barristers — or solicitors at the very least — judges, those who are charged and witnesses all turn up in court only for the case to be adjourned because the material is not ready or there is some other delay.  There needs to be greater co-ordination between the prosecution and defence to ensure a court case goes ahead on the scheduled date and that additional cost is not heaped upon the DPP owing to mistimed court cases.The cuts in the Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions last year and the cuts in Garda overtime, the blocking of promotions in the Garda Síochána and the recruitment ban all add up to major problems in the justice system in the foreseeable future.  In addition there is the difficulty that the forensic science laboratory has not gone ahead.  The only thing that has gone ahead — this says much about Irish society under the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Governments — is the privatisation of justice and public private partnerships.  I heard mention earlier of the glass box at the entrance to the Phoenix Park.  The development of the courts complex is to be welcomed and I welcomed it at the time when we debated it.  However, the problem is that it is under the PPP system just as the Government proposed for the prison complex at Thornton Hall.  That is the legacy.It is interesting that this comes about through a saving of €4 million from the Department of the Taoiseach's group of Votes.  I wonder where those savings were made.  I did not notice the Taoiseach mention that he had a spare €4 million floating around in his Vote that he could spend on anything.  Many schools that require special needs classes etc. would like to have heard that earlier so they could ask the Taoiseach to divert that money to those causes rather than to the DPP.  However, as the DPP needs this money, I am not arguing against it and will not vote against it.  It is an absolute failure with regard to the forecasting of figures if, for such a small Vote as that of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Minister got it so wrong.I presume that, prior to the budget last year, the DPP made submissions to the Minister that he would have a certain amount of costs for the period 2009-10 and that he had already pared back on costs and tried to save, as we know from previous years.  Yet, in his wisdom, the Minister last year introduced a cut.  We are now dealing with a major crisis because if the DPP's office did not get this €4 million, matters would slow to a halt until the new year or until the budget was saved.I do not believe there is any opposition to this Estimate.  It simply shows the need for much more time and effort to be put into forecasting the exact cost of the court cases the DPP is preparing.  We know in advance approximately how many court cases the DPP will present next year because cases are usually taken a year after the arrests, given the time it takes to get to court.  The prediction would be simple to make.  The Minister mentioned two cases which collapsed and then ran on for a combined total of 116 days, but, while they might have been slightly abnormal cases, they would not have been out of synch with previous years.  There are often substantial court cases, and future cases will be increasingly complicated as the Garda Síochána and the DPP rely increasingly on forensic evidence in trying to prove a trail of evidence while the criminal gangs try to beat the system and make it more difficult for convictions to be gained.I urge the Minister, when responding, to deal in particular with the preparation for this year's budget and to take account of the failure to ensure the DPP has sufficient moneys to deal with the workload he and his office will undertake for the period 2010-11.  We must ensure we do not have to come back to the House in October or November next with an emergency or Supplementary Estimate just to allow the DPP's office to survive.

In the immortal words of one famous Irish politician, "What crisis?"  The DPP is doing his job very well.  In fact, he has been very successful at implementing economies in his office.  I join all Members of the House in commending him on his work and the great ability he has brought to it.  He is not and should not be the subject of any party debate between us but, in regard to this alleged crisis, there is no crisis.  The simple explanation——

This can be illustrated by the fact that this increase has taken place notwithstanding an 8% reduction in fees.I confirm, in response to Deputy Burton's question, that the position is that this has been applied to all legal professionals.  That has also taken place despite the fact that the director took certain measures in regard to the payment of additional fees after certain hours.  All of that has been done by the director and the Government to contain costs.  The director has gone a long way in containing his own payroll costs and the costs of his office.This is a demand-led aspect.  Because of the independence of the DPP, his Vote must be separate from other Votes.  With me and my Department, the Taoiseach bears an overall responsibility in regard to the preparation of the Estimate but the DPP must have a separate Vote to confirm his independence.  That is why it is necessary to vary it at this stage of the year.  All I am saying to Deputy Ó Snodaigh is that this will be done by any responsible Government and Minister in the circumstances we are in.It raises questions about the commitment of the Opposition parties to the necessary fiscal controls we must have that they find it surprising we would have insisted on rigorous control of public expenditure at the outset.  Better to have erred in that direction than to provide too much at the start.  We are now dealing with the necessary contingency that arose, which was not a foreseeable contingency——

We will always work in close co-operation with the director.Deputies Burton and Ó Snodaigh asked where the money was found within the group of Votes allocated to the Taoiseach so that, although there has to be a Supplementary Estimate in law because of the independence of the director, we have sufficient funds to meet these accrued liabilities.  Within the Taoiseach's group, we have located savings at the Central Statistics Office and at the National Economic and Social Development Office.  There is also the position in regard to the Moriarty tribunal where certain third party fees are not yet agreed, so that liability has not yet arisen.  Therefore, we have been able to find the necessary funds within the Vote allocated to the Taoiseach to meet this requirement.That is really as far as I can move it.  I welcome the comments of the Opposition in regard to the director.  I agree with them in regard to the tremendous job he has done and is doing.  I commend the Estimate to the House and welcome the support of the Opposition parties for it.

Accordingly, he is not available for the remainder of this debate.This is a simple Bill and, in many respects, unnecessary.  However, Fine Gael supports the concept of it.  I realise the Minister in a pragmatic gesture of co-operation decided with his Green colleagues to bring forward this legislation.There are two main parts to the Bill, one dealing with the issue of the European Defence Agency, EDA.  It is important in the first instance to point out that the European Defence Agency assures us that European soldiers participating in peace support operations have modern, safe equipment.  In other words, Irish soldiers can participate in operations with soldiers from other countries, including neutral countries like Austria and Sweden, with modern equipment to ensure their safety.  Not having the best equipment puts soldiers' lives at risk.  Over the years since 1955, 85 soldiers have died in the service of peace.Participation in any EDA programme is on an entirely voluntary basis.  Ireland has participated in programmes in the past.  This legislation will bring the matter to the Dáil for approval before we participate in any further programmes with the EDA.Much was made of this issue during the debate on the Lisbon treaty, with the incorrect suggestion from some quarters that there would be a requirement on us to spend more money on military equipment.  The EDA is basically about pooling military resources and availing of economies of scales.  It is certainly to Ireland's advantage to participate in such an initiative.  I am confident that expenditure on military equipment will ultimately decrease across the European Union as a result of these economies of scale and the pooling of resources.  This type of co-operation will also ensure there is greater interoperability between the various forces involved.It is interesting to note that the United Nations fully supports the development of the European Union's capacity to respond to crises, as outlined in the Petersberg Tasks.  The former Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, in the course of an address to the National Forum on Europe stated:I want to leave you in no doubt of how important strengthened EU capabilities are to the UN.  The EU is in a position to provide specialised skills that our greatest troop contributions may not be able to give us and to deploy more rapidly than we can.The current Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, made a similar point when he said in Dublin last July:The United Nations has an ever expanding relationship with the European Union.  Indeed, the EU is one of our most important partners.  Let me assure you that Ireland's participation in EU military and civilian missions is fully compatible with its traditional support for the United Nations.  This is not a zero sum game in which more support for one institution means less for the other.  We are in this together.Involvement in the European Defence Agency will ensure a more efficient expenditure of resources as we benefit from economies of scale.  It will also allow our troops to operate with the best equipment and in a safer environment.The Bill also addresses the concept of permanent structured co-operation.  It was mooted during the campaigns on the Lisbon treaty that developments in this regard would oblige us to participate in certain actions against our will.  Realistically, however, it is far more likely that we should be obliged to seek assistance from other member states than vice versa.  We have not expended the necessary investment in military equipment and capability to allow us to cope unaided should we encounter any major threat.  Under permanent structured co-operation, smaller groups of member states may decide to participate for the purposes of training, logistics or capability deployment.  It will not oblige us to engage in missions on behalf of the Union which have not been approved by all member states.  In short, Ireland can choose to participate or not in future permanent structured co-operation arrangements.  The legislation before us today provides that any proposal to engage in any aspect of such co-operation must receive the approval of the Dáil.  While I stated at the outset that the Bill is not strictly necessary, it will be helpful to underline the openness and transparency that will attach to the process.  That will allay the fears that have been expressed in this regard by a sizeable section of the population.Our contribution to peace throughout the world has been significant and has been beneficial to our troops and to our international image.  It is very important that everything possible is done to ensure the safety of our troops abroad.  Irish troops operate in some very volatile situations, including those engaged in our current largest deployment in Chad.  We all welcome the release of Sharon Commins and her Ugandan colleague.  Such incidents bring home to us the dangers for Irish personnel, whether peacekeepers, aid workers or others, operating in regions of acute political sensitivity.  I ask the Minister for Defence, in conjunction with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to work with the various aid agencies to review the mechanisms they have or do not have in place for the security of their personnel.  It is vital that adequate security arrangements are in place for Irish people working with aid agencies in these sensitive areas.  We are all very thankful that the two hostages were released unharmed at a very difficult time, but others have not been so lucky in the past.  There must be a review of the security procedures operated by the aid agencies.  Not only are individuals at risk but there may be a knock-on effect, for example, for our troops in Chad.  I support the Bill.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I join colleagues in offering my sympathy to Deputy Deenihan on the death of this mother.  I also sympathise with the families of the two members of the Defence Forces, Captain Derek Furniss and Cadet David Jevens, who died so tragically in Connemara.  Colleagues referred to the 85 members of the Defence Forces who have died while engaged in peacekeeping duties overseas, but accidents such as that which occurred last week are equally a terrible tragedy for the families of those involved.This Bill provides the legislative mechanisms for Irish co-operation in missions associated with the European Defence Agency.  The Bill also provides that such missions will require Government and Dáil approval and must be associated with the increasing capacity for European Union peacekeeping missions.  A feature of both campaigns on the Lisbon treaty was the prominence of misinformation particularly in the area of security and defence policy in respect of which those opposed to the treaty succeeded in stoking unfounded fears.  The research undertaken by the Government in the wake of the first referendum showed that a perceived threat to our neutrality was an important concern for voters.  People were afraid their children would be conscripted into a European army even though the Lisbon treaty includes no provision for the creation of such an army.  These concerns were addressed in the second referendum by the legal guarantees on security and defence negotiated by the Taoiseach in Brussels.Ireland has a long-standing commitment to conflict prevention, peacekeeping and conflict resolution.  We salute our servicemen and women for the wonderful work they have done.  They have contributed enormously through their great competence and professionalism to Ireland's image abroad.  Since joining the United Nations in 1955, Ireland has led many overseas operations.  The first peacekeeping campaign in which we participated was in 1958 when some 50 officers were assigned to the United Nations observer group in Lebanon along the armistice demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel.  The first peacekeeping mission to which the armed Irish contingent was committed was in the Congo between 1960 and 1964.  Since then Irish troops have served in Cyprus from 1964 to 1973, in Lebanon and in various other areas.  Last January a delegation from the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs visited the 44 remaining Irish troops at Camp Shamrock in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Those troops work with thousands of personnel from other countries protecting a fragile democracy and helping to police the political and ethnic divide.  The Minister has been there on several occasions.  It was great to see at first hand their work with the local police and defence forces and the assistance they provide to the EUFOR mission.  Bosnia Herzegovina has a population of more than 4 million people.  There are major challenges in that country, and they have worked hard to protect the population in that very fragile area.The most high profile operation of the Defence Forces is currently in Chad.  That country has been rocked by tribal, ethnic and political violence in recent years and the Army has played an important role.  General Pat Nash was the operations manager for the EU force in Chad, which was the largest ever EU operation.  He recently handed over control to the UN force.  Irish people have played a very important role over the years in peacekeeping operations.  General Nash operated from the headquarters in Paris, where there was very good planning.  I read an interview given by General Nash, and he said that while Chad is now a safer place, it is still very poor with few medical facilities.The EU played a very important role in Chad, with 26 member states sending troops there.  It was a difficult task for the Irish troops when they started operations.  They set up Camp Ciara and 147 troops were sent in advance to do this.  They set up logistical operations in the area.  Chad is twice the size of France, with a population of around 11 million people.  Poverty is everywhere.  There is only 500 km of paved roads, as much of the terrain out there is desert.  It was difficult for Irish troops to move into this area, but they succeeded and did extremely well in protecting the local population and the large number of refugees.General Nash is just one person who served the Irish well overseas.  A retired member of the Defence Forces, John Ging, had a distinguished career in the Army and served in the Congo, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo and Rwanda.  He is now director of the UN Relief and Work Agency in Gaza, which has a budget of about €400 million.  His was the voice we all heard last year during the Israeli Palestinian conflict.  He risked his life.  There were a few assassination attempts on him.Ireland's role in peacekeeping is very important, in spite of the myths that were put out during the debates on the Lisbon treaty.  We have the triple lock system in place with respect to the deployment of troops abroad.  The Dáil, the Government and the UN must give the go ahead for such operations.  It is an important area and it is important for our troops to get experience.  Joining the European Defence Agency was extremely important.  It will give our troops more experience.  It is obviously important that they work with member states of the European Union.  The EU should be more effective on the world stage and should have a meaningful role, with the best equipment.  Troops sent abroad must have the best equipment to deal with conflict that comes up in their role as peacekeepers.  That is very important for the safety of our personnel and for their training.We support this Bill.  I am delighted the Minister has brought it to the House now.  It will get a speedy passage through the Dáil.

Bhí an foilsiú seo tábhachtach ó thaobh oscailteacht agus trédhearcachta de.  Molaim an t-Aire faoi sin.  Bhí eagla ar dhaoine áirithe faoin arm Eorpach agus faoi choinscríobh.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an t-eolas go léir faoi chúrsaí cosanta agus neodrachta ar fáil i gconaí.  Ba cheart a rá um an dtaca seo, áfach, nár chuir conradh Liospóin an Ghníomhaireacht Eorpach um Chosaint ar bun.  Cuireadh an ghníomhaireacht ar bun i 2004 faoi Uachtarántacht na hÉireann.  Tá an tír seo mar bhall den ghníomhaireacht ó shin.  Níl iachall ar aon stát den Aontas Eorpach bheith ina bhall den ghníomhaireacht, dár ndóigh.  Beidh Partí an Lucht Oibre ag tacú leis an mBille tábhachtach seo.The Labour Party will support the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009.  I compliment the Minister for Defence for publishing this Bill on 7 September 2009, well in advance of the vote on the Lisbon treaty.  This was proper openness and transparency and ensured that the text of the Bill was public before votes were cast in the referendum on October 2.  There were fears among the electorate regarding the creation of a European army and even of conscription during the course of the campaign on the first Lisbon referendum, and some of this lasted right up to the recent referendum.It bears re-stating that Ireland secured a legal guarantee on security and defence issues in June 2009.  This is legally binding.  At a later date, this document will be attached as a protocol to the European treaties.  It is a guarantee that the Lisbon treaty will not affect or prejudice this country's policy of military neutrality.  There is no provision under the Lisbon treaty for the creation of a European army or conscription to any military entity.  Under the guarantee, Ireland can continue to exercise its rights with regard to matters like defence, security, expenditure and other defence capabilities.  If a member state is a victim of armed aggression on its territory, under the legal guarantee Ireland will determine what aid, if any, will be provided to that state.  The EU's Common Security and Defence Policy gives it an operational capacity to use on missions outside the Union, such as peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the United Nations principles.  At present, the EU may undertake humanitarian activities, rescue tasks and peacekeeping in the Common Security and Defence Policy area.  Task forces may also get involved in crisis management, including peacemaking.  The list is being expanded under the Lisbon treaty to include disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks and post-conflict stabilisation.  The Labour Party supports this position as it is fully in line with our peacekeeping tradition.The Lisbon treaty changes nothing in regard to our traditional policy of military neutrality.  It requires the approval of all member states before any crisis management mission can be embarked on.  Ireland retains the right to decide on its participation in any mission that is subject to the triple lock arrangements.  There must be a UN mandate and the mission must be approved by the Government and the Dáil.  Furthermore, our Constitution requires that there must be a referendum seeking the prior consent of the people before Ireland can participate in a common UN defence.  The Lisbon treaty states that if a member state is a victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other member states shall provide aid by all means in their power in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations charter.  However, it is made clear that this obligation shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policies of certain member states.  In effect, this means Ireland will not be bound by any mutual defence commitment.The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 gives effect to the provisions of the national declaration on the Lisbon treaty in relation to the European Defence Agency and permanent structured co-operation.  As no law on the provisions of the national declaration relating to the agency and permanent structured co-operation has been implemented to date, Ireland's participation will require the approval of the Dáil in accordance with Irish law.  The Bill before the House addresses this matter.  In essence, the legislation confirms that Ireland's participation in certain European Defence Agency projects and programmes and in permanent structured co-operation will be subject to the prior approval of the Government and the Dáil.  The Government must be satisfied that such participation would enhance the capability of UN-mandated missions engaged in peacekeeping, conflict prevention or the strengthening of International security in accordance with the principles specified in the charter of the United Nations.  In effect, this extends the triple lock mechanism to the agency and to permanent structured co-operation.  Ireland has an obligation to contribute to the budget of the European Defence Agency.  Other than that, there are no specific obligations on Ireland.  National decisions on participation in the agency's various projects will be taken on a case-by-case basis.Section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 sets out the arrangements for the approval of Ireland's participation in projects and programmes under Articles 20 and 21 of the Council's joint action 2004/551/CRSP of 12 July 2004, which established the European Defence Agency.  Section 3 deals with the arrangements for approving Ireland's participation in permanent structured co-operation.  This is provided for in Article 42.6 of the Lisbon treaty.  The short Bill before the House does not have a published explanatory memorandum.  Ireland joined the European Defence Agency when it was established during the Irish Presidency in 2004.  The agency was set up to support the member states and the Council in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain European security and defence policy as it stands and develops in the future.  The joint investment programme on forced protection has a three-year budget of €55 million.  I understand that Ireland joined the programme in 2007 and has contributed €700,000 over the past three years.  The Labour Party welcomes Ireland's key interest in the programme, which is in the development of technologies and capabilities to protect troops from threats such as snipers, booby traps and improvised explosive devices.  We also welcome the fact that body armour sensors and counter explosive devices are key elements of the programme.  We are pleased that Ireland is participating in the European Defence Agency's code of contact for defence procurement and code of best practice in the supply chain, which have been developed to ensure transparency in procurement and security supply of defence equipment.  We are glad the agency has developed a European bulletin board to act as a single portal for defence contract opportunities.  In these days of financial crisis, anything that enables wider advertising of Ireland's Defence Force contracts to achieve better value for money for Ireland's expenditure on defensive equipment is to be welcomed.It is important to emphasise that the European Defence Agency is not a new body that has been created under the Lisbon treaty.  The agency supports EU countries in buying necessary equipment for their defence forces more effectively and in sharing technology research.  Its main purpose is to make sure that the humanitarian work done by the EU is made easier and that soldiers involved in EU missions are better prepared.  In light of the changing nature of peacekeeping, every army that takes part in peacekeeping missions, including the Irish Army, must upgrade its military equipment at all times.  The agency will help Ireland to get its military supplies cheaper, while appreciating that we have the same equipment as other EU countries.  It should be emphasised that no article in the Lisbon treaty obliges any state to spend money on arms — the treaty cannot force any state to do so.  While the Lisbon treaty officially recognises the agency, it is not a new institution.  It is a matter for each EU member state to decide whether to participate in it.The two distinct mechanisms established under this Bill are designed to encourage military capacity-building.  The key concept underpinning the Bill is neutrality.  It is important that we reflect on the concept of Irish neutrality.  From the point of view of Irish law, it has neither operational parameters nor any necessary legal status.  The Hague Convention of 1907 formulated an exhaustive definition of the concept of neutrality.  Ireland was not a signatory to the 1907 Hague Peace Conference, which is understood to have established the basic tenets of neutrality.  The conference agreed that the substance of the principle of neutrality could be captured in two short articles, one stating the territory of neutral powers is inviolable and the second stating that belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral power.  However, Ireland has, since the Second World War, departed from this strict version of neutrality.  Prior to joining Partnership for Peace, the Department of Foreign Affairs indicated that Irish neutrality required only that Ireland not actively participate in belligerent alliances.  It is stated that Irish military neutrality is a policy to which this Government is deeply attached.  It is a policy espoused by successive Governments and its core defining characteristic is non-membership of military alliances.Ireland cannot enter belligerent military alliances but the Irish concept of neutrality was sufficiently flexible to accommodate the provision of logistical support to one or more belligerents.Neutrality is not mentioned in the Constitution, which addresses Ireland's foreign affairs powers only indirectly.  Article 29 states:1. Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.2. Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.3. Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.It is interesting that nothing in Article 29 obliges Ireland to be neutral or prohibits the Government from departing from this policy.The report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution noted:The Review Group considers that, in constitutional terms, the Articles cited above [in this case, Article 29.3], besides committing the State to peaceful resolution of conflict, establish a proper balance between Dáil control over the State's involvement in armed conflict and freedom for the Government to conduct external relations in the national interest.  Neutrality in Ireland has always been a policy as distinct from a fundamental law or principle and the Review Group sees no adequate reason to propose a change in this position.Ultimately all deployments by the Defences Forces must have Government and Oireachtas approval and must operate under a UN mandate.  The position is that although the Constitution grants the Executive almost complete power in terms of prior foreign policy, the convention of the triple lock amounts to a voluntary alienation of that power of military deployment to the UN Security Council.Interestingly, the triple lock mechanism has no formal standing in legislation and is perpetuated only as a convention of the Executive.  There has been extensive controversy in regard to the triple lock mechanism as the requirement for UN approval has checked Irish participation in humanitarian missions with EU approval but not UN approval.  Thus, because of the Chinese veto at the UN Security Council in 2003, Ireland was precluded from participating in subsequent EU action aimed at keeping warring ethnic factions apart in Macedonia.I will outline the legal background against which we must deal with this Bill.  There is no legal or constitutional restriction on, or definition of, neutrality.  As neutrality has no legal status it would be difficult to attempt to restrain a particular exercise of military power by the Government.  With the exception of declaring war, or subject to the normative expressions of belief in the benefit of specific conflict resolution, the Government may exercise its discretion as it deems appropriate.  It would be extremely difficult to curtail the foreign policy prerogatives of the Government by judicial review.  The policy of neutrality is bespoke to a certain extent and may be crafted by the Government as it sees fit.  State neutrality has, since Ireland's membership of the United Nations, been governed by the policy of the triple lock.  This policy essentially precludes the physical deployment of Irish personnel in the absence of a UN mandate.I draw the Minister's attention to the Government's declaration to clarify the meaning of the Lisbon treaty:The Treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.It will be for Member States — including Ireland, acting in a spirit of solidarity and without prejudice to its traditional policy of military neutrality — to determine the nature of aid or assistance to be provided to a Member State which is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of armed aggression on its territory.Will the Minister confirm that a national response on a case-by-case basis is sufficiently robust when considered alongside the strongly worded mutual defence clause?  Some misgivings in this context are reported.In regard to permanent structured co-operation, the Minister for Defence instanced the fact that heavy-lift helicopters in Chad show the value of this mechanism.  The case was such that Ireland could not afford to maintain itself but potentially could procure the capability in concert with other small European powers under the permanent security co-operation mechanism.Irish neutrality, defined as non-participation in military alliances, sits squarely with participation in European Defence Agency programmes and projects.  In operational terms, the European Defence Agency remit extends only to issues such as procurement, research and development and the encouragement of capacity building for European defence industries.Under permanent security co-operation, the State is allowed to engage in procurement and capacity building exercises designed to facilitate the Permanent Defence Force's participation in high-intensity missions.  Does the Bill allow for military capability building for missions not definitively or absolutely yoked to UN mandates?  Does the Minister hold that there is a presumptive obligation on the Government only to authorise such deployments when that engagement will assist the State's ability to contribute to UN-mandated missions?  Is the case the same for the European Defence Agency?I look forward to the Minister's response.  The Labour Party will support the Bill.

May they rest in peace.  Their death is a reminder of the risks our men and women in uniform take in service of our country, both here and on peacekeeping missions abroad.  Our thoughts and prayers are with their families, comrades and friends at this most difficult and traumatic time.I am delighted to speak in favour of this legislation, which will greatly aid the Defence Forces in developing their capability to serve the causes of peace and justice in support of the United Nations.  As all of us who were out and about knocking on doors as part of the recent Lisbon treaty campaign will know, our defence and military neutrality policies were an important consideration for many voters.  The guarantees secured by the Government helped dispel many of the groundless and unnecessary fears raised by those on the "No" side.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	201	As everyone knows, Ireland needs a competitive indigenous business base if we are to return the country to a secure financial footing.  Our SME sector is facing serious challenges but is vital to the health of both the national and local economy.  Our small businesses employed more than 800,000 people in every town and village in the country before the worst of the of the current crisis hit.  They are valuable members of each community, they provide employment for local people and put back money into the local economy.  They also contribute billions in tax to the national finances every year.  The current crisis has hit them hard with scores shutting down and many people relying on social welfare payments.  This motion is about trying to redress that balance and seeing what we can do to keep costs low and to protect employment.The Government and local authorities have an obligation but action is needed, one way or another, to keep these viable businesses open.  In the past year, the financial institutions have been largely responsible for neglecting the type of additional assistance required to keep small businesses afloat.  Fine Gael and other Opposition parties have called on the Government to ensure the vital blood flows to the system so that businesses are kept afloat.  Financial institutions must be forced to grant overdraft facilities and finance for purchasing stock so that the shop door stays open.The motion calls on the Government to ensure that we do not do any more damage to indigenous businesses.  Retail receipts have collapsed and the Government has maintained or hiked up charges and costs to business.  Surveys published by the Central Statistics Office in the past month indicate that Government related charges are going up while market driven charges are going down.   We recognise that Government must cut costs to survive the current financial crisis, but so must businesses.  If there is to be a genuine upturn in the economy, our businesses need to be well placed to take advantage of that.The lack of access to finance and credit continues to suffocate successful businesses which need only a helping hand through this precarious period.  The National Asset Management Agency proposal does nothing to get credit lines restored to businesses in the short or medium term.  The fear of most people is that when the taxpayer has contributed €11 billion of an investment into the banking institutions this year, with a potential investment of much more through NAMA, the banks will say, "Thank you very much" and will protect their shareholders and the banking institutions but will not look after their customers.Irish economic competitiveness continues to slide as the sand on which we built our economy continues to crumble.  In 2000, the Global Competitive League rated Ireland as the fifth most competitive economy in the world.  Last month, it further downgraded Ireland to 25th position.  The warnings given by the National Competitiveness Council and by Opposition parties about the need to place competitiveness high on the Government's agenda were ignored in the past seven years.  The lack of access to finance and inefficient Government bureaucracy are serious problems which have accentuated this issue for business in Ireland.In past years, there was a temptation for local authorities to balance the books by increasing commercial rates and to use them to pay for new goods and services while there was no urgency about imposing efficiency standards or any type of reform.  Since income from building levies collapsed local government faces serious financial difficulties.  All Members of the Oireachtas have been brought before our managers and directors of services in recent times and we know that development levies have dried up and that the difficulties local authorities are experiencing in collecting the commercial rates they are owed is a serious problem and that there is likely to be a shortfall by the end of 2009.If we blindly increase building rates to balance the books, we merely prolong sustainable economic recovery as our businesses struggle.  To restore competitiveness we need to lower business costs to help them through the recession.  Our businesses already pay some of the highest energy costs in Europe and are burdened with unnecessary red tape and bureaucratic road-blocks.  These issue have been raised on numerous occasions by Deputies but the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has yet to come up with a response.While Fianna Fáil was part of the problem, we must now look at what will be part of the solution.  This week, I had the opportunity to meet the Fine Gael council group leaders and I asked them to agree motions at all local authorities to advance the proposal of keeping commercial rates at their present level for the next three years.  We need to take action such as that if we are to give viable businesses the best chance to survive the current economic downturn.  Then we can all look to a more stable and prosperous future in the years to come.Tonight's proposal is not being considered in isolation.  It should be part and parcel of a radical reform package of local government.  As Fine Gael spokesman on the environment, I put my cards on the table last May when I outlined how we could reform local government and bring the various strands of community and public opinion into the remit of local government in order to focus every unit of local government on the objective of keeping people in employment and promoting job creation.  Local government must change radically.  Tonight, we outline our commitment to freezing local business rates but we cannot continue to charge and tax businesses and families at a local level without fundamental change to how local government works.  The Fine Gael plan to overhaul local government will devolve power from the centre to the local and empower citizens with a stake in their own communities.Local government, as the connective form of government to local communities, is the best form of government to advance projects in a small way at local level which will lead to the protection and creation of jobs.  We all know that foreign direct investment will be difficult to attract to the country in the significant levels we have seen in the past ten to 20 years.  We must consider the contribution the small business sector continues to make in protecting jobs and creating employment.  Local government has suffered from an identity crisis, as it lacked a strong primary mission.  We must give it a new mission as the focal point of creating jobs.There is a strong disconnect between local authorities and their respective communities.  Local authorities have been sidelined when it comes to providing new services, with central Government either providing services directly or devolving power to an agency or quango.  It is not acceptable that Departments are funding various groups and boards established at arm's length in the community without an accountable remit to local government.  We want to see local authorities becoming the primary driver of business support and development at local level.  It will involve 95 State bodies being merged or moved under local government structures, which will save millions on administration and will make a major contribution to freezing local business rates.  Local authorities must play an integral role in dragging Ireland out of recession.  This will involve ending the widescale duplication of services among unelected bodies and bringing them under the one roof of local government to create a one-stop-shop for business and job creation incentives.  Fine Gael has also identified 53 bodies which should be amalgamated into local government, with the abolition of 42 more.  This would result in an administrative saving of more than €70 million per year to the taxpayer.We are taking on board the precarious financial situation of the country while, at the same time, looking for the best opportunities to promote business and employment.  The creation of business support one-stop-shops based in local areas should be a priority.  There is a massive potential to benefit the national and local economy via the implementation of this policy.  If local government were directly involved in this work it would revolutionise the connectivity between business ideas and local businesses and the local people who matter.  The consolidation of the many agencies involved in local government would result in taxpayers' money being saved and avoid unnecessary duplication of services.In the Celtic tiger era the system of local government has developed into an elaborate structure the country can no longer afford.  An examination of the various agencies under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment showed that a significant amount of work could be done to row back on the expansion of some agencies and the creation of new ones.  The country cannot afford such agencies at present.  An independent examination of those agencies would show they are not delivering on their remit in the way we would expect.Citizens should continue to expect the highest form of customer service from their local authorities.  We have proposed simple reforms in the structure of local government to improve services to the public and elected representatives, including a special customer service unit which would be uniform across all local authorities and based on best practice.  We wish to see savings and efficiencies rather than new taxes and charges.  We need to restore trust at local level.  Putting local authorities back into a central role in the community would result in greater community cohesion, better services, and more employment opportunities, while recognising the difficulties in the public finances in terms of Government Estimates in 2010.We are all familiar with stories we have heard from management and directors of service across the board.  Given the lack of development levies, there is a lack of funding to promote employment opportunities and investment in infrastructure and we will have to devise new ways in which to maintain service provision and jobs at local level, which is the overriding objective of this motion.I commend the motion to the House.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I thank my colleague, Deputy Hogan, for bringing this important motion before the House to highlight an issue that is destroying our competitiveness and driving the galloping horse of recession, to the detriment of businesses throughout the country, especially small and medium enterprises, SMEs.Government driven non-pay costs in Ireland compare poorly with other countries.  According to an IDA business attitude survey, charges and energy costs are a strong ongoing deterrent to energy intensive companies coming to invest in Ireland.  Prices were set extremely high in response to the $148 a barrel peak for oil, but despite the subsequent collapse in the price of oil and gas, in a blatant anti-competitive move, Government price levels have not reflected that.  Currently, Ireland has the second most expensive electricity charges in Europe.The Minister should consider the knock-on effect for our local regions, as high unemployment and closing businesses tear the economic viability from rural and urban communities.  With a terrible sense of history repeating itself, the slowing of the live register can be attributed to one fact only — emigration.  That is a word that dominated the post-war years up to the 1980s and impacted on generations.  It is now to be the legacy of the Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government.It is interesting to see the complete lack of impact the current Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is having on the red tape that immobilises businesses.  That was also a feature of the Minister's previous portfolio, with which she failed to get to grips, something to which our farmers will attest to their cost.  Her reply to a parliamentary question on the issue, which stated that her Department is charged with leading the cross-Government drive to reduce red tape, is not guaranteed to inspire confidence.My own area of Longford-Westmeath is at the heart of the country but it is certainly not at the heart of Government provision or assistance.  Across the board from health to education to infrastructure, the midlands has been consistently ignored by this Government.  Despite the economic development of Longford-Westmeath which was, until the Government pulled the plug, progressing at a steady pace, driven by local input and hard work, the Minister has now removed our competitiveness.  We are facing one closure after another, as small firms are driven out of business and large foreign investors shun high charges to go elsewhere.  Increasing costs have made it impossible to survive in a competitive global market.  Car dealerships are particularly hard hit but the Government has failed to provide incentives to rectify the fall out.Every town in the midlands is feeling the pressure.  There is a strong feeling that businesses cannot be expected to pay the same rates as when times were good.  It is imperative that rates are frozen to take account of the current economic climate.  One hotel manager in the midlands said recently that businesses are being fleeced, between refuse collection charges, water rates and high energy charges.We can forget about tourism.  Hotels in the midlands are shelling out tens of thousands of euro every week on general running costs, in an industry that is currently low on occupancy and equally low on a future.  Occupancy in some hotels has fallen by 70% in 12 months.  Lack of trade due to drink driving restrictions is forcing hotels and bars to open late and close early.  Unless the hotel industry is supported by the Government it is set to suffer the same fate as the construction industry.  The Minister should step up to the plate and provide answers and incentives.  That is what people need.The gap between price and value is as much to blame for economic stagnation as the recession and that is where the Government is to blame.  Logic would dictate that ever-increasing charges are not the way to promote recovery.  Instead, incentives, especially for small and medium firms must take the place of increased taxation.  Fine Gael will support small businesses through our SME rescue package, which will reduce local authority rates and freeze Government charges, reduce energy costs, abolish the €10 travel tax that is destroying tourism and make it easier for SMEs to win public tenders.Small native businesses are the key to recovery due to their close relationship with consumers.  Properly supported, with low cost of entry, these companies could provide a more affordable product that would fill a gap between the standardised global product and the requirements of the home market.  It is a pity I do not have more time as I have much more to say on the subject.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I will speak for seven minutes and if Deputy Tom Hayes does not come into the Chamber I will continue into his time.  Will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle indicate when six minutes are up?I welcome the opportunity to have this debate.  I welcome also the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility for employment, Deputy Kelleher.  This motion is very deliberate and specific in its intention, namely, to propose a concept this party already supports, to try to convince the Government to freeze commercial rates at local authority level.  The Minister of State will accept that when a country moves from almost full employment and boom time to recession, the priorities must change, as must the way in which we fund local infrastructure and local government.  The rules change.First and foremost, as policymakers our priority in government or in opposition must be to ensure we do everything we can to keep businesses afloat and people employed.  The cost of retaining people and preparing them for new types of employment is expensive from an economic point of view and it is also hugely stressful for the people involved.  It puts individuals and their families under pressure.  We must avoid the creation of a situation where we have a large number of long-termed unemployed people who will lose motivation, leave the country to try to find employment or, worse still, develop a reliance on the State for income.We have made a decision to ask all our councillors across the country to fight for a freeze on commercial rates to give businesses under financial pressure some breathing space in terms of the expenses they face.  The Government will be cutting its costs in the same way because we can no longer afford to survive in terms of what we currently spend on our public sector or on social welfare.  We must allow businesses to do the same.  With the reduction in the centralised funding for local authorities now that tax revenue has decreased, we cannot force local authorities to lean on businesses that are already under pressure by increasing their rate base to make up the difference to ensure that basic services are provided at local level.  The temptation exists to do that.  I have had difficult debates with our councillors in making the case that local authorities need to face tough cost-cutting decisions because they are taking a stand to keep rates at the same level they were last year.There is a purpose underpinning what we are trying to do, namely, the prioritising of employment.  I come from the town of Carrigaline in Cork which has a population of 14,000 or 15,000.  On one side of the main street in the town 14 enterprises have gone out of business since January.  Almost one in every four premises is either unoccupied or up for rent, lease or sale.  Small businesses, in particular, cannot afford to take up the extra costs local authorities face because of a reduction in the general income they get from the Exchequer.  They are the soft touch.  We are trying to protect them to ensure they can stay in business and in two or three years' time we can increase rates as businesses start to grow again and, hopefully, to employ extra people as confidence is restored in the economy and consumers start to spend again.This is battening down the hatches time in terms of the economy.  We must help small businesses.  We must give them free advice on how to restructure to prepare for recession.  We must also ensure that their cost base reduces or, at worse, stays the same to give them as much of a chance as we possibly can to allow them to survive, to keep a skeleton business in place until we have an economic stimulus and growth again.The Government amendment to the motion misses the point.  We can take specific action in terms of rates and water and refuse charges.  We could make a strong statement to businesses that we will not increase the load on their shoulders coming from local authorities for the next two or three years while Ireland tries to struggle out of this hole of recession, that they should do their best to stay in business and that we will give them all the help we can.  We are not saying that to them, rather we are saying we are stuck for money and we will target them to make up the difference or at least part of the difference.  In doing that we are increasing the pressure on them, which is resulting in the closure of many small and larger businesses.  We can do more than simply freeze rates.I note in particular the reference to energy costs in the Government amendment.  I do not know what I have to do in opposition to get the message across to the Government that it is not doing enough to reduce energy prices.  It is trying to do a considerable amount in terms of a switch to green energy, a switch to more sustainable energy sources and a move away from a reliance on carbon-based imported fuels.  I support all of that, but the priority in recession must be to reduce the cost base for businesses.  That is not happening.  Perhaps it is because we have a Green Party Minister whose philosophy is that the more expensive energy is, the less energy people will use, and that is good for the environment.  That may be a valid ideology when we can afford to do it but it is not valid when we are putting people out of business.  That is the position.  It is why it is important that the Minister of State, representing the large party in Government — which understands how to prioritise between environmental concerns, which are valid, and competitiveness concerns, which are equally, if not more, valid at present — must take a stand with the Minister.  The Minister is driven by an ideology that views high energy prices as a good thing in a world that is rightly increasing the cost of carbon charges.  There needs to be a counter-balance that addresses the cost of energy and keeping enterprises in businesses.A survey of multinationals based in Ireland, released as recently as this month, stated in regard to energy costs that, as with other years, respondents indicated that Ireland's cost base was significantly higher than in comparable locations.  When asked to compare the number of costs in Ireland, the most expensive area highlighted was energy.  Some 86% of respondents indicated that energy costs were more expensive in Ireland than in competing locations.  One company with a base in Ireland stated, depressingly, that cost is the major challenge facing its Irish operation.  It stated that virtually all offices globally have a competitive advantage over its Irish operation.  It further stated that it had no doubt that if its company did not now have a substantial presence in Ireland, it would almost definitely not establish one.  I rest my case.We must make it easier and less expensive to do business in Ireland.  We can take action, particularly in the energy area, in terms of changing the way in which we regulate the energy sector in Ireland and of not allowing energy generators to make windfall profits on the back of carbon charges, which they are required to do by regulation but for which consumers and businesses pay.  Last year, Irish consumers, namely, families and businesses paid an extra €220 million to energy companies because of the cost of carbon charges on their bills.  We have done nothing to recoup that and to try to give it back to people to boost Irish competitiveness.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	205	Deputy Tom Hayes has been detained and I speak for the duration of the period in this timeslot.I commend Deputies Hogan and Varadkar on bringing forward this motion.  Government charges are making Irish business uncompetitive.  I concur with what Deputy Coveney said.  In my town of Ennis businesses and shops on the main street have closed and have not been replaced.  Jobs have been lost and the Government has sat idly by and not offered them any hope or respite.  This motion offers some hope to those business people by proposing to take some pressure off them in terms of reducing the costs the Government places on them.The National Competitiveness Council has reported that non-pay costs compare poorly with other countries.  Ministers during the past 12 months have constantly used the excuse that we are economic victims as a small export-driven economy and that international forces are to blame for our predicament.  If this is so, those same Ministers must now acknowledge that the converse of this argument must now apply.  It is critical that our cost base as an export-driven nation be addressed.  It is not good enough nor sustainable for the Government to sit idly by allowing the business sector to deal with competitiveness issues while allowing costs under its control to escalate.  Where is the "pulling on the green jersey together" approach when we see, despite general deflation in the economy, that the annual inflation rate in State services is expected to average 13.2% this year?  Price increases have been applied across a range of public administered services, including increases in health insurance premiums of 19.4% year-on-year, in taxi fares of 8.2%, in rail fares of 13.7% and in bus fares of 13%.Irish businesses, those that have survived, have performed admirably in an absolutely horrendous environment over the past 12 months despite the banking crisis, the recession and most of all the Government which, in the first instance, has done nothing to stimulate any type of economic activity and which, more important, presided over and orchestrated this 13.2% rise in the cost of State services.Has the Government issued policy directions to its regulators and agencies to ensure that national economic and competitiveness objectives are prioritised in all regulatory decisions as recommended by the National Competitiveness Council in June of this year?  Why had Ireland the second most expensive industrial electricity prices in the euro zone — 34% above the average — at the end of last year?  Electricity prices have increased by 70% over this decade.It is interesting to look back at the Office of the Financial Regulator and its snoozing on the job.  Is it not time that all of the other regulatory officers were brought under the microscope and evaluated as to how they are doing their job?  Does the manner in which they do their job reflect the consumer who they supposedly represent or does it reflect the interests of the industry they police?Like many Deputies, I received correspondence from chambers of commerce in my constituency.  In County Clare, commercial rates have increased cumulatively by 53.7% since 2001.  Last year rates were increased by 3.8%.  Water rates have increased by 43% since 2008.There has been a water boil notice in the town of Ennis, County Clare for the past four years.  People are advised not to drink the water without boiling it.  Visitors, immunocompromised persons and infants cannot drink the water.  The businesses in the town of Ennis must pay water rates.  There is no respite.  The Government has been asked repeatedly by the local authority, Ennis Town Council, to come up with the goods promised to pay for an interim treatment plant but it will not do so.  This forces Ennis Town Council to pass that charge on to the businesses of Ennis.  This is not right.  It is not right in 2009 that the local authority cannot offer its consumers a fresh clean water supply.  What it can do, however, is pass the buck on to businesses and ask them to carry the can even more.  This is pressuring businesspeople and putting them out of business.  Jobs are being lost and they are not being replaced.  It is not right that the Government would sit idly by and fail to address the matter.  I would appeal to the Government to address this matter and come up with the money it promised four years ago to pay for the interim treatment plant.Development contributions towards infrastructure have dried up in effect over the past number of years.  The Government simply must square the circle of providing better public service for less money; this can only be achieved by overdue reform of the public service.  We, in Fine Gael, have been advocating that for many years.  Fianna Fáil has been in government for 12 years in a row and has done nothing in this regard, but the day has come when it must address that.  We, in Fine Gael, will keep the pressure on Government to do that.Companies are struggling to survive.  It has become obvious that banks are reacting to deteriorating business trends by restricting flexibility on overdraft limits.  There is a fine balance between the sustainability of Irish business and its contribution to the financing of the Irish State.In the context of local authorities now preparing their Estimates for 2010, the Minister for Finance would do well to revisit his decision of last year to increase the VAT rate and the consequential impact that such decision had on Revenue returns over the past 12 months.  The Government has already admitted that the decision to increase VAT was wrong, but it did nothing to address it.  It simply must reduce VAT in the forthcoming budget in order to reduce prices to business and consumers alike and thereby stimulate production and consumer demand.The travel tax introduced by Government in last year's budget must also go.  The Government's tourism advisory body recently called for the tax to be abolished.  Ryanair and Aer Lingus speak with one voice on this, and it is not often that they agree.  They have stated forcefully that they want this travel tax scrapped.  There is a consensus among Opposition Deputies, airlines and those working on the ground.  Why is the Government not listening to this?  The Government can see before its very eyes that airlines are pulling routes and aircraft from all of the airports throughout Ireland.In my constituency of Clare, Shannon Airport is being hit really badly.  The average cost of a Ryanair flight out of Shannon in the winter months is €10.  The €10 travel tax being imposed by the Government is crippling the airport.  The impact of this travel tax is felt by hotels, guesthouses, restaurants and shops right across the constituency, from Loop Head in west Clare to Whitegate in east Clare and from Ballyvaughan in north Clare to Killaloe in south Clare.  The reaction of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is not to bother, to let them struggle away and to let jobs be lost.  It is just not good enough because County Clare, like many counties, depends to a significant degree on tourism and a travel tax is detrimental.  Other countries such as Holland and Belgium have axed this tax.  We must do so.  I again call on Government this evening to get rid of the travel tax.Ireland needs to regain competitiveness.  The SME sector is vital to the economy.  Governments charges are running loose and strangling the SME sector.  I appeal to all Deputies, including the Government Deputies, to support my party's motion this evening to freeze Government charges until 2012.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I welcome the opportunity to address the House this evening and wish specifically to mention the vital role of costs in restoring competitiveness to the Irish economy and the broader actions the Government is taking to help the enterprise sector at this time.Let me begin by assuring the House that the Government is committed to driving down business costs at this critical time and that it views the control of such costs as vital to restoring competitiveness to the economy.  The motion tabled by the Opposition party is based on the misleading premise that Government charges are among the biggest costs faced by businesses in Ireland today.  This simply is not true.  Research undertaken by the Irish Management Institute highlighted the major cost concerns of multinationals in Ireland.  Energy and labour costs, not Government charges, were to the forefront of these concerns.  This, too, is the message we are getting from the SME sector, along with the separate issue of credit availability.  The Government has focused on the actual priorities of businesses, including energy and labour costs and is addressing these concerns.  Where Government charges are  an issue, we are determined to maintain downward pressure.I will deal first with energy costs as referred to by Deputy Coveney.  The trend of energy prices in Ireland has been downward.  Following significant energy price reductions in May 2009, since the beginning of October there has been a significant reduction in gas prices and a modest reduction in electricity prices for medium-sized business customers.  Overall, all categories of businesses, including SMEs, have benefited from significant energy price decreases in 2009.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Yes, but comparatively, which is the problem.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I will come to the good news later.  The Central Statistics Office inflation figures highlight this continuing downward trend.  The category of costs which includes electricity, gas and other fuels has declined by almost 14% in the past 12 months.  The energy regulator, responding to Government concerns about costs for large energy users, is maintaining the current reductions in network charges for large energy users until September 2010.  The regulator is now committed to factoring competitiveness considerations into its regulatory decisions.Over the longer term, the Government is investing in energy infrastructure that will ensure lower costs from new grid infrastructure through Grid25, to the 500 MW interconnector between Ireland and Wales.  The single electricity market, in operation on the island of Ireland since 2007, has also helped drive down costs through competition and economies of scale.It is the Government's view that controlling pay costs, in the public and private sector, is a key element in restoring competitiveness.  The Central Bank recently highlighted how our deterioration in international wage competitiveness threatens a quick return to economic growth.  Although it will be a painful adjustment, a reduction in unit labour costs will strengthen our longer-term competitiveness.  For most exporting firms, labour costs account for more than half their input costs.  The NCB Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers' Indices have shown a sustained and deep period of declining input costs for businesses in Ireland driven, in part, by lower wage costs.  This is matched by a decline in Irish inflation that reached -6.5% in the year to September 2009, the sharpest fall in Ireland since the 1920s.  This deflation also cushions against the effects of any nominal wage declines.  These indicators emphasise how we are meeting the challenge of restoring competitiveness through the primary means at our disposal — strict control over costs by all key players in Ireland's economy.  With the OECD predicting mild deflation in Ireland for the next two years, the prospects are good for maintaining the current downward pressure on wages and prices.On the question of local authority charges, the Tánaiste met twice this year with representatives of the City and County Managers Association to impress upon them the importance of providing a supportive environment for business and ensuring that all local charges and levies are applied in a transparent, fair and proportionate manner.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, also wrote to the local authorities earlier this year outlining a number of measures that local authorities should consider to further support economic activity.  Local authorities are aware of these needs and have already reorganised to provide one-stop shops, or equivalent services, for local small and medium-sized businesses.The Government recognises that further work needs to be done in this area and, in this regard, it welcomes the recent report of the Commission on Taxation, which recommends certain reforms that would broaden the tax base and provide additional revenue streams for local authorities.  In addition, the renewed programme for Government agreed earlier this month contains commitments around local authority reform which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, will address.I assure Members that the Government is committed to tackling costs for businesses and is taking a number of steps to this end.  I would like to highlight three areas in particular where the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been working on behalf of the business sector.  The Competition Authority, as the agency responsible for enforcing competition law in Ireland, has tended to focus its efforts, in particular its advocacy efforts, on promoting competition in the non-traded sectors of the economy.  The authority has issued a number of reports in the past few years on non-traded and professional sectors.  The Government has already agreed to accelerate implementation of the Competition Authority's recommendations to see how best they can contribute to achieving greater cost competitiveness.  A prioritised list of recommendations, based on their impact on competitiveness, was recently drawn up by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is the Tánaiste's intention to submit a report to Government before the end of the year outlining the progress achieved on the implementation of these priority recommendations.Better regulation, as referred to by Deputy Bannon, is a central part of our efforts to sustain and improve the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  It is particularly important to reduce business costs at this time when all sources of efficiency are in focus and when jobs are at stake in all sectors of the economy.  The Government is also conscious that the administrative burden of regulations falls most heavily on smaller businesses.  We have set a 25% target for reducing the administrative burden by 2012.  I believe that what gets measured gets done and that this target will drive improvements and reduce costs for business and the public sector.  My colleague, the Tánaiste, has responsibility for driving this process and is committed to delivering simplifications and savings for small and medium-sized businesses.The high level group on business regulation, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, was set up to take on board business suggestions for cutting red tape.  The group welcomes any concrete, workable ideas from the business community that can be used to reduce red tape costs for business.  The group's first report published last year identified more than €20 million of administrative cost savings for business.  I urge businesses, in particular in the small and medium-sized sector, to continue to submit practical suggestions where they feel the current burden is excessive.  I believe that the systematic approach we have adopted here will continue to deliver cost savings for business between now and the 2012 deadline and beyond.I wish also to highlight the prominence we have given to the ongoing process of reforming public procurement.  We fully recognise the importance of the public sector market for SMEs, particularly now that demand from the private sector has slowed.  Government purchasing, whether by the HSE, local authorities, agencies or government Departments, can play an important part in driving SME growth.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Hear, hear.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	212	An increased involvement of SMEs in public purchasing will allow SMEs to make the most of their potential for job creation and expansion and we have taken action to facilitate this.Last July, the Tánaiste and Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, launched a public procurement initiative to ensure a level playing field for all innovative companies wishing to participate in public tendering and to promote greater access for SMEs to public sector contracts.  To progress this initiative, the Tánaiste has asked her officials to examine any further issues which may constitute an obstacle for SMEs accessing public contracts.  These issues will be examined and addressed through the work of the procurement innovation group, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Furthermore, the Government is committed to addressing administrative burdens with regard to public procurement procedures.  The national public procurement operations unit, established in March 2009 in the Office of Public Works, has been tasked with streamlining tender and contract documentation across the public sector to reduce the administrative burden on companies and to introduce a more standardised approach to tendering for public sector contracts.  The unit has also embarked on a programme of meetings with bodies representing suppliers and potential suppliers to hear their concerns and proposals for public procurement policy.The Government is committed to helping the approximately 250,000 small businesses in this country that employ some 770,000 people.  SMEs need no reminding of the scale of the unprecedented challenges facing our business community. During the past year, exporting businesses have also been particularly badly hit by the fall of up to one third in the value of sterling against the euro, which on its own would be more than enough to create enormous competitive problems for exports to our closest and largest trading partner.To address the immediate threats to Irish businesses from the current crisis, the enterprise stabilisation fund was established in 2009 to support viable but vulnerable enterprises.  Already, more than 100 enterprises have been approved for approximately €45 million of funding.  The availability of credit to the SME sector however, remains a key concern.  That is why, as part of the bank recapitalisation package, the Government provided a number of supports for SMEs, including a commitment that recapitalised banks should increase their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% over 2008, a code of conduct on business lending to SMEs, published by the Financial Regulator and in force since March 2009, and funding for SMEs of €300 million provided by the European Investment Bank for lending through three Irish banks.In addition, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, along with the Minister for Finance, established the credit supply clearing group to identify appropriate solutions where flows of credit to viable businesses appear to be blocked.  To assist and complement the work of the credit supply clearing group over the summer, I completed a series of eight regional meetings discussing access to credit with groups that included representatives from the banks, SMEs, relevant State agencies and other business interests.  The outcome of these meetings facilitated a greater understanding of the issue at both regional and national levels and will help inform policy and future engagement with the banking and business sectors.Last month, the Tánaiste announced further measures to aid the SME sector.  Over the next few weeks, the small business forum will reconvene to assess and review the impact of the current economic situation on the needs of SMEs.  The Tánaiste also announced a significant broadening of the financial supports that the county and city enterprise boards can offer their client businesses.  Finally, this Government intends over the coming months to bring forward a national entrepreneurship strategy aimed at stimulating entrepreneurship and co-ordinating existing measures.Ireland's outward-looking policies as a small state, our membership of the European Union, and our constant focus on education, enterprise and innovation have shaped our development, enabling us to transform ourselves from an underdeveloped society into a high technology and knowledge economy, with a keen emphasis on innovation and enterprise.  Last week I was in China, with representatives of 13 Irish companies, all leaders in their fields and poised to enter strategic partnerships with Chinese companies and bodies.  This week, the Tánaiste is in North America with 35 Irish companies delivering this strong message to potential business partners — Ireland is still an excellent place to do business with and to invest in.Ireland is re-emphasising the export-led growth model, and has historically stressed the vital role that education and learning plays in building a skilled workforce for future economic growth.  Young people in Ireland now have one of the highest educational attainments in the OECD; some 40% of our 25 to 34 year olds have a third level education.  Earlier this month, the United Nations confirmed Ireland's continuing economic and social improvements when its human development index ranked us the fifth best country in the world to live in for a third consecutive year.  There are many reports that highlight the positives of doing business and living in Ireland.Ireland's attractiveness as a location for business continues to be recognised internationally.  The World Bank's study, "Doing Business 2010", ranks Ireland seventh in the world for ease of doing business.  Entrepreneurs in Ireland pay the second lowest rate of tax as a percentage of their profits. Ireland is the third cheapest country in the EU to start a business and the third cheapest for start-up business regulation.In a key sector such as information technology, Ireland is ranked first for government support for IT industry development by The Economist and fifth for overall IT environment.  This continuing attractiveness was highlighted just this week by the announcement of the significant expansion of an Internet services company, Newsweaver, in County Cork.It is also encouraging that, in this difficult economic climate, Irish technology firms remain able to raise funds.  More than €110 million in venture capital funds for indigenous technology businesses were raised in the first half of 2009, up 7% on the previous year, while the number of companies raising these funds increased by almost 35% on 2008.Beyond controlling costs for enterprises in Ireland, this Government has been preparing for recovery by reorienting our economy to ensure a resumption of sustainable growth as soon as possible.  For that reason, the Government published a blueprint last December to build Ireland's smart economy.  This blueprint involves key areas for action such as establishing Ireland as an innovation hub, building the green technology sector and investing in critical public infrastructure.The lesson from severe global recessions in the past is that weathering the economic storm is not sufficient; countries need to restructure their economies to target the next wave of economic growth.  A key part of this vision for a smart economy is the need to effectively utilise the knowledge, skills and creativity of people and translate them into innovative processes, products and sustainable jobs.In Ireland we currently have one of the highest performing clusters of high-tech multinationals.  We will continue to incentivise these enterprises to invest further in high-value research and development areas to increase exports and create employment.  We are also targeting the growth of our own Irish-based multinationals.  Creating the smart economy will nourish a high-value, research-intensive, multinational community alongside a thriving set of Irish innovative companies.  Ireland is one of the most entrepreneurial economies in Europe: as many as 2,800 people are setting up new businesses every month, a  per capita rate significantly higher than that of the EU and the OECD.We are investing billions in research and we must ensure we get maximum return for this investment.  We will intensify our efforts towards creating the best research, innovation and commercialisation ecosystem in Europe, marketed internationally as the innovation island.Just last week, Enterprise Ireland's "Big Ideas Showcase and Commercialisation Awards" highlighted Irish innovation and entrepreneurship at its best.  This ability to successfully commercialise publicly funded research is key to our long-term economic prosperity.  In this context, I welcome the renewed commitment by the programme for Government earlier this month to retain favourable treatment of smart capital for innovative start-ups and upscaling indigenous enterprises.This Government believes that a smart economy must also be a green economy.  Ireland's strategy for this green economy is focused on creating economic opportunities in high value, innovative, green technology sectors.  The high level action group on green enterprise will shortly report on means of identifying and pursuing opportunities for jobs and economic growth and its recommendations will be pursued as part of the Government's recovery and growth strategy.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	214	This is a follow on from the smart economy document that was published in December.  Since then many actions have been taken but the report of this group will form part of the Government's recovery and growth strategy.We are pursuing major investment programmes in our energy infrastructure, renewable power, and energy efficiency.  We are introducing incentives in a range of areas including for energy efficient investment by business.  We are targeting opportunities in areas like ocean and wind power, and electric vehicles, where Ireland can establish a competitive advantage.Despite the slump in global demand, our export performance has held up remarkably well, particularly in certain major sectors such as chemicals, pharma and the life science sectors.  Medical and pharmaceutical exports grew by 22% in the first half of 2009, while exports to the key export market of the United States grew by 18% over the same period, in spite of the unfavourable currency climate.  Overall, Ireland has seen modest export growth for the first six months of 2009, growth that contrasts with the double-digit export declines of some of our major trading partners.The International Monetary Fund envisages a significant return to global growth in 2010 of over 3%, which will greatly enhance Ireland's ability to benefit from an export-led recovery.  Indeed, the recent return to growth in export orders in both the manufacturing and services purchasing managers index lends credence to the prospects of an export-led recovery in Ireland.  Due to the especially open nature of the Irish economy, we aim to benefit substantially from a global economic recovery.Restoring cost competitiveness in Ireland is made more difficult by the inability to effectively devalue our currency, and the current weaknesses in the dollar and sterling, the currencies of two of our more important trading partners.  However, in spite of these difficulties, we have made good progress in controlling costs and we are restoring competitiveness.  The ESRI recently predicted that, with our current control of costs, productivity should grow by over 3% in 2010.  Combined with projected wage decreases of 2.5%, this entails a significant improvement in the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  The process of restoring competitiveness is set to continue into 2010.  Indeed, the speed and extent of our economic recovery depends on how quickly our competitiveness can be restored.I spent last week in China promoting Irish enterprise and driving partnerships with Chinese businesses.  Both the vastness of the challenges and the uniqueness of the opportunities of the global economy are all too evident in China.  It is a key market for us and one that will help drive our export growth.  I saw quite clearly that there are challenges out there but, equally, there are opportunities.  We are making progress in the marketing of Ireland as a place to invest and purchase. I am confident that with the measures I have outlined and the measures that will be included in the budget, which will be difficult for the people and cause pain and upset, we will cope with the challenge to make the country competitive so that our exports can be sold competitively and we can retain and create jobs at home.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I welcome the opportunity to address the House this evening.  I wish to look specifically at the issues relating to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and to touch on some other key points for the Irish economy.  I thank my colleague, the Minister of State for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, for allowing me to share time with him on this important issue.Local authority costs arise from their statutory and other roles in the provision and maintenance of public infrastructure, community and social needs, environmental standards, and quality of life needs.  These services are essential to the social, economic and cultural development of communities at local level and benefit all users of local authority services, including businesses.  They are funded from a number of different sources, including Government grants, the proceeds from the local government fund, commercial rates and certain local charges applying to either commercial or domestic users, or sometimes both.Local authority rates and charges are significant contributors of local authority revenue, providing approximately 28% of the budgeted local authority current expenditure in 2009.  It is important to note that the level of funding being made available to local authorities through the local government fund had been increasing over recent years and this had the effect of dampening the extent of demands on the commercial sector through rates and charges.  While the strain on public finances resulted in a reduction in the amount of general purpose grants available for allocation to local authorities in 2009, some €905 million was allocated from the fund to local authorities by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government towards day-to-day spending in local government, together with funding for local and regional roads from the Minister for Transport.  This represents a significant and valuable contribution to the local government sector.To put the situation in perspective, the Central Statistics Office's latest figures show that there has been no overall increase in water, refuse or other services over the past 12 months — there has actually been a marginal decline.  The trend for costs for services, both in Ireland and internationally, is the "user pays" model.  There is a broad consensus that this is the fairest and most equitable system of paying for vital services.  The "polluter pays" or "user pays" principle is applied in particular in respect of waste management services and water services for the commercial sector.The recently agreed renewed programme for government is committed to ensuring the financial viability of local services.  In this context, the business community should welcome reforms to a system of revenue raising which they have long felt places too great a burden on the business community.  The Minister, Deputy John Gormley, asked local authorities to give every consideration to businesses and to exercise restraint in adopting the annual rate of valuation.  The average increase on local authority rates in 2009 was 1.15%, with a number of local authorities introducing no increase at all this year.The Government acknowledges the need to balance raising revenue and supporting businesses.  We recognise that Government charges can impact on business costs, but nevertheless, proportionate Government charges are a cornerstone of funding for local authority services.  The updated programme for Government, agreed earlier this month, includes a commitment to introduce a new system for the financing of local government, ensuring the viability of local services.  The burden of local charges will be given full consideration in this process.  The value of local authority services to businesses should not be underestimated.  It includes road maintenance, water services, environmental enhancements such as street cleaning, litter control and public lighting, the services of community wardens, energy services, and services related to arts, culture, tourism and heritage, including local promotions.In practice, a reduction in rates would, in competitiveness terms, make a negligible impact on the majority of ratepayers, as they are small businesses.  However, a 10% reduction in rates would take a substantial amount of money out of the local authority system as a whole, at a time when it is already under considerable pressure.  A further consideration in this regard is the fact that a significant amount of the rates raised remain within individual local authority areas.  In this way the rates paid support local businesses and local jobs.The Government and local authority managers will continue to take a balanced and prudent view and will continue to bear in mind the concerns of business at this difficult time.  Local authorities are well aware of the pressures on their business and commercial customers, engaging as they do locally with business chambers and other organisations.  The local authorities are also very conscious of the financial realities currently facing Ireland but indicate, however, that rates are not a significant barrier to doing business here.The Government's water pricing policy requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from non-domestic users of these services.  Full costs include the marginal capital cost, meter installation and ongoing operational and administrative costs.  The non-domestic sector includes all industrial, commercial, agricultural and institutional users of water and waste water services.  Implementation of the pricing policy is in line with the requirements of the European Union water framework directive, under which member states are required to recover in full the cost of providing water services from the users of these services by 2010.The renewed programme for Government also included a commitment to introduce charging for treated water use that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.  The Commission on Taxation report also raised the issue of domestic users paying for treated water, which would result in a more equitable sharing of the burden on businesses in this regard.  Forfás undertook an assessment of water and waste water which was published in September 2008.  The recommendations contained in the report are being actively considered within the Department and the local authority system to ensure that we manage our water resources in the most efficient and effective manner.  In addition, the Department is currently undertaking a value for money review of water services.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has signalled his intention to bring forward legislative proposals to allow for greater flexibility in setting the landfill levy.  This is required to divert material from landfill which can be beneficially used in industries such as composting.  It has the potential to add value to what has previously been seen as waste and to create significant employment opportunities.  It will also contribute to meeting the targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.  Failure to meet the targets set out in the landfill directive could result in significant fines being imposed on Ireland.Local authorities have a key role to play in supporting and promoting business at local level.  It was against this background that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, wrote to each county and city manager earlier this year asking that county and city councils establish a business support unit to act as a point of contact to ensure a quick, co-ordinated response to businesses from local authorities in areas such as planning, water and roads.  Business units or other similar arrangements have now been established.  They are there to assist individuals and businesses seeking advice and direction on business start-up and expansion.  Such support is always important, but never more so than in our current economic circumstances.I have already referred to the report of the Commission on Taxation and the renewed programme for Government in the context of the need for a widening or realignment in the funding of local government.  The Government took steps recently to provide a new source of funding for local government through the introduction of a charge on non-principal private residences.  This charge, which has only been in existence for some weeks, has already raised over €25 million which is going directly to local authorities for the provision of local services.  The Government considers that this local charge is a significant development in the financing of local government and for the revenue raising capability of local authorities for services and projects they wish to deliver locally.The essence of local government is that it is local.  Local variations in expenditure, income and rates of charges in respect of various services are, therefore, an inherent feature of the Irish local government system.  Charges take account of local circumstances and priorities and represent decisions of democratically elected local bodies.  Many of the services provided by local authorities are availed of by local businesses or especially the customers of such businesses.  These services must be paid for and commercial rates remain one of the current forms of local government financing.Achieving future sustainable economic growth will demand that Government, business and all stakeholders continue to work together to ensure we get to a stage beyond the current crisis and once more equip ourselves to benefit from an upturn in international markets.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank Fine Gael for tabling the motion.  I have indicated my concern in this regard throughout my tenure as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The committee has been examining on an ongoing basis the bureaucracy and regulation to which businesses throughout the country have been obliged to submit.  This includes the cost of various licences, registrations and fees that have to be paid, either at local or national government levels, to Government agencies or whoever.  It is not just a question of the amounts but the multiplicity of charges businesses face.  They are subject to commercial rates, water charges, development contributions etc.  These charges increase year on year and damage competitiveness in the process.We are all acutely aware of the importance of competitiveness.  We in the Labour Party are focusing on our own policy document in this regard, which shows how Ireland has lost its place in the competitiveness league.  While the Fine Gael motion is laudable and noble, to freeze local authority rates, while welcome in many quarters, is too wide-sweeping an initiative.  It could result, ultimately, in extra burdens being placed on many workers and on those on social welfare, as local authorities seek to make up the deficit as a result of such freezing.  The thrust of the motion appears to be that commercial rates should be frozen at their existing levels for the next three years.  While this might be politically attractive, without alternative sources of finance being put in place, it is utopian.  We must face reality.  My family has a small shop and we pay rates.  We would be delighted if the rates were abolished and everything would be grand until the day we would step outside the door and find the refuse and litter has not been cleared up.   It is not difficult, in theory, to freeze local authority charges and rates.  However, such action directly affects jobs in local authorities.I would like to see a strengthened role for local authorities as regards being in the vanguard of job creation, providing a base and local knowledge to promote employment opportunities.  One of the mysteries when I was a member of a local authority was that everyone in the place seemed to get money to provide assistance and advice and to give a boost to the community.  However, the local authority, a county-wide structure, did not get a penny.  It was starved of finance, strangled.  Somebody seemed to have had an agenda to cut out the local authorities because they were left bereft of finance at critical times.  Local authority members often had to make very difficult decisions.  I note that services in our local authority, Westmeath County Council, which were half-privatised have been fully privatised in the past 24 hours.  The council had maintained a waiver system up to this, for the benefit of the elderly, people on social welfare and those less well off.  With the recent privatisation, that has been wiped out.  This caused great angst for my Labour Party colleagues on Westmeath County Council, and they were right, notwithstanding the snide remarks emanating from some quarters.  Their concerns were to ensure that the people less able to bear the costs being visited upon them by the removal of the waiver system, which created enormous difficulties for them, should not suffer.To take that proposal in isolation would lead to paralysis and the ultimate collapse of local authorities, unless the tax base were widened or an alternative source of funding were provided.  Anyone who has served on a local authority knows that significant duties and obligations were imposed on them, deriving from the Oireachtas, without any concomitant level of finance to implement such burdens.  Even as we speak burdens are being placed on local authorities.  I therefore believe the Labour Party would not be in a position to support the Fine Gael motion, as constructed, despite its thrust being something to which everybody aspires.  The Government amendment misses the point as well, and we certainly shall not be supporting that.  It ignores the problem and is far too self-congratulatory in its tone, mode and tenor.The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will appreciate that a review of the business environment was carried out in his home county of Wexford.  Councillor George Lawlor is very diligent as regards his duty as a local representative and we are very proud of him for the role he plays in that regard.  He carried out a survey, the results of which showed that one of the biggest problems for businesses was not rates but rents.  Rents are a multiple of the rates bill for many businesses, and it would not be a profitable solution for small businesses to destroy the local government funding base and local authority jobs.  The Labour Party has been always to the forefront in trying to protect local authority and public service jobs.  These workers are out at 5 a.m. cleaning streets.  If there is an accident, they are out at 3 a.m. clearing away the fallen tree or whatever.  Those are the people on the front line who would suffer if we supported this motion in its current form, and the Labour Party would not do that.We all know about upward-only reviews of rents, tenancy and lease agreements.  That is crazy stuff and does not take cognisance of the economic environment.  This was all part of the Celtic tiger mentality that deluded people into thinking nothing was going wrong and everything was all right.Deputy Morgan, who is here, played a prominent role for the committee in going around the commuter belt while the survey was being conducted.  Commercial rates vary throughout the country and there needs to be consistency.  We have the ridiculous situation of two companies operating side by side, or perhaps the same company operating in Louth, Westmeath or Roscommon, with people paying widely different charges for the same services.  We must bring a degree of logic to this.  The relevant levels can be seen as a way to increase local funding, and this is often unsustainable.  Recently, there were a number of SME people before the committee when regulation and bureaucracy were frequently highlighted.  One such person was Mr. Patrick Cooney, the owner manager of Gleesons, a fourth generation wholly-owned Irish company engaged in the manufacture, marketing and sale of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for the home and export markets.  At the committee meeting he stated, "It appears that there is a Government agency or quango for every conceivable activity.  Generally, these boys see themselves as implementing to the letter a particular piece of legislation, without any consideration for the knock-on effects of their actions.  The sheer volume of work and paperwork necessary to provide all the various combinations with this information or that statistic is mind boggling." He is right.  Ordinary business is subject to too many inspections by various agencies, often duplicating work and bolstering irrelevant bureaucracy.  There are CSSO documents to be filled out, environmental health levies, as well as this, that and the other examination.  These initiatives may be justifiable, but there should be free-flowing unified inspection.  If people are coming to inspect for X, they also inspect for Y and Z on the same day.I want to mention oil and energy costs.  I visited a horticultural and fruit growing company recently in north Dublin, with Deputy Morgan, which directly employs 460 people on a farm site and 180  in ancillary services, a total of almost 1,000 people.  The company has an energy bill of more than €1 million, equivalent to about 35% of its costs.  It is competing with Dutch companies in the horticultural area.  There is no support within the Common Agricultural Policy for horticulture enterprises and Enterprise Ireland does not fund them either, even enterprises with that level of jobs.  The industry competes with the UK.  Gas and electricity costs are 30% to 50% higher than there for different aspects of business.  It is engaged in significant research into combined heat and power, CHP, energy models, which are particularly suitable given the need for carbon dioxide emitted by——

Approximately 35% of the CO2 the company currently produces is reabsorbed in this way and it has the capacity to use up to 6,000 tonnes of carbon if it introduces the CHP model.  However, to facilitate this would require a €500,000 grant.  Apart from this the cost of connection to the national grid was prohibitive.  We need funding to assist in the provision of CHP energy models in the company and a realistic price for energy paid to the national grid.  We need integrated joined-up thinking at Government level to ensure that energy cost, which is another significant imposition and burden on business, is tackled.I thank Deputy Morgan for allowing me half a minute extra.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I thank the Deputy for giving me nine minutes and thank the Labour Party for sharing time with me.  If everybody in the Labour Party and Sinn Féin got on as well as Deputy Penrose and I, we would have a far better left Opposition in place.  Perhaps it is to do with our mutual small business background which is our connection.The Fine Gael motion is too sweeping and unfortunately it represents a missed opportunity.  We could have been having a very constructive debate here this evening.  The motion states: "That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to freeze all charges on businesses until 2012."  Let us consider some of the businesses to which we might refer in that very wide sweeping statement, including Intel, Diageo which owns Guinness, and the Kerry Group.  Those companies can well afford to pay local authority rates and whatever moderate increase might apply.  The motion as it stands would allow those businesses to not pay their fair share.  While most businesses suffer to some degree, these guys can certainly afford to pay and should pay.The other major impact would be on the funding for local government.  We know that central government has simply not been funding local authorities for decades, which is having a significant negative impact.  If it were not for all the building and planning levies flowing into the coffers of local authorities in the past decade they would have continued to remain on their knees.  As that building boom came the local authority system grew with it, but now it is in serious difficulty because of where we find ourselves.  Local authorities are acutely aware of the difficulties that particularly small and medium-sized enterprises face.I regularly hear councillors talking about the prospect of reducing rates in some cases.  If the motion is carried, all of those rates will be frozen and the local authorities will not have that little bit of leeway in any cases where there is a bit of give and take for them to reduce rates in some cases or even to introduce some kind of opportunity for those businesses that are genuinely viable but are going through very difficult conditions because of the economic crisis to, for example, postpone their rates for the time being.  I am concerned that it would have a very negative impact on them.The motion should have been more flexible thereby allowing us to have this discussion about that category of entrepreneur, the genuine small to medium-sized enterprise undergoing difficulty but where all the fundamentals are sound and so that it could employ three or four people — for example a small printer — up to something of the scale referred to by Deputy Penrose, the Dublin Meath Growers Society with almost 500 people employed.  There should be some flexibility in dealing with those.  We all know of these small enterprises.  They are in every city, town and village.  We deal with them and make representations on their behalf on a regular basis.  Those entrepreneurs need a stimulus package from Government, which brings me to the Government amendment.Unfortunately that amendment engages in unwarranted back patting, which is not appropriate given the state of the economy that has been presided over for a very long time by the larger party in the Government which brought us to where we are now.  The amendment "commends the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for calling on local authority managers to implement measures open to local authorities to support new or existing enterprises in their areas by, for example, reducing development contribution rates".  It is all right for the Government to call on local authority managers to do that, but what is the Government doing to help those local authorities?  As soon as we begin to examine it we see it is not doing anything.The one thing missing from the debate on the economic crisis to date has been a stimulus package for enterprise to assist job retention and creation.  There is a minor package for a certain limited category of business which is exporting but it is far too limited.  We know about the Government's NAMA enterprise, to which I may have time to return in a few moments.  Its main economic drive of slash and burn will squeeze the life out of the economy.  It is taking the few bob out of people's pockets and thus crippling the economy completely.Let us consider just one area where that is happening.  Only half of the education capital budget has been spent so far.  Some €391 million of an €840 million package is still sitting there.  What would that money have done for the economy had the political masters in that Department gone out there and made it happen?  It would have been a great boost to the construction sector to get out there and start building those schools.  As it is one of the most labour intensive sectors of the economy, with that would have come a substantial employment opportunity.  However, that has not happened.  I laughed when I saw the Minister for Education and Science in the House earlier with three Ministers of State beside him.  I jocosely asked him if he thought he needed a few more Ministers of State to make this thing happen and put a bit of drive into it.  Four Ministers of State and a senior Minister should be able to get the push behind that critical spending that would act as something of an economic stimulus for the economy and that sector as well as providing better conditions for children.  Some children have been in portakabins for their entire primary and possibly secondary education.  We know the difficulty teachers as well as students have in working in those conditions owing to the poor heat and light and all that goes with it.I wish to finish up with the issue of NAMA.  We will be dealing with Committee Stage of the NAMA Bill in the Dáil Chamber later this week and next week.  In dealing with anything to do with the economy whether it is this motion or anything else we must refer to NAMA.  Unfortunately it is a bailout for bankers.  Bankers are being bolstered with taxpayers' money.  The Bill makes provision for NAMA to support developers to finish their projects.  There is no money for enterprise but there is money for the developers to finish their housing schemes at a time when there are at least 50,000 new homes without buyers and banks are not lending money to people to buy homes.  This is what NAMA is about.  It is about time the Government reconsidered what it is doing regarding the economy, banking and enterprise.  If it did so and listened to some debate from this side of the House we would all be much better off.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to raise this matter.  We speak much in the House about active citizenship.  St. Patrick's Hospital Fundraising Association in Fermoy is an example of active citizenship in practice.  It recently purchased 12 new safe patient mobilisation beds at a cost of €53,000.  These beds have made a huge difference to the patients in the hospital and assist the staff in further enhancing the already high quality of care.  It is without doubt that all of the hard work that goes into fundraising for local hospitals such as Fermoy greatly benefits the patients, most of whom are elderly.All of this money was donated by the local community for the association, which is a registered charity.  It is estimated that the association in Fermoy has raised over €100,000 between 2006 and 2009 in order to purchase appliances and equipment.  Recently, a 30-bed unit was built at the community hospital in Fermoy and the association contributed €460,000.  There is no doubting the very valuable and hard fundraising work that is carried out by people like those in Fermoy.  Other groups in my constituency, such as those in Youghal, Midleton, Cobh and Mallow also have worked and continue to work very hard fundraising on a voluntary capacity to raise funds to purchase much needed equipment for their local community hospitals in order to support front line services.  I am sure it is the same all over the country.  Not one cent is wasted, unlike money in the charge of many State agencies, examples of which are well known.To come back to the purchase of the safe patient mobilisation beds, costing €53,000, the Minister for Finance showed his gratitude to the people of Fermoy by charging VAT to the tune of 21.5% on the purchase.  The Minister has set a threshold of €25,390 on each individual item in order to qualify for relief under the VAT refund order, SI 58/92.  Even though the beds were one order, the purchase does not qualify for the relief because the refund only applies to medical equipment costing in excess of €25,390.  The Minister charged a VAT bill on the purchase of €11,000.  Imagine all the cake sales and raffles that had to be held in order to raise €11,000 simply to hand it over to the Minister.  Imagine what could have been done in the hospital with that money, which was raised on a voluntary basis.I call on the Minister to consider doing two things.  First, he should reduce the threshold, and there is an opportunity to do this in the Finance Bill.  Second, he should consider the purchase of items such as these beds as one item so that the VAT relief can be allowed to the voluntary association.  This would encourage groups to continue to raise more money.  It will save the State in the long run and do much good for those in real need in our communities.  If the Government is really serious about active citizenship, it should encourage this kind of active citizenship on the ground, which is happening as we speak.  I await the Minister of State's reply.  I hope this will not end here but will go further.  Perhaps we can do something constructive on this matter.

Non-profit making organisations and voluntary groups that are engaged in the supply of goods and services closely related to welfare and social security, such as hospitals, are exempt from VAT by virtue of paragraph (vii) of the First Schedule to the Value-Added Tax Act 1972.  This exemption from VAT, which applies across all EU member states, means that such organisations or groups do not register for VAT; they do not charge VAT on their supplies of goods and services; and they are not entitled to credit for VAT incurred on goods or services acquired by them.  In this regard, where a hospital purchases a good or engages a service, any VAT liable in the charge for that good or service must be borne by the hospital.However, there is provision within the Irish VAT code for the refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of a new medical instrument or appliance by a person who donates the medical equipment or appliance to a hospital.  The Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 23) Order 1992 provides that certain conditions must be met in order for a VAT refund to apply: in the first instance, the appliance or instrument must be donated to a hospital; the order applies to any new instrument or appliance, excluding means of transport, which has been designed and manufactured for use solely in medical research or diagnosis, prevention or treatment of an illness; the Minister for Health and Children must recommend that a refund of tax under the order is appropriate, having regard to the requirements of the health services in the State; it is a condition of the order that no part of the funds used to purchase the goods be provided directly or indirectly by the State, a State body or any public or local authority, or indeed by the hospital to which the equipment is donated; and, finally, the amount on which VAT is chargeable must exceed €25,390 in order to qualify.  Therefore, individual medical instruments or appliances costing less than €25,390 do not qualify for a VAT refund under the scheme.The effect of the order is to allow a refund of VAT paid on qualifying medical equipment purchased through voluntary donations.  When the refund order was originally introduced in 1987, only partial relief was granted.  However, since the order was amended in 1992, the relief applies a full repayment of VAT.  In recent years, the number of repayments claimed under the medical donations refund order was 21 in 2007; 13 in 2008; and 22 to date in 2009.  The cost of these repayments amounted to €483,000 in 2007; €196,000 in 2008; and €903,000 to date in 2009.A similar VAT refund order was introduced in 1995 for the repayment of VAT incurred in the donation of any new instrument or appliance to a research institution or a university, school or similar educational body engaged in medical research in a laboratory.  Similar conditions are attached to this order, including the minimum value threshold of €25,390.  The VAT refund order was introduced to help defray the cost of more expensive items purchased by voluntary donations.  Items costing less than the threshold of €25,390 are excluded from the relief in order to limit the relief to more expensive medical equipment.The current threshold level has not changed in the 22 years since the refund was introduced in 1987 at £20,000, which was translated to €25,390 to coincide with the introduction of the euro in 2002.  Given increasing inflation since the introduction of the current threshold, the value of the threshold has reduced significantly in real terms.  Taking inflation into account, the 1987 threshold would equate to approximately €46,500 in 2009 values.  In this context, a greater level of lower priced medical appliances now qualify under the order than when the relief was originally introduced.  In the circumstances, therefore, there are no plans to change the current threshold.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue.  There was a great welcome in 2001 when the new primary care strategy was unveiled.  It set very ambitious targets in regard to the roll-out of primary care teams throughout the country.  Indeed, the target set at the time was for over 500 primary care teams to be implemented and established throughout the length and breadth of the country.  According to the HSE website today, there are 120 primary care teams up and running.It is important to go back to the reason that the primary care strategy was introduced, namely, because it is estimated that 90% to 95% of the interaction that people need with their health service can be delivered at a local level, in the local community, in an environment that is more appropriate to their needs, more convenient and more accessible.  We need to move away from the traditional system in Ireland of having a greater reliance than is necessary on the acute hospital system.It is important that we implement the 2001 strategy with a greater degree of urgency.  Progress thus far has been slow.  While a certain number of primary care teams have been established, with excellent outcomes for the communities concerned and the patients they serve, there is potential for much greater progress throughout the State.  In particular, I propose to highlight the situation in Cork county and city.There is no doubt that our traditional system of patients accessing the acute system via GP referral is overly cumbersome and bureaucratic.  People who do not need to enter an acute hospital environment are forced to go through the system, which can be slow and expensive.  In many cases, patients' needs could be met at a local level if an appropriate primary care facility were available in their community.  Primary care teams can provide a range of services, including GPs, practice nurses, community nursing services, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, home care and support staff and so on.  In addition, primary care team members can link in with other community-based disciplines to ensure all the health and social needs of the community are provided for, including speech and language therapy, dieticians, mental health services, counsellors, psychologists, chiropodists, dentists and so on.Last June I spoke in an Adjournment debate about the situation in my home town of Carrigaline where the Health Service Executive has acquired a suitable site to develop a primary care centre.  Planning permission has been granted for a state-of-the-art facility and a budget of more than €4 million was allocated for this purpose in the executive's capital plan.  However, the project continues to await sanction because of the review of that plan.  This is symptomatic of what is happening with other projects throughout the State which have unfortunately been stalled because of budgetary issues.The simple economic reality is that we will save money in the long term by investing now in primary care centres.  An effective primary care network keeps people out of the bureaucratic and expensive acute hospital environment where the vast majority of them do not need to be.  More people are likely to interface with the health service if services are available at a local level.  That is far preferable to having to travel, once an appointment is eventually secured, to a busy acute hospital environment.  It is a question of better outcomes for patients and better value for money for the taxpayer.  It makes sense to provide the vast majority of health and social services at a local level where people can access them in a convenient manner and where they can hope to achieve the best possible outcome.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's update on the roll-out of primary care centres in Cork city and county.  Some progress has been made in this area but there is potential for much more if the political will is there.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it affords me an opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to developing community-based services at local level.The Health Act 2004 provides the Health Service Executive with responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  In line with the Government strategy, Primary Care — A New Direction,  the executive is refocusing its services in order to provide people with direct access in the community to multidisciplinary teams including general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, physiotherapists and occupational therapists.  This is designed to maintain people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, decrease hospital attendances and facilitate early hospital discharge and supported care at home.The HSE plans to have 530 primary care teams in place by 2011.  Of that number, almost 130 are already in place and it is intended to have 210 in place by the end of 2009.  Of the planned overall total of 530, 138 of the teams will be in the HSE southern area, including 66 teams within Cork city and county.  The HSE southern area's target is to have 63 primary care teams in operation, that is, holding clinical team meetings on individual client cases and involving GPs and HSE staff, by the end of 2009.  As at 30 September, there were 39 teams in operation in the area.  Of these, 13 are in operation in Cork city and county, serving a population of more than 90,000 persons.  Another 20 primary care teams in Cork city and county are at various stages of development, with at least ten due to become operational by the end of this year.The HSE is reassigning staff working in primary, community and continuing care services to work in primary care teams.  The executive also intends to redeploy into community services a significant number of staff from acute hospitals and corporate functions.  Where possible, primary care teams are based in a single facility to provide easy accessibility for patients and to enhance multidisciplinary teamwork.  However, teams are working very effectively where they are not co-located.  Although they are not in a single building, they still come together for clinical team meetings.  Information technology usage facilitates team working among members who may be based in separate locations.As part of budget 2009, the Government announced its strong support for the Health Service Executive's innovative proposal to fast-track the roll-out of new primary care centres in collaboration with the private sector through leasing arrangements.  The HSE has indicated that, to date, its board has approved a total of 19 locations in Cork city and county to proceed with negotiations with interested parties to secure leasing arrangements.  One agreement for lease has been signed and 14 letters of intent have issued.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter for discussion.  Recognising the serious financial situation in which farmers find themselves, will the Minister of State consider arranging a payment schedule over a number of years to accommodate those farmers who have been asked to make a repayment as a result of inadvertent over-claiming in respect of various agricultural schemes?  In the middle of this year, the farmers in questions became aware through various communications from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that they had inadvertently over-claimed in respect of, in some cases, very small parcels of land where farm buildings had been built, roads developed or scrub had grown.  These errors were identified through the Department's sophisticated mapping system.Farmers who had claimed such land as forage or as available for grazing were found to have over-claimed, a completely inadvertent error in the majority of cases.  In some cases, it was found on appeal that the mistake was on the Department's side.  Nevertheless, the obligation to repay the moneys in question has placed a significant burden on the farming community.  As I understand it, the sums are accounted back to 2005.  In many cases of which I am aware, the sum owing amounts to in excess of €1,000.  Moreover, written communications from the Department have been somewhat confusing, with requests for repayment coming in dribs and drabs and an apparent lack of co-ordination.  For example, a farmer may receive a bill today seeking repayment in the sum of €70, and another letter tomorrow requesting repayment of a further sum of €250.  I have spoken to farmers who have received six or seven such letters.Will the Minister of State undertake to ensure that every farmer receives a clear communication as to the total over-claim amount?  Many farmers may encounter difficulties in discharging the amount due given the difficulties they currently face.  As well as an especially poor summer, they are coping with low prices for global commodities such as milk and beef.  In addition, decisions the Government has had to implement because of the constrained financial circumstances in which we find ourselves have had an impact.  For example, entry to REPS 4 is being discontinued for those farmers leaving REPS 3, and there has been a reduction in the disadvantaged area payment.  All these factors have combined to create a difficult and dreadful year for most farmers.  For that reason I would ask that special circumstances be put in place and an opportunity be given to farmers to pay back the moneys owed over a period of time.  Some farmers still have to go through the appeals process and based on what I have seen already, some will be found not to owe that money.  Notwithstanding that, we need to look at the issue.I ask that the individual farmers be paid in full this year and when the appeals process is over, a deduction of a quarter of the total overpayment be taken back and so on for the following three years until 2013.  That would be fair and equitable.  It would give farmers an opportunity to make recompense, recognising that it was not a deliberate attempt by them to claim extra money.  It was inadvertent due to buildings being placed on the land, or due to roads being constructed, or due to the growth of scrub.  An approach like this would be seen as fair.  In many cases where the farmer submitted the claim, it was done on the advice of Teagasc, or even prepared by people within Teagasc.  I am sure there was no intention on their behalf to overclaim, but it was just a mistake that was detected by the sophisticated mapping system based on satellite photography that the Department has in place.I ask that leniency be given, allowing for the difficult circumstances in which farmers find themselves, and that a payment schedule be made.  Given that the single farm payment runs out in 2013, the payment can be scheduled to fall into line with payments that are forthcoming to farmers, removing the burden on them to pay it this year.  While farmers are going through the appeals process at the moment on these overclaims, the payments due to them this year should be made, rather than holding up the entire claim awaiting the appeal.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Timmy Dooley as an gceist thábhachtach seo a ardú i mo Roinn.The single farm payment, under which €1.25 billion is paid annually to Irish farmers, is an extremely important scheme not just to the agricultural industry, but to the rural economy as a whole.  I am very pleased to confirm that almost €820 million was paid out to over 116,000 farmers in the two days since the issuing of the 70% advance payments commenced.Under the provisions of the governing EU regulations, payments under the single payment scheme may be made only in respect of eligible land and applicants under the scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels that are available to them.  Details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on my Department's land parcel identification system.  Details of the use and area claimed for each of around one million parcels on the LPIS system are registered and continually monitored by my Department.In advance of the closing date for the single payment scheme on 15 May each year, my Department sends pre-printed application forms to each applicant and these include a list of parcels declared by the applicant in question the previous year.  It is the responsibility of all applicants to ensure that the details in each year's application are accurate.  Therefore, applicants are advised of the need to confirm their right to declare such parcels and to make the appropriate deductions to the area of eligible parcels as necessary, such as where a house or other building has been constructed, and to submit maps with their applications to allow accurate deductions to be made.  It is also necessary for applicants to exclude ineligible features such as scrub, roadways and so on.  Therefore, the LPIS database has to be amended on an ongoing basis to reflect any permanent changes such as parcel boundary changes, addition of new parcels and so on.The European Commission has recently imposed very significant adjustments — known as corrections — on many member states for not carrying out sufficient checks to ensure that applicants adhere to the regulatory requirements governing the SPS and rural development area-based schemes.  Ireland is one of those member states in respect of which the commission services are continuing their audit process.  My Department initiated a process whereby the ortho-photos of land parcels declared by applicants were reviewed.  If it was deemed that some of the area of the parcels reviewed was ineligible arising from house-sites, farmyards, ponds, trees and scrub, the ineligible areas were deducted from the claimed area and payments in respect of the period 2005 to 2008 were re-calculated.In the vast majority of cases, the applicants were making sufficient deductions for the ineligible features that my Department digitised from the original parcels, as required under the EU regulations.  Therefore, there were no over-payments in these cases.  However, cases have been identified where it initially appears that the claimant in question has not made sufficient allowance for ineligible areas, thereby raising the possibility of incorrect payments having been made.Mindful of the potential financial implications for those farmers facing re-calculations following the identification of apparently ineligible areas, I have put in place a robust appeal system.  Individual farmers are advised in writing of the level of overpayment identified and advised of their right of appeal.  Receipt of all appeals are initially acknowledged, each individual appeal is thoroughly re-examined and the appellant then advised in writing of the outcome of the appeal.  Should the farmer not be satisfied with the outcome of the appeal, there is the option to have the case further reviewed by a more senior official.  Ultimately, the appellant has the further option to appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office.If the farmer so wishes, my Department will arrange to have the parcel subject to the reduction inspected by an official to confirm that the Department's decision is valid, or to make any change to that decision deemed necessary.  In addition, if the Department's original decision is altered, any moneys paid by the farmers involved or offset against subsequent payments will be refunded immediately to them.These schemes are fully and partially funded by the European Union.  The relevant competent authorities in each member state are obliged to ensure that the requirements of the governing EU regulations are observed and that only valid applications that fully comply with the requirements are paid.  The administration of these schemes in each member state is subjected to close scrutiny by officials of the European Commission and the EU Court of Auditors to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met, and that the schemes are applied in a uniform manner across the European Union.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	230	This is a very simple case.  Annascaul is in the catchment area of Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibne.  Unfortunately, the child in this matter and four others in the area have learning difficulties and are exempt from Irish.  Having learning difficulties is tough enough, but to try to do it as Gaeilge is even more difficult.  As they are exempt from Irish, these children are now being taught at the secondary school in Milltown, and they are doing very well there.  The parents drop off and pick up their children at Inch every morning and evening and they are taken from there to Milltown by bus.  The round trip to and from Milltown is 85 miles.  If a bigger bus was bought, it would make a big difference to the families involved.They are exempt from Irish due to their learning difficulties.  I have spoken to the bus inspector in Kerry and he told me that his hands were tied.  I suggested that I would have to bring it to the Dáil to find out if the Minister could do something for these people.  If these children continue in the education system, it is not sustainable for their parents to be expected to afford, or to have the wherewithal, to drive 85 miles a day over a five-year period to bring them to and from school.  As it involves children with learning difficulties who are exempt from having to learn Irish, this is a special needs case.  Although they are in the catchment area of Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne in Dingle, they are exempt from the Irish language requirement.  The only alternative they have is the secondary school in Milltown.  I ask the Minister to provide for a bus with an additional three or five seats to collect the children in Inch and thereby alleviate much of the hardship of the family I have mentioned.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as an ábhar seo a ardú.  I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, Deputy Haughey.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to clarify the general position regarding the provision of school transport under the Department of Education and Science's post-primary school transport scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if he or she resides 4.8 km or more from his or her local post-primary education centre — the centre serving the catchment area in which he or she lives.  The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside.  However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside their own catchment area.  This is also known as catchment boundary transport.  I emphasise that these children can be facilitated only if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to the post-primary centre in which they live have been catered for.  Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick-up point in that catchment area.  The Deputy will be aware that the provision of school transport is a massive logistical operation that involves the transportation by Bus Éireann of approximately 135,000 children, including over 8,000 children with special educational needs, to primary and post-primary schools each day.  While individual cases involving a pupil's eligibility for school transport are brought to the Department's attention from time to time, such cases are generally dealt with under the terms of the school transport scheme.  Those who are not satisfied with decisions made by Bus Éireann or the Department may appeal to the school transport appeals board.The Department of Education and Science made preliminary inquiries today about the provision of school transport from Annascaul to Milltown secondary school, which is the issue that has been raised by the Deputy this evening.  Two separate catchment areas are involved.  The Department understands from Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme, that a small number of children from the Annascaul area who applied for catchment boundary transport to the secondary school in Milltown could not be accommodated this year.  As Bus Éireann is responsible for the planning of school bus routes and the allocation of appropriately sized buses for eligible pupils, the parents of these children should continue to liaise with the company's local office regarding the future availability of seats.  However, I emphasise that catchment boundary transport is not guaranteed.The Deputy is probably aware that the Department has commenced a value for money review of the school transport scheme, including catchment boundaries.  It is expected that the review will be completed before the end of this year.  The steering committee is examining the original objectives of the scheme, whether these objectives remain valid today, the extent to which they are being achieved and whether there are possibilities for economies or efficiencies that would improve the value for money of the scheme.  The review will also examine fundamental issues such as catchment boundaries.  When it has been completed, the review will be published and sent to the Select Committee on Education and Science.  I suggest that Deputy Sheahan should attempt to influence the findings of the review as he sees appropriate.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to do likewise.

The detailed functional specification for the Inventory has been completed and work is currently underway on building the online interface and database to hold the information.The online facility will enable schools to provide information about their accommodation, including its composition in terms of permanent and temporary structures, electronically to the Department.  The Department will also be collecting information on the age of existing school accommodation including both purchased and rented prefabs.  The inventory will also include information on size of school sites.Schools will be able to access the online facility through the Department's  Esinet portal.  Initially it is planned that a small number of schools will be given access to the facility for testing.  This is scheduled to take place in November.  It is expected that the facility will be made available to all schools to start uploading information before the end of 2009.When all the information has been received from schools, the Inventory will provide key data and statistics on the existing school building stock throughout the country at both primary and post-primary levels.  It will enable the Department to more accurately calculate capacity in existing school accommodation and therefore identify where additional accommodation is required.When the information has been compiled and analysed, it is intended to publish  it and this is likely to happen before the end of the current school year
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 152 together.In drawing up the Revised Programme for Government all relevant issues including costs formed part of the consideration.  With regard to their specific identification the Deputy will appreciate that while some costs can be identified with a degree of certainty the costs of other elements will depend on their precise implementation.The specific education measures include a commitment to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio for the lifetime of the Government, 500 teaching posts over the next three years, funding for 28 additional psychologist posts, standard capitation grants to schools being maintained and an extra allocation being made available to schools for needs such as book rental schemes and curricular activities.The commitment to maintain the standard capitation grants to schools will not give rise to additional costs except insofar as it relates to increases in the school going population, the costing of which would form part of the annual estimates and budgetary process.  While the precise costs of the additional teaching posts cannot be determined until the actual appointments are made it is anticipated that every teacher appointed will give rise to an initial annual pay cost of approx. €46,000 on appointment rising to an average of €64,000 over time.  We plan to start allocating the first tranche of 200 posts early in the new year, with a further 150 posts to be allocated in September 2010, with the remainder in September 2011. Assuming 200 extra teachers from the beginning of next year and a further 150 teachers next September the extra pay costs next year will be in the order of €11 million and the ongoing full year pay cost when all 500 teachers are employed at average salary will be in the order of €32 million.The funding of the additional 28 psychological posts is expected to give rise to an additional full year cost of approx €2.3m.   I can inform the Deputy that my Department and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is currently actively engaging with some 13 prospective recruits to the National Educational Psychological Service for assignment in the immediate future (four by the end of October).  Discussions are now underway between my Department and the Public Appointments Service with a view to establishing a new recruitment competition to produce a panel of qualified personnel to continue the planned ongoing expansion of the Service.The exact level of additional funding for schools for the consolidated grants will be considered in the context of the estimates and budgetary process.  I can confirm that my Department is currently engaged in discussions with the  Department of Finance in relation to the precise quantum of funding needed to implement this commitment in 2010.   It is also my intention to have my Department engage with the school management bodies on the most efficient method of delivering this funding into the schools.The Revised Programme also provides for other measures which have the potential to give rise to additional costs for the education sector.  These include for example delivery of 100 MBs Broadband for all second level schools by 2012 and roll out of new digital access devices for teachers and students.  In addition  it provides for the development of a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the EPSEN Act focusing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs.  However it   is not possible to give an exact costing at this early stage until the implementation arrangements are worked out.The Revised Programme for Government, which is for delivery over the period to 2012, is based on the broad macro economic framework set out in the April Budget taking account of the latest fiscal trends.  The framework recognises the need to achieve stabilisation of the public finances over the next three years involving significant adjustments in current expenditure in each year.  This correction of the public finances will take account of the Report of the  Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and the  Commission on Taxation while creating room for targeted spending and taxation initiatives that can be demonstrated to promote economic renewal.   Funding for  all aspects of the revised Programme, including the education measures, will be  considered over the coming weeks in the context of the estimate and budgetary  process.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a 2.4 band rating.The prioritisation criteria were drawn up following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.This band rating assigned to this school reflects the fact that there is a deficit of mainstream accommodation.  However, this deficit does not represent a substantial or significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation needs. The band rating also takes into account the fact that a refurbishment is required which is not extensive in scope.  The next step with this project is for a design team to be appointed. I will consider the project, together with all other large scale building projects, in the context of the projects to be progressed in 2010 taking into account its band rating and the level of demand on my Departments capital budget.However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the  Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	236	For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or guardians, dependent mature students or as independent mature students. An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding entry to an approved course.When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that parental income must be taken into account.  Independent mature students, on the other hand, are assessed without reference to their parents' income. The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the candidate only and of his or her spouse where appropriate.In order to establish a candidate's status as an independent mature student, documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate's address from 1st October of the year preceding entry to college. In considering whether a mature student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.The documentary evidence normally required by a local authority or VEC to establish independent residence includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas or ESB bill, evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies  Board or official documentation received at the address, for example, from a Government Department. In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to produce such proofs of residence in the relevant period for demonstrable reasons, the awarding authority may, at its discretion, agree to accept other documentary proofs.  While an affidavit, if accompanied by other supporting documentation, may be considered as evidence of independent living, an affidavit in isolation is not considered acceptable as sole proof of residency.The Deputy will be aware that, in witnessing an affidavit, the role of a  Commissioner for Oaths or practising solicitor is to witness the signature of the person making the affidavit.  They do not verify the contents of the affidavit. An affidavit is generally confined to such facts as the person swearing it is able of his or her own knowledge to prove.  It is considered that it is likely to be of little value where a candidate is unable to provide any form of documentary evidence to support his or her assertions in this regard.My Department has reviewed the use of affidavits in the context of proof of independent living and is satisfied that the current practice in this regard is both reasonable and appropriate.

In general most schools address the individual needs of these children without recourse to additional targeted resources.  Evidence has shown that disadvantage associated with poverty and social exclusion assumes a multiplier effect where the levels are highly concentrated in schools.DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). As a result of the identification and review processes, 881 schools have been included in the School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS. These comprise 679 primary schools (urban and rural) and 202 second-level schools.The plan commenced in 2006 and is being rolled out on a phased basis over the period to 2010.DEIS provides various supports for both primary and post primary schools. These include:reduced pupil teacher ratio in primary schools in urban areas with most disadvantage.allocation of administrative principal on lower figures than generally apply  in primary schools in urban areas.additional capitation funding based on level of disadvantage. — additional funding for schools books.access to the School Meals Programmeaccess to numeracy/literacy supports and measures at primary level.access to Home School Community Liaison services.access to the School Completion Programme.enhanced guidance counselling provision at post primary level.access to planning supports.provision for school library and librarian support in post primary schools  with most disadvantageaccess to the Junior Certificate School Programme and Leaving Certificate  Appliedaccess to a range of professional development supports.The renewed programme for Government reinforces my commitment to support children in DEIS schools. In particular the renewed commitment the Junior Certificate Schools programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied will ensure that children attending the most disadvantaged Post Primary schools will continue to benefit from enhanced curricular relevance and choice as well as access to specific literacy and numeracy measures.

Appointments were made to this inaugural board in April 2007 for an initial three year term.SEAB will be independent in the performance of its functions.  None of the sections in EPSEN which would allow an appeal to be lodged have been commenced as yet.However, since its establishment, the Board has developed draft procedures which it proposes to use to consider appeals once the relevant sections of the  EPSEN Act are commenced.   In considering the requirements of the appeals process which will be required under EPSEN, the Board members have examined the range of legal issues associated with such a process.  The Board members have also reviewed the outcome of judicial reviews of education decisions and looked at the structures and procedures in other Tribunal fora such as the Equality Tribunal and the Employment Equality Tribunal.The Board has also held ongoing meetings with individuals and organisations whose experience would inform the work of the Board or whose work was linked with the work of the Board including my own Department, the National Council for Special Education and the National Educational Welfare Board.  The Board has also considered the requirements for mediation as provided for under  EPSEN.SEAB does not have a separate budget.  My Department spent €9,691 in 2007 and €184,243 in 2008 on funding the operation of the SEAB.  In the current year, a provision of €100,000 was set aside to fund its operations.  €54,145 has been spent to end of September 2009.

I understand that the NCSE is currently finalising a new set of procedures for appeal of SENO decisions in relation to the allocation of teaching/SNA resources.  Under the proposed procedures appeals may be lodged by schools or parents.  The appeal will need to set out the grounds for the appeal.  The key grounds for appeal will be that the  SENO  (i) Misinterpreted or ignored my Department's policy or (ii) Failed to take due account of the evidence of the child's educational  and/or care needs or the resourcing available within the school when applying  my Department's policy.Where appeals are lodged the decision will be examined by a Senior SENO who was not involved in the previous decision and a finding communicated to the school or parent. It is expected that the new procedures will be fully operational by the end of the year.I am also informed that, in 2010, the NCSE intends establishing an independent  Appeal Advisory Committee, comprising an independent chair, a parents' representative and a school management representative.  This will consider cases where schools consider that the appeals process was inadequate/inappropriate in addressing the concerns raised or represents an irrational interpretation of the facts and application of the policy criteria.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 582 and 632 together.As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the public sector and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer.  In applying this moratorium generally, teaching and research activities in the education sector have been afforded significant exemptions relative to other areas of public expenditure. Nonetheless, the Deputy will appreciate that the sector has to contribute towards overall public sector numbers reductions.In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an employment control framework be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued oversight and review by the HEA and both my Department and the Department of Finance. This framework allows flexibility around recruitment into posts that are considered essential to maintaining core teaching and research activities, subject to an overall ceiling on numbers employed.  The Government is anxious to work with the publicly funded higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary strategy.  The employment control framework aims to enable this while providing sufficient flexibility for the protection of frontline teaching and research activities.It is a matter for the individual higher education institutions, including  Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), to manage their staffing resources in the context of implementing the framework.  I understand that, within the terms of the employment control framework, the HEA are currently in discussions with DIT in relation to options for addressing some specific operational issues that have arisen there.

In advance of such discussions it has written to the education partners to seek any observations or suggestions they may have in relation to the implementation of the commitment. This will assist my Department in identifying issues for discussion and to set a detailed agenda for the discussions.In that regard the views of the education partners have been sought on:The division of posts between the primary and post-primary sectorsThe best way to identify those schools that are "most seriously affected by  the recent increase in the PTR" and the criteria that might be applied in such  identification?The desirability of implementing the commitment in a manner through an  allocation process that keeps the administrative burden at a minimum for both  schools and the Department.The education partners have been given until Thursday 29 October 2009 to  forward their views to my Department. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the issues raised by the Deputy pending the outcome of the consultation process.

The NCSE will continue to allocate teaching and special needs assistant resources in line with my Department's policy to enable schools support pupils with special educational needs.

The general aim of the Agency is to oversee the development of the lands at Grangegorman on behalf of the  Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, Dublin Institute of  Technology and the Health Services Executive.Section 12 of the Act provides that the Agency following its establishment must  prepare a Strategic plan consisting of a written statement and a plan indicating the objectives for the development of the Grangegorman site, including the setting of a budget for the strategic plan subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Science together with a strategy for its delivery within the set budget.The draft Strategic plan and budget has been received by my Department and I intend bringing proposals to Government for consideration as quickly as possible.In relation to the DIT building in Rathmines the strategic plan proposes to dispose of this building in a manner that will maximise its disposal value as soon as alternative accommodation has been provided on the Grangegorman site.  It is proposed that the proceeds from the disposal of all DIT properties will be used to part fund the Grangegorman project.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Clustering arrangements exist within the primary system for the sharing, in certain instances, of specific resources such as resource teaching posts and also rural coordinator support.While there are currently no formal arrangements for the sharing of general resources or facilities it is open to schools to enter into local arrangements themselves e.g. in relation to pooling of existing ancillary grants so as to improve their level of secretarial or caretaker provision.My Department remains open, of course, to considering any proposal from patrons or schools on other types of school clustering arrangements or inter-school co-operation that would result in improving the efficiency or effectiveness of existing levels of resources. Ensuring we get value for money for the taxpayer is obviously a priority for me. We're continuing to find efficiencies where possible. It is incumbent on all of us that given the financial situation we deploy staff and other resources in the most effective way across the education sector.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 133 together.It is important that the decision endorsed by the Government to implement a new model of primary school patronage is adequately supported both in financial and policy terms. In general, the opening of the two new community national schools has not given rise to any expenditure over and above that normally associated with the establishment of a primary school.A Steering Group has been established to oversee the project. This Group is composed of officials of the Department of Education and Science and of County Dublin VEC. Officials of both bodies serve on the Steering Group as part of their normal duties. Start-up grants and other payments to which the schools are entitled under the Education Act 1998 have been duly paid by the Department. Principals and teaching staff have been appointed in accordance with normal practice in a start-up situation.In relation to accommodation, both schools are located in premises provided by the Department through the new Developing Areas building programme.  Scoil  Ghráinne is located in a temporary building provided by County Dublin VEC pending the construction of a first and second level VEC campus on the same site.  Recent advances in school planning and building construction within the  Department have led to considerable efficiencies and savings and consequent value for money.The development of the religious education programme being delivered in the schools is being achieved through an Action Research project assisted by a  Reference Group made up of representatives of the main faiths and beliefs and of others with expertise and experience in this area.The pilot phase of the new community national school model is, by its nature, a learning exercise. It will allow us to test approaches and to learn from and draw on experience over time. The joint Department/VEC Steering Group is now focusing its attention on the evaluation process.In order to fully evaluate the model in different settings, I want to extend the community national school pilot to a number of new locations in 2010. The addition of what is likely to be a limited number of further schools to the pilot will enhance the potential for identifying possible practical issues and trying out new solutions and will enable informed decisions to be made on the further roll-out of this new model of patronage in other locations in the future.The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social & Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. This information has been circulated to all existing school Patrons who have been invited to bring forward proposals for the expansion of existing schools or indeed to put themselves forward as Patron for any new primary school, should it be required. The extension of the community national school model will be considered in that context.In December 2007, the Government agreed proposals in relation to the development of an additional model of school patronage at primary level which covered the key elements of the new model, including the proposed approach to the religious education of children.   The Government noted that, under the pilot model, in as far as possible, provision would be made within the school setting during the school day for the religious education of children in conformity with the wishes of parents, and that the model would also cater for parents who do not wish their children to receive religious education in any one particular faith. The Government further noted that the schools would operate through an ethos of inclusiveness and respect for all beliefs, both religious and non-religious and that the practical issues arising in respect of this element of the pilot model, and the lessons that might be drawn for future-roll out of the model, would be developed during the pilot phase.It is not my intention to release a copy of the Memorandum to Government in this instance, in accordance with the provisions governing confidentiality of  Government papers contained in Section 1.5 ‘Access to Records' of the Cabinet  Handbook produced by the Department of the Taoiseach.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.Senior officials of my Department met with Archbishop Martin and other representatives of the Roman Catholic hierarchy separately in late 2007 to discuss a number of issues relating to patronage of primary schools. They discussed the different issues that might arise where one or more schools under  Roman Catholic patronage might transfer to another patron. Clearly, any such changes would need to be planned and managed and it would be important in individual school cases for consultation with all stakeholders — parents, teachers and local communities.My Department has recently been in contact with the Archbishop and other representatives of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and religious to arrange further and more detailed discussions. These discussions are to determine how best to agree a framework by which the issues of school patronage, ownership of school property, the demand for denominational education and other associated matters can be addressed. That joint meeting is scheduled to take place next month.As the Deputies will be aware, a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools is currently being undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation. Among the issues being considered as part of this review is the question of patronage and the circumstances where changes to patronage may be warranted.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	249	The ICT Strategy Group Report, "Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools" .which was published in July 2008, provides a clear direction to inform actions to further the integration of ICT into teaching and learning in our schools. The Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, reiterates Government policy to enhance the role of ICT in the education system, working in partnership with industry, to invest further in the provision of equipment and connectivity.Earlier this year, I set up the Joint Advisory Group, comprising members of ICT  Ireland, the Telecommunications and Internet Federation, the Irish Software  Association, the Department of Education and Science and the National Centre for Technology in Education, to explore how best to do this having regard to the recommendations set out in the Strategy Group Report. The main recommendations of the Strategy Group Report focus on the provision of up-to-date teaching and learning in sufficient quantity in all schools, access to an appropriately specified, cost-efficient broadband service to all learning areas within the school, and a functional and dependable ICT infrastructure with access to appropriate technical support and maintenance to sustain this quality of service.This Joint Advisory Group, which commenced its work in March this year, signifies a strong partnership between industry and the education sector, with the shared objective of supporting children's development potential by enhancing the role of ICT in the education system.The Group's report is being finalised at the moment and I will be considering the recommendations made by the Group in the context of existing policy and available funding.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The renewed Programme for Government commits the Government to no further  increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the  lifetime of this Government. It also states that we will provide 500 teaching  posts between primary and second levels over the next three years.While the precise costs of the additional teaching posts cannot be determined  until the actual appointments are made it is anticipated that every teacher  appointed will give rise to an initial annual pay cost of approx. €46,000 on  appointment rising to an average of €64,000 over time. Accordingly assuming 200 extra teachers from the beginning of the next year and a further 150 teachers next September the extra pay costs next year will be in the order of €11  million and the ongoing full year pay cost when all 500 teachers are employed  at average salary will be in the order of €32 million.As the Deputy is aware the Revised Programme for Government is for delivery  over the period to 2012.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I am aware of the world university rankings that were widely published in the media last week and I am pleased to note the positive progress of a number of Irish institutions on the basis of the measures involved.  The institutions concerned are to be commended on their achievements.While any single ranking system needs to be carefully interpreted and the use  of ranking systems of this nature can be a source of contention, it is the case  that international rankings can be an important influence of institutional  reputation in developing international collaborations and attracting overseas  students and staff.  It is important however to bear in mind that different  ranking systems use different performance metrics to gauge what are often quite  qualitative outcomes with quantitative data.   Outcome evaluation and  performance metrics for both institutions and higher education systems is an  evolving field.  The European Commission is currently looking into the  feasibility of a developing a new European ranking system for universities.  This initiative builds on earlier EU-funded work on mapping the different  strengths and missions of universities. The first results of the envisaged  pilot project will be available in the first half of 2011.  I also await with  interest the findings of the current OECD Feasibility Study for the  International Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcomes (AHELO) which is due to report next year.  This study is addressing concerns that too narrow a range of measures may overly influence or distort institutional behaviour or government policy when taken in the context of the wider remit held by higher education systems.Our higher education institutions play a central valuable role in culture, society and the economy and must serve a whole range of regional and national  needs as well as enhancing Ireland's international profile in terms of attracting talent and overseas students.   We expect the system to pursue excellence in all of these ambitions and furthermore to respond to the needs of a wide range of students and to drive an agenda of equality of opportunity for all.  It would not be feasible in this context to expect one measurement or ranking system to be able to fully compare what are extremely complex institutions with diverse missions and roles.As Minister for Education and Science, my primary concern is to ensure that  these multiple roles, which are all extremely important, receive appropriate  attention.  As the Deputy will be aware I have established a high level  Strategy Group to consider the sector in its entirety and to develop a vision  for its future direction taking all of these considerations into account.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	252	The school to which the Deputy refers is recognised by my Department. In common  with all schools, when initially established, the school was granted temporary  recognition to allow it to demonstrate its viability.With regard to the criteria for permanent recognition, my Department is guided  by a Commission on School Accommodation (CSA) Report produced in 2004 on the "Criteria and Procedures for establishing and maintaining provision through the medium of Irish in second level schools". The report recommends that for an  Irish Medium school to be recognised, it must have:An initial first year projected enrolment of 30 pupils;A projected average first year enrolment of 40 pupils over six years;A projected total enrolment of 250-300, six years after opening;Suitable accommodation; andCompliance with Section 10 of the Education Act, 1998The school to which the Deputy refers had an enrolment of 105 pupils for the  2008/2009 school year, which falls short of that needed for permanent  recognition. In the circumstances, earlier this year, the Department extended  the school's temporary recognition for a further three years to allow it the  opportunity to develop further.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	253	81.2% of second level pupils study three languages, Irish, English and a continental language, to completion of upper second level, and over 70% of schools offer two foreign languages or more. The languages available as part of the post primary curriculum in schools include French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic. The post primary language initiative provides supports to encourage a diversification of language provision in schools and to encourage the take up of languages other than French.It is important that students experience a broad and balanced education which  prepares them for economic and social participation, for democratic citizenship  and lifelong learning. Of necessity this requires that students have to juggle  priorities in making decisions on subject choice. Curricular choice is important in ensuring that young people are offered a balanced range of subjects in keeping with their interests and abilities, and that they are motivated to achieve success in learning and remain in school to completion of upper second level education.The study shows that English is the most widely studied language in upper  second level education across the EU other than their mother tongue. The fact  that all Irish people speak English, often referred to as the new lingua franca, can be a disincentive to the learning of other languages, just as in other European Member States it is often difficult to promote the learning of languages other than English.The 2005 Report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs "Languages and  Enterprise – The Demand and Supply of Foreign Language Skills in the Enterprise Sector" shows little evidence of unsatisfied demand for workers in Ireland with language skills.  It highlights that 80% of the demand for languages in the Foreign Direct Investment Sector in Ireland is for native speakers, and  this rises to 90% in some sectors. This need is met predominantly through  recruiting native speakers from the diverse population now living in Ireland,  and the report does not envisage that needs at this level would be met by Irish  workers.  However, a key area for development and expansion which could be met by Irish workers is in relation to back office supports where a lower level of  fluency in a language allied with a higher end professional or technical qualification is required.The Report suggested that while Irish firms do not appear to place a high value  on language skills, they may be losing export opportunities due to a lack of  languages and cultural awareness, and that there is considerable untapped  latent demand in this area. It recommends that the Modern Languages Initiatives  in primary and post primary schools should be expanded and mainstreamed.   However, my Department is not in a position to progress this at present, and  the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has recommended against the introduction of a modern language at primary level at this time due to issues  relating to  curriculum overload and the replicability of the current model.The fact that over 80% of students study a modern language, in addition to  Irish and English, to completion of upper second level education provides a  firm foundation for further developments in this area within further and higher  education and training.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 156 and 559 together.The Deputies will be aware that following publication of the Ryan Report, this  House passed a unanimous motion on 28th May, 2009 calling on the congregations to commit to making further substantial contributions by way of reparation, in the context of discussions with the State, including to a Trust to be set up and managed by the State for the support of victims and to other education and welfare purposes.The Taoiseach and relevant Ministers, including myself, met representatives of  the religious congregations on 4th and 24th June last.  At the meeting on 4th  June, the Taoiseach conveyed the views of the Government and this House, that  further substantial contributions are required by way of reparation and that  these contributions need to be capable of being assessed by the public for their significance by reference to the full resources available to the congregations and in the context of the costs of well over a billion euro incurred by the State.  At the meeting and subsequently in a press release, the congregations indicated their willingness to make further contributions.  Any such contributions will be separate to those associated with the 2002  Indemnity Agreement. The current engagement with the religious congregations  does not involve a re-negotiation of that agreement.At the subsequent meeting on 24th June, the congregations reported on the  progress they had made in compiling reports on their financial positions. The  Taoiseach indicated that the Government would appoint a panel of three  independent persons to assess the material submitted by the congregations and  report to Government as to the adequacy of these statements as a basis for  assessing the resources of the congregations.The appointment of the three person panel by the Government to examine these statements was announced on 28th July.  In this announcement, the Government indicated that while the Panel is carrying out its work, it expected that the congregations would be working to produce an offer of a substantial  contribution by way of reparation for the suffering of children in residential  institutions. The statement was circulated to the leaders of all the congregations and their attention was specifically drawn to this aspect of it.All of the congregations have submitted their statements and I understand that  the Panel is well advanced in its work and expects to be in a position to report before the end of October. It is intended that the conclusions of the panel will be made public.The Taoiseach wrote to the congregations in September requesting that the offer be forwarded to me as soon as possible.  The offer from the congregations is awaited.On the question of the uses to which the contribution will be put, the House  has noted that both in the meetings with former residents and the congregations, support was expressed for the proposal that the use of a further substantial contribution from the congregations should include a form of independent trust to be set up by the State which would be available to support the needs of survivors for general education and welfare purposes.  The Government will consider the matter, in consultation with the representatives of the survivors and the congregations, following receipt of the offer from the congregations and the report of the Panel on the adequacy of the financial statements provided by the congregations as a basis for assessing the resources of the congregations.

Implementation of this decision requires, inter alia, amendment of the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Act, 1998 and a new management and funding agreement between the US-Ireland Alliance and my Department.Following protracted negotiations with the US-Ireland Alliance, agreement was  reached on a draft new funding and management agreement in March 2009.In July 2009, following Government approval of the general scheme of the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund (Amendment) Bill 2009, I sent the Bill to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting. Drafting of the Bill is currently  in progress and the Bill is scheduled to be published in the current session.My Department's funding allocation in respect of the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme will be decided in the context of decisions on the  Estimates for 2010 and subsequent years and the matching funding raised by the  US-Ireland Alliance.

This review is intended to ensure a consistent application of the criteria in all schools. The SENOs convey the outcome of the reviews directly to schools.The Deputy will also be aware that my Department is separately carrying out a  Value for Money and Policy Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme. This  is a comprehensive review of the rationale for the scheme, including the role  of the SNA and will provide a basis on which more informed policy decisions can  be made in relation to the scheme. It is expected that this review will be completed by the end of 2009. A final report will be laid before the Houses of  the Oireachtas.

The detailed functional specification for the Inventory has been completed and  work is currently underway on building the online interface and database to  hold the information.The online facility will enable schools to provide information about their  accommodation, including its composition in terms of permanent and temporary  structures, electronically to the Department.    The Department will also be  collecting information on the age of existing school accommodation including  both purchased and rented prefabs.    The inventory will also include information on size of school sites.Schools will be able to access the online facility through the Department's Esinet portal.  Initially it is planned that a small number of schools will be given access to the facility for testing.   This is scheduled to take place in November.   It is expected that the facility will be made available to all schools to start uploading information before the end of 2009.When all the information has been received from schools, the Inventory will  provide key data and statistics on the existing school building stock throughout the country at both primary and post-primary levels.  It will enable the Department to more accurately calculate capacity in existing school accommodation and therefore identify where additional accommodation is required.When the information has been compiled and analysed, it is intended to publish  it and this is likely to happen before the end of the current school year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	259	As the number of births in this country continues to rise, my Department is faced with the challenge of providing accommodation to cater for a ten percent  increase in school-aged children, and to establish where, throughout the  country, this accommodation will be required.  In 2000 there were 54,789 births  in Ireland, while the 2008 figure is 75,065, a 37% increase over the period.   The 2008 figure is the highest number recorded since 1896 and means that the  total enrolments in primary schools may grow from 498,914 pupils in the 2008/09  year to in excess of 590,000 by year 2020.While these figures indicate the situation at the national level, the challenge  is to establish in which locations the school going cohort will increase most  significantly, so that sufficient school accommodation can be put in place to  meet demand.  To this end the Department is utilising a Geographical  Information System (GIS). The Department's GIS utilises data from the Central  Statistics Office, Ordinance Survey Ireland, the General Registers Office and  the Department of Social Welfare and Family Affairs, in addition to data from  local authorities.GIS allows the Department to conduct detailed analysis on the demographics of  each part of the country, and enables the Department to model a range of forecast scenarios for each area for the coming years and assess the likely  changes to the school going population in those areas.The accommodation needs of each area will be considered in this context and  addressed under the school building and modernisation programme consistent with the priority attaching to individual projects and the availability of funding.

In these difficult  times, we have to work together to ensure that the resources available to us  are used to ensure the best possible outcomes for our learners.  I hope that  the association will reflect on these concerns, and will reconsider its stance  in relation to parent teacher meetings in the public interest.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 589 together.For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their  circumstances either as students dependent on parents or guardians, dependent  mature students or as independent mature students. An independent mature  student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his  or her parents from the October preceding entry to an approved course.When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that parental income must be taken into account.  Independent mature students, on the other hand, are assessed without reference  to their parents' income. The reckonable income of an independent mature  student is that of the candidate only and of his or her spouse where appropriate.In order to establish a candidate's status as an independent mature student,  documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate's address from 1st  October of the year preceding entry to college.  In considering whether a  mature student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her  parents, awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt  that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period  has been submitted by the grant applicant.The documentary evidence normally required by a local authority or VEC to  establish independent residence includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas  or ESB bill, evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies  Board or official documentation received at the address, for example, from a  Government Department. In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible  to produce such proofs of residence in the relevant period for demonstrable  reasons, the awarding authority may, at its discretion, agree to accept other  documentary proofs.My Department has reviewed the requirements for establishing independent  residency and is satisfied that the current practice in this regard is both  reasonable and appropriate.

These services may include on-campus medical and counselling facilities for students, access and disability services, careers office, student facilities, student clubs and societies etc. Currently, the student services charge is decided annually by third-level institutions in consultation with the Higher Education Authority and my Department.   I do not propose to change this arrangement.  Any change in the level of this charge would only be considered where the increase is intended to bring the amount contributed by students into line with the costs of the range of students services provided.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments to the Student Support Bill in relation to legal and policy issues which have arisen since Second Stage are being advanced by my Department in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.The Bill makes provision for the transfer of responsibility for student grants  to the VEC sector. In the existing budgetary situation, resources are not  currently available to advance transition to new administrative arrangements in  the immediate future. However, it is not possible to say definitively at this  point when new administrative arrangements can be put in place and I am  anxious, in light of the commitment to put all student grants on a statutory  footing, to provide a statutory basis for all student grants for the intervening period.Therefore, I am endeavouring to progress to a single scheme of grants as  provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date, while further exploring  the options for administrative streamlining in the context of budgetary  considerations and the Government's overall programme of public service reform, Transforming Public Services.This will require further amendments to the Bill and my Department has been  working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in that regard. Subject  to any technical, drafting and legal considerations arising, I hope to be in a  position to have these amendments advanced sufficiently in order to progress to  Committee Stage in the autumn session.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	267	The OECD PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) 2006 survey of 15 years olds across 57 countries showed that Ireland's mean score in mathematics was not significantly different from the OECD average. We ranked 16th of 30 OECD countries and 22nd of 57 countries. There were fewer lower achievers and higher achievers than the OECD average, with the majority of pupils scoring in the mid range of achievement. When performance levels for mathematics in 2006 are compared with those in 2000 and 2003, there are no changes for Irish students. Ireland showed a high level of equity in achievement outcomes. This is evidenced by relatively small levels of "between school" variation and comparatively good standards among lower achievers.The Report of the Expert Group calls for the introduction of bonus points for  Higher Level Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate.  Decisions on the award of  points and admission criteria for entry to higher education programmes are,  under legislation, a matter for the higher education institutions. My Department asked the Higher Education Authority to initiate a discussion across higher education institutions regarding the desirability or otherwise of awarding bonus points. The overall view emerging was that the introduction of bonus points was unlikely to dramatically increase uptake of Higher Level Maths. The Report of the Points Commission in 1999 considered the issue of bonus points and recommended against such an approach. Providing bonus points could reinforce the perception that Maths is a difficult subject. It should be noted that when bonus points were removed in 1994 on foot of curricular reform, participation in Higher Level Maths increased.My Department is addressing the issues highlighted in the Report through the  Project Maths initiative, which began in 24 second level schools at both junior and senior cycle in 2008. Implementation is beginning in all schools in 2010.  Starting in the Project schools allows the opportunity to trial the changes and to develop lesson plans and exemplars for teachers at the same time.The Project Maths initiative is designed to encourage better understanding of  Maths, to reinforce the practical relevance of maths to everyday life, and to ensure better continuity between primary and second level, and junior and senior cycle. The curriculum changes are being phased in over three years focusing on different aspects of mathematics.  Phase 3 will have begun in all schools in 2012, and will be fully implemented in all class groups by 2015.Project Maths is being supported by intensive investment in professional development for teachers. Some €3m has been provided for the programme in 2009, and a rolling programme of investment will continue in this area to at least  2013.  Nationwide professional development for all mathematics  teachers has  started this month, preparatory to beginning implementation in all schools from  2010.

However, in light of the changed economic circumstances that have given rise to the commitment contained in the new Programme for Government, I will not now be proceeding on this basis.While it is agreed that a new form of student contribution should not be introduced in the current economic circumstances, the longer term question of  future funding arrangements for the sector is clearly relevant to the work of  the Higher Education Strategy Group in framing a vision and strategy for higher  education over the next twenty years.  Accordingly, I now propose to refer the  technical report to the Strategy Group as an input to its broader deliberations  on how any additional resource requirements for delivering on a new vision and  related set of policy objectives for the sector can be met over the timeframe  of the new strategy. I intend to publish the technical report in the near future.

The formats currently catered for are: Braille, tactile diagrams, Large Print and text-only files on computer disk. The NBPC is funded by the Department of Education and Science and in 2009 a grant of €1,150,000 was allocated to the centre.The NBPC's current policy is to make one print copy of brailled books available  in hard copy format to the client and provide an alternative electronic copy  that schools/parents can arrange to braille. In exceptional circumstances, the  NBPC will provide a second copy of the braille books.I can assure the Deputy that funding for special educational needs remains a  key priority within my Department.

In advance of such discussions it has written to the  education partners to seek any observations or suggestions they may have in  relation to the implementation of the commitment. This will assist my  Department in identifying issues for discussion and to set a detailed agenda  for the discussions.In that regard the views of the education partners have been sought on:The division of posts between the primary and post-primary sectorsThe best way to identify those schools that are "most seriously affected by  the recent increase in the PTR" and the criteria that might be applied in such  identification?The desirability of implementing the commitment in a manner through an  allocation process that keeps the administrative burden at a minimum for both  schools and the Department.The education partners have been given until Thursday 29 October 2009 to  forward their views to my Department.  It would be inappropriate for me to  comment further on the issues raised by the Deputy pending the outcome of the  consultation process.

Staff claim travel and overnight expenses in accordance with the rules and rates appropriate to the relevant destination. Accommodation and flights are booked by NESDO on behalf of staff travelling abroad on official business. NESDO uses a centralised flight booking service with a single point of access within NESDO.  NESDO places emphasis on obtaining value for money and the vast majority of flights booked are economy  class.   The prior approval of the Chief Officer for all travel and associated expenses, both domestic and foreign, must be obtained before any travel is undertaken.Expenditure on official entertainment is kept to an absolute minimum and is in accordance with the guidelines set by Department of Finance.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 200 together.Enterprise Ireland has primary responsibility for Irish companies in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors. It supports companies employing 10 or more people and start-up companies which have the potential to employ 10 or more people and reach or exceed €1m in exports over three years. Enterprise Ireland offers a comprehensive range of services, including both financial and non-financial supports, to companies with a business strategy that encompasses the elements required for business success.At present, the games industry in Ireland has significant potential and there is a solid presence here with the majority of companies having been established within the past eight years.Enterprise Ireland is actively involved in the Games and related Entertainment and Technology sectors.  During the past four years, Enterprise Ireland has invested €2m in games companies. Employment in the gaming companies currently stands at 500, and is worth circa €10m-€15m to the Irish economy.The Irish Games sector has attracted a lot of acquisition interests from major overseas players.  Over the last 36 months a number of Enterprise Ireland companies have been acquired Havoc (Intel), Demonware (Activision) and Upstart (Sun 3C).In addition, a number of multi-national gaming companies have a presence in Ireland also, such as Vivendi Universal Games, PopCap Games and Microsoft Games. GOA, part of France Telecom, which deals with games distribution and publishing, employs around 250 staff here.  Gala, a Japanese company, has established its European base in Ireland producing and rolling out games; and US casual games pioneer PopCap International, also has its European Headquarters here.A new emerging trend is online gaming, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), casual games and funware gaming. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with start-ups in these areas. This area has an estimated worth of €33bn worldwide and is constantly growing.Enterprise Ireland continues to support the games sector in Ireland and actively engages with the companies in regard to clustering and sectoral development.

We are especially conscious of the necessity to secure new and emerging markets, including the fast growing Asian economies.  In particular, trade with China has developed rapidly in recent years, as a result of the Government's Asia Strategy.  Any potential trade benefits for Ireland, which could flow from our involvement in Expo 2010 in Shanghai, will, of course, be pursued. My Department has no responsibility for the arrangements relating to Ireland’s pavilion at Expo 2010. 
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	283	In reply to a previous question put down by the Deputy on 8 October about the company, an indication was given that notice of a collective redundancy had not been received in the Department.  Following a further search through the unprecedented large number of claims on hand, it is now clear that this information was incorrect.   In fact, notice of a collective redundancy was submitted by the Company and received in my Department but was misfiled in the system for categorising claims.  I apologise sincerely for the incorrect information given to the Deputy in this regard, which was due to an administrative error.Given that the company did file the notice as required under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977,  I can now confirm that no issue arises in relation to a breach of that Act.As regards the Labour Relations Commission, I understand that conciliation talks between the company and the union were held, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, on Friday last 16 October 2009.  Arising from these talks, I understand that the workers decided not to proceed with proposed strike action and are currently considering their position.  The services of the LRC and the Labour Court remain available to the parties, if required.In relation to the Labour Court decision in 2007 to which the Deputy refers, my understanding is that this related to a restructuring arrangement at the company at that time and that, in that context, the company did in fact comply with the Labour Court decision.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	284	My reply to the Deputy on 7 October '09 set out the status in relation to the outstanding redundancy rebate claims for the company in question.  The delay in processing the claims arises due to the unprecedented levels of redundancy claims which await processing in my Department.Redundancy Payments are paid out of the Social Insurance Fund which is funded from contributions by Employers and Employees in active employment.  Monies from the Fund go to meet social insurance payments but the Fund does not make interest payments.Arising from concerns expressed to both the Tánaiste and myself by businesses experiencing particular difficulties in meeting tax payment obligations because of a delay in receiving rebate repayments from the Redundancy Payments Section of the Department, we have agreed an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate such situations.  This allows employers to have the redundancy rebate payments owing to them offset against the same amount of outstanding tax liability.In order for a company to arrange for payment of an outstanding tax liability to Revenue via their redundancy rebate payment they must request and agree this arrangement in writing with Revenue, authorizing my Department to make the company's redundancy rebate payable to Revenue. When agreement with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is in place, Revenue contact my Department referring to the company's request, attaching a copy of such request, and instructing my Department to forward the payment directly to Revenue.On receipt of this correspondence from Revenue, my Department follows up with the Revenue official dealing with the case informing him/her of the approximate value of claims on hand for that Company so that appropriate action can be taken in relation to the tax liability.This arrangement is proving to be extremely useful to businesses and is being availed of in a number of situations.

At the time, it was genuinely felt locally that while there was a downturn in demand for its products, the Drogheda site could potentially win more added value activity which would increase its capacity to survive the current crisis.   IDA is continuing to negotiate with management at the company on possible initiatives to avert the closure of the Drogheda facility.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I understand this question to refer to the role of the Registrar of Friendly societies in relation to trade union regulation and governance.  The Registrar of Friendly Societies has a range of functions relating to friendly societies, industrial and provident societies and trade unions, dating back to the late nineteenth century.   The relevant legislation concerning trade unions is set down in the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1990.  Under that legislation trade unions may register with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, subject to a range of obligations in relation to such registration.  Principally, these include the following obligations:to register their rules and the titles and names of officers,to submit an annual return to the Registrar before the first day of June each year, specifying the receipts, funds, effects and expenditure of the trade union (which return to be accompanied by a copy of the audited accounts and a copy of the current rules),to submit annually a copy of all alterations of rules, new rules, and change of officers made during the previous year, andto maintain a registered office and to notify the Registrar of any change in the registered office.In addition to maintaining a file on each registered trade union and making it available for inspection, for his part the Registrar mustissue a certificate of registration to trade unionsregister the returns mentioned abovecancel/restore registered trade unions as appropriate, andapprove and register amalgamations and transfer of engagements.The Registrar also has a number of specific powers in the area of investigation/dispute resolution:to investigate complaints of discriminatory treatment against a non-contributor to a political fund.  The Registrar may make an order to remedy the breach, which is binding and conclusive, and not subject to appeal (section 3(2) of the Trade Union Act 1913).to investigate complaints under section 16(5) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 concerning the operation of secret ballots, following which the Registrar may instruct a trade union to comply with the secret ballot provisions of the Act (section 14(2)). Where such instruction is disregarded the Registrar must inform the Minister, who may revoke the union's negotiating licence.to hear disputes referred to the Registrar under section 10 of the Trade Union Act, 1975 concerning the passing of resolutions approving amalgamations of trade unions.  Under this section, the Registrar may, at the request of the complainant or of the trade union, state a case for the opinion of the High Court on a question of law arising in the proceedings.The powers of the Registrar in relation to such matters have rarely been exercised.  The Registrar has no independent powers of investigation, and can only act where requested to do so on the specific areas mentioned above, or to refer a matter to the court in relation to wilful or fraudulent withholding of money.  This latter option is also available to "any person" acting on behalf of a trade union.  The Registrar reports annually to the Minister in respect of the principal matters transacted in the Registry in respect of registered trade unions.  This report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

For example, each year FÁS commissions independent external consultants to conduct a follow-up survey of a representative sample of former trainees who completed their training with FÁS eighteen months previously. The purpose of this study is to monitor the post programme experience of trainees in terms of their view of the training they received, their employment experience subsequent to their training, and the extent to which they have utilised their newly acquired skills.  FÁS also regularly commissions customer satisfaction surveys of both job seekers and employers who have availed of its services.  The results of all published follow-up surveys since the year 2000 are available on the FÁS website.

A further 1,116 apprentices are registered with FÁS and are not currently pursuing their apprenticeship.  My Department through the auspices of FÁS has responded to the increased level of redundant apprentices, especially in construction and related sectors, by putting in place a number of measures to assist redundant apprentices who wish to complete their apprenticeship.In addition to the immediate referral to FÁS of redundant apprentices through the social welfare system and the provision of appropriate guidance by FÁS in relation to preparation for a re-sit of any outstanding off-the-job modular assessments, the rules for off-the-job training have been amended by FÁS to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training at phases 2, 4 and 6. The number of redundant apprentices who can be expected to be scheduled for off-the-job training in 2009 is 2400.Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses, which are trade-related to enhance their employable skills, and trade-related night courses available in FÁS Training Centres. FÁS will provide redundant apprentices with an opportunity to undertake phase 7 assessments where an on-the-job assessment opportunity is not currently available. FÁS will also be providing a facility for redundant apprentices who have reached the minimum qualifying standard in all phases 1-7 inclusive and who have not completed the minimum duration in employment as an apprentice to make an application for consideration under Recognition of Prior Learning for the Award of an Advanced Craft Certificate.My Department has introduced a temporary Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme to facilitate and support employers to provide on-the-job training in trades such as Brick & Stone-laying, Carpentry & Joinery, Plastering, Plumbing, Cabinet Making, Painting & Decorating, Wood Machining and Electrical. This scheme assists an employer to take on a redundant apprentice when their own apprentice has been released to go on scheduled phase 4 or phase 6 off-the-job training in an Institute of Technology. It is expected that over 400 apprentices will be provided with on-the-job training with assessments during 2009.In addition, a number of other organisations have assisted in providing measures aimed at assisting redundant workers. For example, Léargas is providing funding under the EU Leonardo Da Vinci vocational education and training programme to support the placement of almost 100 redundant apprentices with overseas employers to complete their phase 7 on-the-job training with assessments.  ESB Networks has agreed a programme with FÁS to provide on-the-job training to eligible redundant electrical and motor apprentices at phase 5 and phase 7. This programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of eighteen months and will be funded by ESB Networks. There are currently 125 previously redundant  apprentices in employment with ESB Networks, 25 redundant electrical apprentices have completed their off-the-job training with assessments and a further 100 redundant apprentices will be provided with an opportunity to complete their on-the-job training before the end of December 2009.In the higher education sector the Institutes of Technology are providing an 11-week certified training programme for those redundant apprentices in the construction, electrical and engineering areas who have completed their phase 4 training but where an on- or off-the-job training opportunity is not currently available to them. This programme commenced in September 2009.  FÁS will continue to work with the stakeholders in apprenticeship to explore initiatives to assist redundant apprentices to complete their apprenticeship.

In the second quarter of 2009, the most recent quarter for which data is available, there was an annual decrease in employment of 174,300 or 8.2% while unemployment increased by 137,900 over the same period.  Employment data in respect of companies supported by the Enterprise Agencies (Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development) is collated by Forfás on an annual basis only, and accordingly monthly or weekly figures cannot be supplied. In 2008 a total of 20,014 full-time jobs were created in companies supported by the Enterprise Agencies, while 28,885 full-time jobs were lost in the same year – a net loss for 2008 of 8,871.There is no exact measure of the number of jobs lost, however, the Department records the number of redundancies notified to them on a monthly basis. The table sets out the number of redundancy notifications received in 2008 and to end September, 2009, the most recent date for which figures are available.  The Employment Subsidy Scheme (Temporary) applies to vulnerable but viable companies in the manufacturing or internationally traded service sectors.   It will involve the payment of a subsidy to firms to retain an agreed level of jobs.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	293	FÁS Services to Business supports skills development in small businesses through the Excellence Through People standard which has been running for several years.  FÁS Employment Services recently announced the Work Placement Programme which is designed to offer unemployed people, including unemployed graduates, the opportunity to obtain 6 months quality experience in a work situation.  The benefit to employers is that they will, by giving someone the opportunity to gain work experience in their field, ensure the future supply of qualified and experienced people for their business or sector.   Additionally, should a position become available within the business, they would have a prospective applicant with relevant work experience.The Skillnets Training Network Programme is an enterprise-led programme providing training, upskilling and networking supports to persons in employment with a particular emphasis on the low basic skilled and on SMEs. In 2008 the Training Network Programme facilitated over 56,000 trainees in over 20,000 enterprises. It currently operates nationally across 103 separate sectoral and regional networks.  In 2009 the Finuas Training Network Programme was launched to provide similar supports in the international financial services sector.County and City Enterprise Boards provide a source of support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants.  All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects, which should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.  CEBs also deliver a range of non-financial supports, such as business advice and information services, management development programmes and mentoring initiatives, which are designed to help new and existing micro-enterprises operate more effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.The Employment Subsidy Scheme (Temporary) which is being managed by Enterprise Ireland, applies to vulnerable but viable companies in the manufacturing or internationally traded service sectors.  It will involve the payment of a subsidy to firms to retain an agreed level of jobs. The principal aim of the Scheme is to maximise full-time employment in the first place by securing a multiple of jobs being subsidised.  A further initiative both my colleague Minister Hanafin and I launched on the 27th May is the Short Time Working Training Programme. This new initiative offers individuals the opportunity to receive training that suits their specific requirements. With individuals who are on short time working, this Programme will provide two days training a week for 277 workers over a 52-week period.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Ensuring value for money in terms of government investment is always important but it is particularly critical in times of economic challenge.  It has long been established that value for money is achieved through focusing state assistance on exporting companies rather than on those selling to the domestic market.  The provision of assistance to indigenous companies that are not export-oriented generates significant levels of displacement, deadweight and market distortion.  Ireland's economic success is intrinsically linked to Irish industry achieving sales in international markets.  I therefore have no plans to expand the remit of Enterprise Ireland to incorporate indigenous companies that are not export-orientated.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	297	In conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan, T.D., I established the Credit Supply Clearing Group in May of this year with the following terms of reference:To identify specific patterns of events or groups of cases, by sector, geographically, or otherwise, where the flow of credit to viable business appears to be blocked.To aggregate the details of individual cases brought to the Clearing Group's attention in order to identify patterns.To seek to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.On an exceptional basis, to consider significant, individual viable cases where the flow of credit appears to be blocked and which either appear to illustrate a trend or are economically significant in their own right.To provide a mechanism for lenders to address how their stated credit policies match the current realities of business lending.To develop an overall view of business credit problems.To report to Government on a regular basis the issues addressed by the clearing group and any solutions found.The Credit Supply Clearing Group is chaired by my Department and includes representatives of the banking and business sectors along with Departmental representatives and representatives of the primary support agencies.  Three meetings have taken place to date with a fourth one scheduled for later this month.  To assist and complement the work of the Credit Supply Clearing Group, Billy Kelleher, T.D., the Minister for Trade and Commerce at my Department held eight regional meetings over a two-week period during June and July to discuss with representatives of business, banks and the State sector, their experience of gaining access to bank credit at local and regional level.As part of the ongoing work of the Government's Credit Supply Clearing Group, my Department launched an email link on 28 August last calling for submissions from viable businesses that have been refused credit by banks. Such businesses, where the flow of credit appears to be blocked, can now send their details to a dedicated email contact point at the Department, creditsupplyclearinggroup@entemp.ie .  To date seven submissions have been received via this dedicated email contact point. In addition, a small number of cases have also been referred to individual banks for follow-up action, following approaches made by business interests represented on the Group.  To date, no specific patterns of events or groups of cases, by sector, geographically, or otherwise have become evident where the flow of credit to viable business appears to be blocked. The Credit Supply Clearing Group is providing an opportunity for the business community to engage with financial institutions and provides a mechanism for lenders to address how their stated credit policies match realities on the ground in their branches nationwide.
Following the publication last July of the Independent Review of Bank Lending To SMEs (The Mazars Report), members of the Credit Supply Clearing Group have contributed to the follow up work in relation to the future monitoring of bank lending to SMEs and have given views in relation to other recommendations made in the Mazars Report.  This has facilitated the Department of Finance in the carrying out a further Independent Review of bank lending which is currently underway.  Final results from this Review are expected next month.The work of the Credit Supply Clearing Group, together with the outcomes of the Independent Review of Bank Lending to SMEs, has greatly assisted in the development of an overall view of business credit problems.  The ongoing availability of credit to business is a critical issue for our small and medium sized enterprises as they trade through the current economic downturn and work to protect jobs in our economy. The actions already taken by this Government to stabilise the banking sector and to ensure that the banks meet their commitments under the recapitalisation package are all focused on getting banks once again to support our broader enterprise economy by extending appropriate credit to viable projects.  The Credit Supply Clearing Group will continue to play a key role in this process by addressing the legitimate concerns of both businesses and the lending banks.

This is 4.4% of current serving staff numbers of 1093.  To date my Department has received 45 applications under the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement. Due to the small number of applications at the higher level I am not prepared to give a breakdown of grades, as it may be possible to identify individual officers or at least cause unhelpful speculation as to the identity of applicants before applicants themselves are ready to announce their retirement.The Deputy should note that in addition, my Department continues to experience retirements on age grounds (60-65), ill health and on a Cost Neutral basis. Given the current moratorium on the filling of such vacancies, it is not possible to anticipate the number of officials at Principal Officer level and above who are expected to be working in my Department following the full implementation of the Incentivised Early Retirement Scheme.

However, Shannon Development informs me that three new jobs were created in the Information Age Park in Ennis between January and August 2009.  Nine jobs were lost at this business park by August 2009, with six of these transferring to other business parks.  The number of jobs excluding those transferred from the existing business centre in Ennis, created at the business park since 2005 is 64. Clare County Council also occupied a number of suites in Block A and B from 1 May 2005 to 31 January 2008 with 150 staff approximately.

The Bill provides for, inter alia, the use of US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) in the preparation of the accounts of a specified category of companies for a limited period of time.  Approval was given by Government for the drafting of this Bill on 13th October, 2009.  The text of the Bill is subject to Government approval and will be considered by them in due course.

The EU then agrees the final digits that it adds to allow for more specific identification.  Under the existing international system, it is not possible to distinguish between goods that are wholly made in one country and those that are transformed in the tariff codes.  The question of whether or not substantial transformation has taken place is dealt with under rules of origin, and these rules are determined at EU level. Once a good has met the requirements for substantial transformation, it qualifies as a good originating in the country where that substantial transformation has taken place, and is treated in the same way as a good that is wholly made in the same country for the purposes of applying or suspending tariffs.

This provision allows the Court to investigate a trade dispute where the Labour Relations Commission is satisfied that it is unable to further assist the parties and the parties themselves have requested the involvement of the Court. However, the Labour Court's recommendation is not binding on either party to the dispute and the Court cannot compel a company to comply with its recommendations.Ireland's system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.  Responsibility for the settlement of this dispute rests, ultimately, with the parties themselves.  The obligation lies with the parties to seek to resolve their differences and to carry their efforts through to completion.  As the Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, namely the Labour Court recommendation.I welcome the decision taken by UNITE members to call off the strike action scheduled for 30 September at the Bank of Ireland in order to seek clarification from the Labour Court on its recent recommendation.  I understand that the Labour Court has issued its clarification.  In my view, the experience and expertise of the Court continue to provide the best avenue for resolving the issues in dispute. To this end, I would urge the company to reflect carefully on the consequences of not complying with the Court's recommendation and would strongly encourage them to give positive consideration to the recommendation.

However, Section 17 of the revised Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, published in May 2009, states that non-commercial State Bodies should adopt and comply in all respects with the circulars issued from time to time by the Department of Finance regarding travel and subsistence.  The Code also states that Boards of State bodies that incur significant annual expenditure on foreign travel by members of the staff or the Board should put appropriate procedures in place to monitor, report, and enforce the relevant rules and requirements.  The Code includes, at Appendix VI, a Framework for a Travel Policy.The Code of Practice also includes a suggested Framework for a Code of Business Conduct for all directors and employees of State bodies.  The Framework advocates that the Code of Business Conduct should address fundamental issues of principle, including the preparation of an explanatory booklet providing practical guidance and direction on such areas as gifts and entertainment.  My Department has brought the Code of Practice to the attention of the Department's agencies.  The main Department of Finance circulars and letters governing domestic and foreign travel arrangements have also been brought to the attention of the agencies by my officials.   It is my intention that compliance by the agencies with these guidelines will be monitored by my Department as part of the annual reporting procedures prescribed in the Code of Practice.

I understand that during protracted negotiations a number of issues were raised by Mr. Kearns including the size of the site to be included in the sale, a mapping error, the start and completion dates of a proposed expansion to the factory on that site and VAT.  These issues were finally resolved and the sale was completed, as I have said, in December of last year.  As far as the IDA is aware, there are no other outstanding issues.  Mr. Kearns had already bought two other plots of land on the same site from the IDA in 1998 and 1999 and I understand that he is currently in negotiation with the Agency regarding the purchase of the freehold interest in all three plots.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	308	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF – rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department received a statutory lump sum claim from the individual concerned on 11 September 2009.  When an employer claims inability to pay, the onus is on the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. In this case, further information has been requested from the employer to allow a decision to be reached and the claim to be processed. If the former employer does not forward the required information it may be necessary for the employee to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal against the employer.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements and where all of the required supporting documentation has been submitted, the Section is, in general, processing lump sum claims dating from June '09.Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first nine months of 2009 at 60,785 an increase of 122% on the same period last year (27,373). This figure of 60,785 exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.Efforts continue to be made by the Tánaiste and I to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 53.8;the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.

However, Enterprise Ireland inform me that they can support the establishment of a business to make wind turbines subject to the normal commercial requirements of Enterprise Ireland grant aid, in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Development Acts, 1986-2009.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to offer a wide range of services, including financial and non-financial supports to companies with a business strategy that encompasses all elements required for business success. However, if the question relates to the establishment of wind farms, Enterprise Ireland is not in a situation to support such a development.

Subject to final approval from the European Council and European Parliament of the Irish application, some of the redundant workers included for assistance in that EGF application are from the Shannon area and will benefit directly from any supports ultimately provided.My Department is examining all collective redundancies to see whether they may be potentially eligible for EGF assistance subject to meeting the strict eligibility criteria which apply under the EU Regulation governing the Fund.  The various job losses in the Shannon region to date are not adjudged to meet the relevant EGF criteria at this time. However, my Department will continue to monitor and review this situation, as it does with all collective redundancies nationally.

An interim report by Dublin City Council's consultants, presented at that meeting, concluded that a full study of the River Wad Catchment was needed.  Dublin City Council has initiated the procurement process to select a consultant to carry out this study, and that appointment is expected before the end of this year.  The study is to be completed in the first six months of 2010.The Office of Public Works (OPW) does not have responsibilities in the area of insurance cover for families.  The appropriate regulatory body for the industry is the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  The question of humanitarian assistance for families affected by flooding has, since 2005, been a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs, through the local Community Welfare Officer.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that section 784C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 relates to Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs) which form part of the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) options introduced by Finance Act 1999. ARFs and ARMFs are not pension schemes per se but rather investment funds into which the proceeds of certain pension arrangements can be invested on retirement.  At present, the ARF option is primarily available to personal pension holders (i.e. mainly the self-employed with Retirement Annuity Contracts or PRSAs), employees who have made AVC contributions (in respect of those contributions) and proprietary directors (i.e. 5% directors) who are members of occupational pension schemes.In order to exercise the ARF option an individual must either be over 75 years of age or have, in his or her own right, a guaranteed pension income  for life of a minimum of €12,700 per annum at the point of retirement (this is referred to as specified income in the relevant legislation). In this regard, the pension or pensions must actually be in payment – pensions anticipated at some time in the future cannot be brought into the reckoning. Pensions paid directly to a spouse or pensions/allowances received on behalf of a spouse or dependant may not be included. Where the minimum specified income test is not met, the legislation requires that the first €63,500 of the pension fund (after taking the tax free lump sum), or the entire of the remaining fund, if it is less than this, must either be used to purchase an annuity for the individual or invested in an AMRF. The individual can also satisfy this requirement by using part of the €63,500 to purchase an annuity and by placing the rest in an AMRF.The purpose of the AMRF is essentially prudential with a view to preserving at least some of the pension assets over the longer term for the individual to guard against the possibility that the ARF would be depleted earlier than expected. To that end, the capital sum invested in an AMRF is "locked away" and is not available to the individual until he or she attains the age of 75, although any income or gains generated by the fund can be drawn down subject to income tax. However, an individual may use the AMRF funds at any time to purchase an annuity. When an individual attains the age of 75 the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF.Section 784C(4)(a) simply states that, where the individual is in receipt of pension income for life of €12,700 at the time the ARF option is exercised, the AMRF requirement does not arise.  The specified income amount of €12,700 (originally £10,000) has been in place since the ARF legislation was enacted in 1999 and is not directly linked to the maximum personal rate of the contributory State pension (for person under 80) – which stood at €5,876 (£4,628) at that time and currently stands at just short of €12,000 annually.

There is no provision under the terms of the Scheme for the action suggested by the Deputy in relation to art collections of covered institutions. Under the terms of the Scheme, covered institutions pay a quarterly charge to the Exchequer in respect of the guarantee provided under the Scheme.In the case of Anglo Irish Bank, the bank is being run on an arm's length commercial basis by the Board of Anglo. Consequently, the management of assets of the bank, including the holding or display of art works, is a matter for the Board of the bank. This is in line with the position on such matters for other commercial State companies.

The cost would have been significantly higher in 2010 and 2011.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	324	There are currently no plans to proscribe the use of commissions by financial intermediaries in Ireland.  It is considered that the existing legislative protections in place for the consumer sufficiently empowers the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman to investigate and, if necessary, sanction any misbehaviour in relation to mis-selling of financial products or the provision of financial advice which does not serve the best interests of the customer.The Financial Regulator's July 2006 Minimum Competency Requirements set out minimum standards across all financial service providers which are applicable to individuals who, on a professional basis, as or on behalf of a regulated firm, provide advice to consumers on retail financial products, arrange or offer to arrange retail financial products for consumers or undertake certain specified activities. Retail financial products include shares, bonds and other investment instruments and savings, investment and pension products.The disclosure of sales remuneration in relation to certain life assurance products is required by the Life Assurance (Provision of Information) Regulations 2001. These Regulations cover life assurance products, personal pension plans and life assurance investment and savings products.The sale of investment products is covered by the Regulations which transposed the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) into Irish law.  Under these Regulations firms are required to ensure that there is clear and prior disclosure to its clients detailing the existence, nature and amount of the commission.  The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code, which came into effect in August 2006, is a legally enforceable statutory code which is applicable to all entities which the Financial Regulator regulates.Under the General Principles of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code), all regulated firms are required to:Act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of the customerMake full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer; andSeek to avoid conflicts of interest.In addition, there are provisions in the Code, for the protection of those persons which are classified as ‘consumers' under the code, which set specific requirements with which the regulated entity must comply in areas such as its terms of business, provision of information to the consumer, knowing the consumer and suitability.Regulated entities are required to comply with both the Code and Minimum Competency Requirements as a matter of law and the Financial Regulator will investigate any matter brought to its attention where it appears that these, or any other regulatory requirement, may have been breached by an entity.  Any allegation of mis-selling of financial products is a serious matter and will be treated as such by the relevant authorities and any complaint regarding the conduct of a regulated entity should be brought to the attention of the Regulator for investigation. Where found by the Financial Regulator to have breached its obligations, a regulated entity may be subject to financial or other sanctions.The Deputy may wish to note that where a customer has a complaint regarding his/her treatment which has not been resolved through the internal complaint resolutions systems of a regulated entity, the customer may bring the matter to the attention of the Financial Services Ombudsman for investigation.  I am therefore satisfied that adequate safeguards are in place to regulate the activities to which the Deputy refers.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	325	As I stated during the Finance Bill process, it has been my intention to widen if possible the tax base on which betting duty would be applied.  Bets placed either on-line or over the phone are generally with out-of-State companies so applying betting duty is therefore problematic.  My officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are looking at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area and will continue to do so, on an ongoing basis.In addition, my Department is working closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has initiated a review in order to provide the Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing gambling architecture in the State. The review, amongst other things, will consider:the recommendations contained in the Report Gaming in Ireland,the existing law regulating gaming lotteries and other forms of gambling in the jurisdiction,international developments, in particular the experience of the UK's Gambling Commission,developments in relation to remote gambling (e.g. via the internet and mobile phones).As the Deputy may be aware, due to pressure on the betting sector, I decided to defer the introduction of the increase in the betting duty provided for in Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 pending a review. Accordingly, the Finance Act 2009 contains a provision for continuing the existing betting duty rate of 1% unless and until an order is made bringing the 2% rate into effect, or alternative betting  taxation arrangements are enacted. This decision is based on the premise that the betting sector will engage in constructive discussions about putting in place a fair and workable tax base for the sector.  Such discussions will, inter alia, touch on issues such as on-line/phone betting, which is largely untaxed, and look at proposals that could potentially bring this area into the tax net, if possible, while also protecting Irish employment in the sector.

This estimate relates only to the cost of extending refundable tax credits to all those on the Revenue's tax files.  If a refundable tax credit system were to be introduced, one would have to consider those who are not on the tax files, for example, those who are of employable age but not working, including those on social welfare. If such categories were eligible this would increase the cost significantly.  Apart from the issue of cost, there would be a range of other policy and practical issues arising in introducing such a system.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	327	As outlined in my previous reply to the Deputy, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has primary responsibility for matters relating to the state body mentioned, including its pension schemes.  With regard to pension arrangements, the relevant legislation requires that these be approved by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.The position regarding the pension scheme referred to by the Deputy is that officials from my Department are involved in ongoing consultation with officials in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources about it.  Certain aspects must be clarified in order to ensure that the Scheme is in accordance with public service pension policy and with public expenditure policy.I refer to the specific issue raised by the Deputy as to whether all relevant service will be reckonable from a date in February 2009.  Such details of the scheme are a matter in the first instance for the employer to determine and clarify and I am not in a position to advise on this point.  It is hoped that, with cooperation from all parties involved, the scheme will be in order for the Ministers to approve in the near future.

The number expected to be in my Department following full implementation of the ISER is unlikely to exceed 71.10 (WTE), which represents 12.7% of the likely total number of staff in my Department at the reference date.  It should be noted, however, that the number expected to be on the staff of the Department will be determined by a number of factors including ISERs and normal age retirements of staff.

Based on an estimate of around €230 million of bets having been placed with on-course bookmakers at race meetings over the year to 31 August 2009, it is estimated that applying the 1% betting duty to such bets would have yielded the Exchequer approximately €2.3 million.The on-course duty was reduced to zero in 1999 in the context of the reduction in the off-course duty at that time and the importance of supporting attendances at race meetings.

This equates to an annual income threshold of €12,580 (€12,580 × 20% = €2,516) under which no liability to income tax arises.I am advised that Revenue records indicate that the taxpayer received Illness Benefit income of €6,503 up to 7th October 2009.  If the taxpayer does not have another taxable source of income, which combined with the Illness Benefit would be in excess of the €12,580 threshold at the suggested date of return to work (2nd November 2009), no tax liability will arise at that date.  On resumption of work, the taxpayer is advised to request Revenue to issue a revised Tax Credit Certificate to reflect the Illness Benefit income received up to that date.

This charge is paid quarterly in advance and all payments have been made in respect of 2009 which amounts to €437,544,223.In the context of the six month review of the charge which was undertaken by my Department, and given the shortfall in monies raised from the charge to date, the charge factor levied on each institution has been amended and new, higher rates are being applied for the remainder of the Scheme.  Indeed, the monies to be received by the Exchequer in 2010 may be increased as institutions move from the existing guarantee scheme into the proposed revised guarantee scheme shortly to be brought to the Oireachtas.With regard to the recapitalisation, in return for a capital injection of €3.5bn of Core Tier 1 Capital, the Government has received €3.5bn worth of non-cumulative preference shares.  These preference shares pay a fixed coupon of 8% annually in arrears.  However, as the first payment dates due under the recapitalisation fall in 2010, no monies are to be received in 2009 in respect of the recapitalisation.In addition to the charge for the Guarantee levied on the covered institutions, institutions under the Guarantee are obliged to recoup the administrative costs of the Guarantee to the Minister.  To date payments of €2,495,459 have been made, covering the period September 2008 to April 2009.  There will be further charges made periodically between now and the end September 2010 when the Scheme is due to end.

I would like, however, to assure him that Ireland, along with its EU partners, is mindful of the obligation to ensure that the benefits of the EU-Israel Association Agreement are not granted to goods produced in Israeli settlements in either the West Bank or East Jerusalem.The origin of all goods imported into the EU must be declared to customs at the point of entry.  Where preference is being claimed under the terms of an international accord, such as the EU-Israel Association Agreement, this must be declared and appropriate documentary proofs of origin must be made available to customs.Throughout the EU, customs authorities examine this documentation either at import or as part of their post-clearance audit programmes.  Where any doubt arises, the origin of the goods will be verified through contacts with the customs authorities in the country of origin.  The procedures followed by Irish customs are similar to those operated throughout the EU.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is subject to age-related percentage limits and to an overall annual earnings cap of €150,000 for 2009. The annual earnings cap and age-related percentage limits also apply to contributions to personal pension plans (i.e. Retirement Annuity Contracts and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts). In the case of occupational pension schemes, however, employer contributions on behalf of employees do not come within the age related and annual earnings cap limits applying to employee contributions. In that regard, control is effectively exercised on employer contributions through the separate funding limit relating to the maximum benefits that can be funded for under an occupational pension scheme (i.e. a pension of two-thirds of final salary). In addition, there is a general overall limit on the capital value of tax-relieved benefits that can be drawn down in a person's lifetime – known as the Standard Fund Threshold – and which currently stands at just over €5.4 million.Employer contributions to occupational pension schemes are required to be returned annually to the Revenue Commissioners in aggregate form. Since the data is not disaggregated at the level of the employee or scheme member, there is no basis on which to estimate the impact of the change suggested in the question.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I assume that the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer's marginal income tax rate, that is, at the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans — Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) — by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. The latest data available in this regard are preliminary figures in respect of the tax year 2007.There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures. However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the overall full year yield to the Exchequer from allowing tax relief at a flat rate of 33% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about €135 million. It is assumed that tax relief at the flat rate of 33% would also be available to claimants who are currently confined to tax relief at the standard rate of 20%.The estimated Exchequer saving assumes no change in the current relief arrangements for PRSI and health levy on pension contributions and takes no account of the economic or behavioural impacts which would occur as a result of a change in tax treatment as envisaged in the question.

This is a follow on from the last such Financial Regulator report which was published in December 2008.In the December 2008 report, the figures to June 2008 were collected during a review of the procedures that are in place across all mortgage lenders in the market in relation to arrears and repossessions.  The examination shows that at end June 2008, 13,931 mortgage accounts (1.44% of residential accounts at end June 2008) were over 3 months in arrears, compared with end December 2006 when there were 11,252 accounts over 3 months in arrears (1.21% of residential accounts at end 2006). By end June 2008, credit institutions repossessed 16 properties and specialist mortgage lenders repossessed 13.Between January 2005 and June 2008, lenders repossessed 128 properties by court order. In total, the residential properties repossessed by court order in this period represent 0.01% of the total number of residential mortgage accounts reported to be held at end June 2008.On the issue of providing up-to-date statistics on the level of arrears and repossessions, my Department is currently liaising with the Central Bank regarding the Central Bank's plans to undertake further work in this area.The Deputy may wish to note that the Irish Banking Federation presented statistics on arrears and repossessions for the whole of 2008 to the Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs on 24 June 2009.  It said there were 96 repossessions in total last year, which is 0.01% of all mortgages.  There are 35 repossessions in the UK for every one in Ireland, taking population balance into account along with other factors and 1.44% of mortgages here are in arrears for three months or over. The figures they gave were for 2008. They stated the figure for the first quarter of this year is 40 repossessions.

The guidelines are available on my Department's website at:http://www.finance.gov.ie.The guidelines apply to staff of Departments and all bodies and agencies under the aegis of Departments. I have also advised my Ministerial colleagues that the same principles should be observed by Ministers and office-holders when travelling abroad on official business.The guidelines include provisions on the class of flights and standard of hotels to be used. My Department's Circular 25 of 2000 on official entertainment sets out limits on expenditure on official entertainment and the numbers that can be accommodated at any particular event.The provision of other facilities abroad is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs.

The bodies concerned are the Office of the Ombudsman, State Laboratory, Public Appointments Service, Valuation Office, Commission for Public Service Appointments, The Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works.The situation in relation to other bodies that are funded by the Exchequer is outlined below.The National Treasury Management Agency has in place a Staff Expenses Office Instruction which sets out the policies and the procedures that apply with regard to booking accommodation, travel arrangements, entertainment allowances for meals etc.  The NTMA policy is consistent with the relevant Department of Finance Circulars and Foreign Travel Policy Guidelines. The NTMA has not incurred any such expenses on behalf of a Minister or Minister of State.The Special EU Programmes Body adheres to guidance as set out in the Northern Ireland Civil Service Handbook and Department of Finance Circulars in respect of all accommodation, travel, entertainment and subsistence requirements.  Internal policies exist to ensure adherence with the appropriate guidance. The Body does not provide accommodation or travel arrangements for Ministers or Ministers of State for functions at home or abroad. Any entertainment or subsistence provided to a Minister whilst attending a Special EU Programmes Body function would be the same as that received by all other participants.

Consequently, normal commercial decisions, which include those related to interest rate policy and the management of the funding of the bank, are a matter for the Board of Anglo.Anglo has confirmed that the bank offers a competitive interest rate on a range of deposit products, but that it currently offers a leading market rate on only one of these. Also, comparisons with the deposit interest rates offered by different financial institutions need to recognise the different terms and conditions that apply to the accounts.Anglo regularly reviews the interest rate on its deposit products, including with regard to positioning relative to competitor offerings. As with all financial institutions, Anglo's commercial decisions on its deposit interest rates are influenced by a number of factors including money market interest rate movements, competitor actions, and by the bank's strategy with regard to its overall mix of funding sources.

With regard to the designation of areas for tax incentives in this jurisdiction, there are no provisions in the tax code to allow for the immediate ad hoc designation of areas for tax incentives outside the scope of an existing tax incentive scheme. In addition, the designation of any such area for tax incentives would have to comply with the relevant State aid rules and be approved by the European Commission before such designation could proceed.

The restructuring plan will consider all options for the future of Anglo. This plan will have to be approved by me and will be submitted to the European Commission for approval under EU State Aid rules by end-November.Anglo is a major financial institution whose viability is of systemic importance to Ireland. The bank has a balance sheet in excess of €88bn and a substantial deposit base, which the Government is determined to safeguard. The Government therefore took the decision to take Anglo into public ownership and subsequently to provide €4bn in capital to the bank in order to maintain Anglo's viability.As I have stated previously, these actions were taken by the Government to protect the economy from the wider losses that would have occurred in the event of a failure of the bank, to protect Anglo's deposit base, and to prevent the bank becoming a systemic threat.

The following additional categories have been so determined: youth, welfare, national heritage, and amenities. Under the legislation, the allocation of funding among the categories is a matter for the Government. There is no specific formula for the allocation of funding among categories. The Government decides on an annual basis how the surplus from the National Lottery is to be allocated in the context of the overall Estimates process.The percentage of National Lottery funding which was spent on each of the categories is as follows:Area199920002001200220032004%%%%%%Sport202327404446National Culture1564222Arts1098679Health887665Youth151414121313Welfare232828241816National Heritage344433Amenities688676100100100100100100Since 2005, the total allocation for subheads which had formerly been funded entirely from the proceeds of the National Lottery has exceeded the funds available from the National Lottery.

The application of the age range is being interpreted as generously as possible, to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.  This will mean that, in January 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2005 or on or before 30 June 2006 will qualify.  Children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will qualify for the free pre-school year in September 2010.  However, children who qualify for the pre-school year in September 2010 will not benefit from it if their parents choose to send them to primary school instead.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	350	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) as well as the new free preschool year of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which is being introduced from January next.The NCIP provides capital grant funding for the development and refurbishment of child care services as well as support funding for community based child care services, under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to disadvantaged and low income working parents.Capital expenditure over the course of the NCIP is expected to amount to approximately €190 million and create over 25,000 additional child care places.  I regret to advise the Deputy that, due to the economic turndown, the capital programme closed to new applicants in April of this year.The new ECCE scheme, will allow qualifying children to avail of a free pre-school place in the year before they commence primary school.  In January 2010, the scheme is open to private and community based pre-school services which are notified to the Health Service Executive (HSE) or registered with the Irish Montessori Educational Board (IMEB).Services which choose to participate in the scheme, will receive grant funding from my Office based on a capitation fee of €2,450 per annum for each qualifying child.  In return, the service will be required to provide appropriate programme based activities as part of the free pre-school year.  Full details of the scheme, including the terms and conditions which will apply, are available on my Office's website at www.omcya.ie.Following the announcement of the scheme in April of this year, my Office wrote to pre-school services operating in the State, inviting them to apply in respect of the period January to August 2010.  I understand that the Montessori service referred to by the Deputy has applied to participate in the ECCE scheme and, subject to contractual requirements being met, would be expected to receive grant funding from my Office in January 2010.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I have considered all the relevant advice available to me in relation to the potential public health benefits of HPV vaccination in the prevention of cervical cancer and the wider policy implications for its possible introduction into the National Immunisation Programme. I accept the consensus view of the relevant expert bodies that the introduction of a universal high uptake vaccination programme in young girls, in conjunction with population based cervical screening, could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer incidence. All of the clinical advice available to me indicates that, in the context of the limited resources available, the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme should take precedence over the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme.The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has completed an assessment of the cost effectiveness of HPV. It shows that the vaccine does have the potential to play an important long term role in the prevention of cervical cancer and that a vaccination programme should be put in place to enable these long term benefits to be realised.Accordingly, in August 2008, the Health Service Executive (HSE) was requested by the Department to examine operational and procurement issues relating to the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme for 12 year old girls on a basis that would achieve maximum cost effectiveness and appropriate national uptake rates.I am keeping the cost of implementing such a programme under review.  I am committed to progressively introducing cancer prevention measures, such as new screening and vaccination programmes, according to clinical prioritisation within the resources available in 2010 and beyond.

It is not clear at this time the extent to which this is due to individuals ceasing to hold private health insurance or to individuals not taking out private health insurance for the first time.In the case of individuals who may have ceased to hold private health insurance, no survey of reasons for such a possible cessation has taken place, so it is not possible for me to give any numbers of or statement with regard to individuals who have ceased to hold private health insurance due to income pressure.Data is not available at this time with regard to the use of health services by persons who may have ceased to hold cover.  However, all persons who hold private health insurance also have eligibility for services as public patients in acute hospitals which they can use while holding private health insurance cover.The table shows changes in the numbers and percentage of the population covered under a private health insurance contract from 2007 to the end of June 2009.Total% Pop000’s%Mar-072,19250.8Jun-072,20450.8Sep-072,22651.1Dec-072,24551.2Mar-082,25451.2Jun-082,26951.3Sep-082,28251.6Dec-082,29952.0Mar-092,28651.7Jun-092,27851.5

More generally, PAD monitors overall performance in relation to the timely issue of replies and provides a central contact for all requests from Oireachtas members for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the Executive. It reports on a regular basis to the Chief Executive Officer and his management team.In 2008, a timeframe of 15 working days for replies was introduced for Parliamentary Questions referred to the Executive for direct reply.  The most recent statistics provided to my Department by the Executive show that in the period from January to October 6th 2009, 62% of questions referred to the Executive were answered within the 15 day timeframe. A further 4% were answered within 20 days. 71% of referred questions were answered within 30 days. I will continue to stress the importance of meeting the 15 day timeframe at my regular meetings with the CEO of the HSE.The Deputy tabled three questions on July 7th 2009 which were referred to the HSE PAD for direct reply. The numbers of these questions were 27145/09, 27256/09 and 27820/09.

Significant progress was made in the National Service Plan 2009 in terms of incorporating more explicit links between funding, staffing and services and the development of an improved set of activity measures, performance indicators and deliverables in key service areas, which are matched with timescales.  These improvements form a framework for achieving greater clarity at an individual service unit level within the HSE on performance expectations regarding service delivery, staffing levels and funding. My Department has an agreed monitoring framework with the HSE and receives detailed comprehensive monthly reports on all aspects of progression of the National Service Plan, including information on activity measures and performance indicators. These Performance Reports are published on the HSE’s website each month following approval by the HSE Board.Policy for the development of mental health services is outlined in ‘A Vision for Change', the report of the expert group on mental health policy.  The aim is to migrate from the traditional institutional based model to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service, where need for hospital admission is greatly reduced, whilst still providing in-patient care when appropriate.  The performance measures and associated targets in the mental health area for 2009 are published as part of the National Service Plan 2009 and are included for ease of reference in a table.  Examples of measures include (i) the number of child and adolescent mental health teams and (ii) the number of inpatient places per 100,000 population.  The August Performance Report advises that the number of child and adolescent mental health teams has increased from 47 teams at the end of December 2008 to 54 at the end of August 2009.  The National Service Plan target is 55 by end 2009 and there is an ultimate target of 99 teams as specified in ‘A Vision for Change'.  The number of inpatient places per 100,000 population stands at 28.5 at the end of June (following an end December 2008 outturn of 30.7), against a full year target of 25.Some of the measures outlined in the National Service Plan were included for the first time in 2009 with a view to the development and progression of the data by the end of the year.  My Department is working on an ongoing collaborative basis with the HSE to further develop and refine performance measures across all service areas, including mental health, to ensure that they are as robust and meaningful as possible and reflect key priorities and international best practice as well as being comparable both within the EU and further afield.Last week I received the first biannual report against the HSE Corporate Plan 2008-2011 which charts progress against desired medium and longer term objectives and priorities as set out in the Corporate Plan and implemented annually through the National Service Plan.  This will facilitate the Department and the HSE in mapping performance trends across the health sector, including mental health, to inform future strategic and annual service planning.  My Department and the HSE are also working under the auspices of a joint performance information group to streamline and simplify collation and presentation of information which will provide more capacity for better use and analysis of data.   The continued development of HealthStat by the HSE is also part of our ongoing co-ordinated approach to monitoring and measuring health service performance at national level.  These developments will facilitatea clearer link between information and action at all levels of the health system, from operational management to short and medium term planning to long term policy and strategy development.

As the further matter raised is a service issue it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The Government has demonstrated its commitment to people with disabilities. Even in 2009, a very difficult year, it provided additional funding of €10 million for the provision of 125 additional therapy posts (speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and social workers) in disability and mental health services targeted at children with disabilities of school-going age. These posts have now been allocated to priority areas of need identified by the Health Service Executive, in particular to address gaps in existing services for children with disabilities. A recruitment process is well underway and the majority of these posts will be filled this month with the remainder to be filled in December.With respect to the 2010 Budget, the Government will be considering the Estimates over the next couple of months, in the context of its target to reduce the general government deficit to 3% of GDP by 2013 as part of its strategy for economic recovery. As part of the Estimates process, my Department and the Health Service Executive are examining options which might provide expenditure savings next year, while to the greatest extent possible meeting the objective of maintaining population health and access to services.  This process is being informed by the recommendations of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and other relevant considerations. Deliberations by Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time. The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.

It is included in the pandemic vaccine, Pandemrix, in order to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination of the vaccine when the multidose vial is opened.The mercury content of thimerosal has led to concerns that it may affect brain development when given in vaccines. Based on a large amount of scientific data, the WHO, the United States Institute of Medicine and the European Medicines Agency have concluded that the evidence favours no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.Pandemrix also contains an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance that enhances the immune response to the viral protein. Benefits of using an adjuvant include better cross-protection from other influenza strains and also means that less viral material is used in each dose so that more vaccine can be produced. This adjuvant has been tested in clinical trials involving several thousand people and the safety profile is considered to be acceptable.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	361	There are three routes by which a person aged 70 or over may qualify for a medical card.  Firstly, under the Health Act 2008, a single person will qualify if his/her gross income is €700 per week or less.  The figure for a couple is €1,400 per week or less.  The 2008 Act does not allow any discretion to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to grant medical cards to persons who are in excess of these gross income thresholds.Secondly, a person who does not qualify for a medical card by virtue of the gross income limits in the 2008 Act will qualify if his/her net income is €201.50 or less.  In the case of a couple, their net income must be €298 or less.  Medical, nursing and other relevant expenses are taken into account when using the net income thresholds to assess a person's eligibility.   Thirdly, if a person does not qualify under either the gross or net income thresholds, the HSE may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for himself/herself and any dependants.  Special net income thresholds were used prior to the enactment of the Health Act 2008 to assess eligibility where a person aged under 70 years was married to a medical card holder aged 70 years or over.  These special thresholds have been discontinued as couples now qualify for a medical card under the 2008 Act if their joint weekly gross income does not exceed the significantly higher figure of €1,400.  If they do not qualify under this assessment, they may still qualify for a card on a discretionary basis as outlined above.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	362	In line with Government Policy the Health Service Executive is refocusing its services to give people direct access in the community to multi-disciplinary teams including general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps and occupational therapists. This policy is designed not only to maintain and support people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, but to decrease the need for acute hospital attendance, to facilitate early discharge, to shorten length of stay and to ensure the best use of available resources.In the primary care area almost 130 Primary Care Teams are now in place. The HSE aims to have 210 Primary Care Teams in place by the end of 2009 and a total of 530 by 2011. The HSE is reassigning staff working in primary, community and continuing care services to work in Primary Care Teams to support this. In addition the HSE in recent years has invested heavily in developing both community supports and long stay residential community nursing units, which supports older persons, and their carers, in being cared for at home, or where this is not possible, in an appropriate residential setting. This has facilitated earlier discharge from acute hospital settings, and has helped prevent inappropriate admission to hospital.The recent appointment of a National Director for Clinical and Quality Care in the HSE and the introduction of the clinical directorate model incorporating executive authority for the clinical director will be important in the context of progressing towards a more integrated patient focused health service.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	365	To date, eight officials at Principal Officer or higher level, representing 7.5 whole equivalents, have applied and been approved for the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement in my Department.  This represents 1.5% of the total number employed as of 30 September 2009.   The final closing date for applications for the scheme has recently been extended by the Department of Finance to 23rd October 2009.   Therefore the figures quoted above may be subject to change.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	366	There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme, which was introduced on a statutory basis in 1971. Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, which was introduced in 1999, no individual or family unit pays more than €100 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I recently met with a deputation from the group in question.  The group briefed me on their work and financial support needs, all of which I have noted. The 2009 budget allocation of the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department is over €48m, a decrease of some 8% on the 2008 figure.  I explained to the group that in light of budgetary constraints it is intended that the 2009 Youth Affairs budget will continue to focus on supporting existing programmes and services for young people including those with fewer opportunities.  In that context, the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department is not in a position to consider any new applications for admission to its schemes in the current year.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The Bill has passed through the Seanad and is scheduled to be debated in Dail Eireann during the current session. The new legislation is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child. This applies in the case of adoptions from Russia and other countries who have not, as yet, ratified the Hague Convention and would seem unlikely to do so in the immediate future. Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.Neither the Adoption Board nor the HSE have a statutory function in relation to the provision of post placement reports, though they have, and continue to, facilitate the preparation of same. The key commitment given is the legal affidavit, required of all applicants, to cooperate with the provision of such reports. Recent discussions have focused on the completion and submission to the Russian authorities of a number of outstanding post-placement reports from adoptive parents in respect of children already adopted from Russia. This issue is being followed up by the Adoption Board and the HSE with the parents involved. I understand that the greater number of the outstanding reports have been competed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation — that is, the social workers have already conducted the home visit and the report. In a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with their social worker. Further contact has been made again to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and is being prioritised by the Health Service Executive Adoption Services to ensure that parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian embassy in Dublin.Preliminary work has been undertaken on the development of a bilateral agreement with the Russian authorities on intercountry adoption and discussions in this regard take account of the provisions of the Adoption Bill 2009.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	370	Since the publication of the White Paper on Private Health Insurance in 1999, Government policy has been to move towards charging the full economic cost of private patient care and to end the subsidisation of private practice in public hospitals, while being sensitive to the need for continuing stability in the private health insurance market.  This policy has seen significant increases in private charges in recent years.A Value for Money and Policy Review of the Economic Cost and Charges Associated with Private and Semi-Private Treatment Services in Public Hospitals is currently being undertaken by my Department.  The purpose of the Review is to carry out a detailed analysis of the costs and charges associated with providing private and semi-private services in public hospitals and to examine the fee collection processes used to recoup the cost of these services from private health insurance companies.  Appropriate recommendations will be formulated in each of the areas of cost, charge and fee collection when the review is completed.  These will be considered when the Review process is completed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I am advised by the HSE that there are currently 2,337 medical consultants in the public health system, of whom 1,986 are permanent and 351 are temporary/part-time locums.  It would be difficult to calculate precise savings on the basis of the Deputy's suggestion, since the years of service of each consultant would have to be inputted to an assumed, but unspecified, salary scale between the starting salary and the top point of the salary scale.  In addition, the extent of non-salary remuneration for each consultant in such a revised contract would have to be factored in, if a total remuneration cap per person of €150,000 were in place.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The Government is committed to proceeding with the current hospital co-location programme. It is the responsibility of the successful bidders to arrange the financing of the individual co-location projects.  However it is an essential requirement that each co-location project demonstrates clear value for money to the taxpayer.The Finance Act 2009 provides that the schemes of capital allowances for private hospitals and certain other health facilities will be terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development.  Provided that a co-located private hospital project conforms to the requirements of these transitional arrangements, and otherwise satisfies the general requirements of the scheme of capital allowances, the tax relief will apply.  The value of the tax relief in each case will depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure.  I do not accept that, relative to its value, a high proportion of tax would be forgone by the Exchequer in respect of co-location projects as additional revenues would accrue to the Exchequer from the extra activity generated by the construction of the hospitals, the employment arising and the related services provided on which taxes will be paid.As regards the costs incurred by the HSE on its legal and other expenses in respect of the co-location initiative, there is a requirement on each of the preferred bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement.  The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I propose to take Questions Nos. 269, 295 and 296 together.I have no plans to nationalise the wholesale distribution of drugs and medicines supplied under the GMS and community drugs schemes.My Department and the Health Service Executive (HSE) have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, from manufacturers and wholesalers through to community pharmacists, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill.On 1 July 2009, I made regulations to reduce payments to community pharmacists under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The main changes were a reduction in the wholesale mark-up paid on drugs from 17.66% to 10%, a common sliding dispensing fee across all schemes and a reduction in the retail mark-up paid on a number of schemes (Drug Payment Scheme, Long Term Illness, etc) from 50% to 20%. These changes are expected to result in savings in 2010 of approximately €133 million. Savings of €55 million are expected in 2009.Generic drugs are available in Ireland for many medicines. In 2008, 18% of prescription items under the GMS scheme and 11% of items under the Drugs Payment Scheme and Long Term Illness Scheme were dispensed generically.In 2008, expenditure on proprietary drugs where there was an equivalent generic available under the GMS, Drugs Payment Scheme and Long Term Illness Scheme was €227 million. The HSE estimates that there is a price differential of approximately 10% between off-patent proprietary drugs and their generic equivalents.  This suggests that approximately €23 million in savings per annum could be made if there were full generic substitution of products supplied under the GMS, DPS and LTI.My Department and the HSE are continuing to examine all aspects of pharmaceutical expenditure with a view to containing costs including options for the introduction of a system of reference pricing coupled with generic substitution.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I understand the Deputy's question relates to the fees associated with the system of registering and inspecting nursing homes.   As the Deputy is aware under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) for inspecting and registering categories of centres, including nursing homes.HIQA commenced the new system of registration and inspection on July 1st, 2009.  This has, for the first time, introduced an independent system of inspection of both public and private nursing homes. The Authority's inspection process comprises three parts: pre-assessment, the inspection visit and report completion including a process of fact-checking and verification. Since July 1, the Authority has commenced 88 inspections. Of these, 46 were announced and 42 were unannounced visits. The average duration of inspection visits to date has been two days. Of the 88 inspection processes commenced, four have reached conclusion with the publication of reports. The remaining reports will be published shortly.It is important that this new inspection regime is effective, robust, independent and properly resourced.  In this regard the 2007 Act provides for the following fees:Applications for registration or renewal of registration under Section 48.  This section states that the applicant shall include with the application the prescribed application fee.An annual fee payable by the registered provider under Section 99.A fee for variation or removal of any conditions of the registration under Section 52.  A registered provider making an application under this section must include the fee with their application.Following analysis of the types of centres, numbers of places, etc. it was decided to set a registration fee of €500, payable every 3 years by each nursing home together with an annual fee of €190 per place in each registered centre.   It is estimated that the fee will represent an average weekly cost of €3.73 per registered place.  The fees are payable by the registered provider (or in the case of applications for registration by the applicant, who for existing designated centres would normally be the registered provider). These fees are not due or payable by the resident or their family.In addition article 28 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 states that"(1) The registered provider shall agree a contract with the resident within one month of the admission of that resident to the designated centre.(2) Such contract shall deal with the care and welfare of the resident in the designated centre and shall include details of the services to be provided for that resident and the fees to be charged."Therefore, only those fees, including any agreed increases, set out in the contract should be charged by the registered provider to the resident.

I am satisfied that the most generous possible interpretation of the qualifying age range is being applied, in that children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year will be held to qualify.  This will mean that, in January 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2005 or on or before 30 June 2006 will qualify.  In September 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2006 or on or before 30 June 2007 will qualify, and so on in subsequent years.

Children who are within the qualifying age range on 1 September will qualify for the duration of that year.  Children who will be within the qualifying age range on 1 September of the following year will qualify for that year.

This is equivalent to approximately €276 per month, where a service is participating for 38 weeks or €207 per month, where it participates for 50 weeks.  This payment will be made, in advance, at the beginning of each term.A higher capitation rate of €75 per week (€2,850 p.a.) was announced in July of this year and will be available to sessional playschool services in which all child care workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the scheme.  To qualify for the higher capitation rate all Pre-School Leaders in the service must hold a level 7 or 8 qualification relating to child care and have 3 years' experience working in the sector, and all assistants must hold a relevant level 5 qualification.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	384	At present EU food labelling legislation is harmonised by Council Directive 2000/13/EC, transposed in 2002, with several amendments since.  In January 2008, the European Commission presented its proposals on updating and harmonising this legislation. The proposal is still under discussion.  This proposal consolidated existing legislation in the area of food labelling and introduced new provisions for Country of Origin Labelling, a mandatory nutrition declaration and allergen labelling, amongst others.In November 2008, Ireland submitted its position paper on the proposal.  I have arranged for a copy of this position paper to be sent to the Deputy's office.  This paper was informed by submissions made to the FSAI by many of the key stakeholders. Ireland's position will be further informed by the outcome of an FSAI Consumer Survey.  This ended in June 2009 and final results are expected shortly. In its position paper, Irelandsupports mandatory Country of Origin Labelling,shares the concerns of a significant number of other member states with regard  to National Schemes,welcomes the proposal for mandatory allergen labelling and supports the highlighting of allergens on labels,supports the equal treatment of all alcohol products,asks that consideration should be given to bringing alcohol products into the scope of the legislation,supports the retention of the Commission's proposal with regard to the use of "per portion" expression alone in certain cases,does not support the proposal for a minimum font size of 3mm for display of mandatory particulars and suggests that other aids to legibility, such as contrasting background, be explored,shares the concerns of some other member states regarding possible flaws in the calculation of Reference Intakes,feels that a lower "significant amount" should be stipulated for foods and beverages with low contents of dried matter,supports the inclusion of trans fats, in the mandatory nutrition declaration.During 2009 a number of meetings have taken place at European Union Working Group level, attended by officials from the Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The European Commission labelling proposal, states that, where country of origin is included on the label, the place of birth, rearing and slaughter of the animal, where different from the country of origin must also be stated.  On 16th March 2009, the European Parliament examined the proposal.  Parliament has indicated however, that it will not be in a position to conduct the first reading of the document until early 2010.  The next meeting is due to take place on 26 October 2009.Ireland is continuing to build support, among other member states for mandatory country of origin labelling.  At this stage, the proposal will not be finalised until 2010.

The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The Bill has passed through the Seanad and is scheduled to be debated in Dáil Eireann during the current session.  The new legislation is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  This applies in the case of adoptions from Ethiopia and other countries who have not, as yet, ratified the Hague Convention, and would seem unlikely to do so in the immediate future.  Future inter-country adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill, 2009, when enacted. Only adoptions effected before the commencement of the Act can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.

This is designed to maintain people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, decrease hospital attendances and facilitate early hospital discharge and supported care at home.The HSE plans to have 530 Primary Care Teams by 2011. Almost 130 Teams are already in place and the HSE aims to have 210 Teams in place by the end of 2009.Chronic Disease Management Programmes are operating in a number of Teams and the HSE plans to further roll out such Programmes to a larger number of Teams.

The central elements of the current statutory accountability framework within which the HSE operates are: the Annual National Service Plan, the Annual Financial Statements, the three year Corporate Plan and the Code of Governance.  The Service and Corporate Plans and the Code of Governance are subject to my approval and are then laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, the HSE is required to obtain my prior written permission for major capital spending.Responding to the information needs of the Oireachtas and the public is a priority for my Department and is a regular agenda item at meetings between myself and the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive.The operation of the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE (PAD) allows for the centralised receipt, assignment and tracking of Parliamentary Questions within the HSE's extensive network of operations. More generally, PAD monitors overall performance in relation to the timely issue of replies and provides a central contact for all requests from Oireachtas members for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the Executive. It reports on a regular basis to the Chief Executive Officer and his management team.As part of an ongoing process of meeting its obligations with regard to accountability and transparency, the HSE currently uploads replies to Parliamentary Questions on its public website, www.hse.ie. It should be noted that the Executive can only do this where responses to questions do not contain material which may be subject to exclusion under the provisions of Data Protection legislation. This includes replies to questions concerning the provision of services to a named individual.The HSE routinely furnishes Oireachtas members with press releases and other documents, as prescribed in SI No. 798 of 2005,  the Health Act 2004 (Dealings with members of either House of the Oireachtas) Regulations 2005.As the Deputy will be aware, Parliamentary Questions relating to operational matters within the health services are referred to the HSE for direct reply.

Aer Lingus is an independent Company and it has to make decisions on a commercial basis. The State's 25% shareholding does not confer on the Government a right to influence commercial decisions at the Company.The Government is satisfied from all of the information available to it that a major restructuring of the Group's cost base is essential if Aer Lingus is to survive. This restructuring is a matter for the company. It is my belief that if that restructuring does not take place urgently the airline will find it difficult to survive in the long term and all jobs in the company could be at risk.  I understand that a consultation process between management and staff is now underway and I would encourage all parties to engage constructively in that process. The industrial relations mechanisms of the State are available to assist in reaching an agreed outcome for all concerned.

Within my own Department various elements of expenditure contribute to the delivery of Smarter Travel, including the public transport investment under Transport 21, which in 2009 includes a provision of €2 million for sustainable transport measures.I assume the Question refers to the allocation of specific funding for new initiatives outside the Transport 21 envelope under Smarter Travel.  There are two particular allocations, which are relevant in 2009, the capital allocation of €10 million for carbon reduction measures and a sum of €2 million under current expenditure for the Green Schools Travel Programme.In relation to the latter the criteria for delivery of this programme include the number of schools and schoolchildren to be reached by the programme and targets for reduction in car travel to and from and school and for increased walking and cycling.  The criteria and targets are captured in a formal Service Level Agreement between my Department and the Dublin Transportation Office.In relation to the capital allocation of €10 million for 2009, much of this is focused on demonstration cycling projects to begin the radical transformation of cycling provision in Ireland.  Submissions are received from Local Authorities and the key criterion is that the project must be exemplary in providing for cyclists by being largely off-road and of sufficient width to accommodate two-way cycling in most cases.  The capital allocation also supports the Smarter Travel Project Fund and the Smarter Travel Areas Fund both of which I launched this year and the criteria for which can be accessed on www.smartertravel.ie

The report contains two recommendations, (1) the implementation of Council Directive 92/29/EEC on the minimum safety and health requirements for improved medical treatment on board vessels and (2) the revision and reissue of relevant Marine Notices.With regard to recommendation (1), Directive 92/29/EEC was given effect in 1997 by the European Communities (Minimum Safety and Health Requirements for Improved Medical Treatment on Board Vessels) Regulations (S.I. No. 506 of 1997).  These Regulations make it obligatory to provide certain medical facilities on board seagoing vessels, including fishing vessels.   Section 9(1) of the 1997 regulations provided for the establishment of a Radio Medical Consultation Centre, known as MEDICO Cork, to provide mariners with free medical advice by radio on a 24-hour basis. The operation of MEDICO Cork is regularly reviewed and is being further expanded in the delivery of new services.In relation to recommendation (2), Marine Notice No. 36 of 1997 gave notice of the transposition of the Directive into Irish law, summarising the requirements of the Regulations and appending a medical guide for the medicines and medical equipment required on vessels.   Marine Notice No. 28 of 2001 gave notice of the establishment of MEDICO Cork and detailed how to make contact with the unit.With regard to the Marine Notices it is intended to review and refresh them to take account of the new MCIB recommendation and to reissue as appropriate.

Prior to the audit a very significant amount of information must be submitted to ICAO and my Department and the IAA are intensively engaged in those preparations at present.Earlier this month I announced my intention to amalgamate the safety regulation functions of the IAA and the Commission for Aviation Regulation with the planned new National Transport Authority.  Detailed proposals will be developed to implement this decision in the coming months.In light of the above, and of the need to ensure efficiency and value for money in the current economic climate, I do not propose to proceed with a further independent examination of the IAA at this time.  The requirements under Section 32 of the 1993 Act will be considered in the context of the legislation I will bring forward to provide for the amalgamation of the IAA's safety regulatory functions into the National Transport Authority.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	418	The number, location and size of commercial airports must be assessed by reference to overall aviation policy objectives and the costs and benefits of exchequer support for regional airports in particular. Our major aviation policy objective is to promote regular, safe, cost effective and competitive air services linking the country with key business and tourism markets.  The sustainable development of the three State Airports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon is a key aspect of the implementation of this policy objective.In addition the six smaller regional airports in Ireland (Ireland West Airport Knock; Kerry Airport; Waterford South East Regional Airport; Donegal Airport; Sligo Airport and Galway Airport) play a complementary role in promoting regional integration and encouraging inward investment and tourism by providing air access to the regions. The existing regional airports programme receives a range of exchequer assistance such as capital expenditure grants, operational subvention and compensation for the operation of Public Service Obligations (PSO) air services.The current PSO contracts commenced on 22 July 2008 and run to 20 July 2011. The contracts have been awarded for services linking Dublin Airport with the regional airports at Derry, Donegal, Sligo, Ireland West Airport Knock, Galway and Kerry Airports.  Under updated EU legislation governing these services, more stringent conditions will apply in the future having regard, for example, to the availability of other transport connections and especially rail services with a travelling time of three hours or less.I expect that a Value for Money review of regional airports being carried out within my Department will assist me in evaluating the appropriate scale of a regional airports programme in the future bearing in mind my aviation policy objectives, the improved surface transport links under the NDP and Transport 21 and the need to address secure best value for the more limited Exchequer resources available.

It is an offence to make a false declaration in the application for a permit, and to forge, alter or illegally use or lend a permit.On-street enforcement has been strengthened in that Gardaí and local authority traffic wardens have been given power to inspect permits and to detain any permit that is invalid or is being used in an illegal manner.The fixed charge of €80 (increasing to €120 after 28 days) that applies to illegal parking in a designated disabled persons parking bay is double the amount of fixed charge that applies to any other illegal parking offence.  I am satisfied with this level of fixed charge and have no plans to alter it.

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary County Councils have undertaken the development of a proposal for a new Shannon Crossing.From 2004 to the end of 2008, State road grants totalling €819,318 have been provided to develop proposals for the proposed new bridge. In February 2008, Clare County Council, in association with North Tipperary County Council, appointed consultants to carry out a constraints study, route selection and preliminary design for the scheme.  A further grant of €600,000 was allocated in 2009 to Clare County Council, which is now the lead authority for the project, to finance continuation of that work. The 2010 regional and local road grant allocations will be announced early in the new year.

Subject to the feasibility study being satisfactory, the DAA advises that it may be possible to advance the project on a joint basis.The Ireland-U.S. Preclearance Agreement signed by me and the then U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, on 17 November 2008, does not provide for the preclearance of cargo.  However, this is an issue which I raised with Secretary Chertoff at the time and more recently with his successor Janet Napolitano. Both were receptive to giving further consideration to cargo preclearance from Ireland, having regard to experience of passenger preclearance.

As was made clear in the official guidelines for this special fund, support was provided on a once-off basis.This organisation also benefits from assistance under the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme which comes under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Funding of €864,476 has been provided to it for delivery of the programme in 2009.  I understand that some €15,000 has been provided by the Partnership for the centre referred to in the question.Pobal will shortly be conducting a call for applications on behalf of my Office under the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals and the European Refugee Fund and this organisation may wish to consider applying.

The renewal or extension of an applicant's permission to remain is a matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. In this regard, I am informed that the most recent permission to remain granted to the person concerned expired on 17 September, 2009.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 1 March 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him, He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned.Following consideration of his case under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 27 April 2005. Notice of this order was served by registered post, dated 4 May 2005, placing a legal requirement on the person concerned to ‘present' himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 12 May 2005 in order to make arrangements for his removal from the State. The person concerned presented, as required, on this occasion but failed to present on a subsequent occasion and was therefore classified as a person who was evading his deportation.By letter dated 24 June 2008, the legal representative of the person concerned lodged an application for revocation of the Deportation Order, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). Following consideration of the information submitted, the Deportation Order was affirmed and the person concerned and his legal representative were advised of this decision by letter dated 14 November 2008. In addition, the person concerned was required to present himself to the GNIB on 20 November 2008 in order to make arrangements for his removal from the State. The person concerned presented, as required, on this occasion but failed to present on a subsequent occasion and was therefore classified as a person who was evading his deportation. Should he come to the notice of the Gardaí, he would be liable to arrest and detention. He should, therefore, present himself to the GNIB without any further delay.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the GNIB.

As this process has yet to produce sufficient information to allow arrangements be made and so as to avoid having to interfere in the privacy of those victims or bereaved who might not welcome direct contact, a public information notice will appear in newspapers shortly asking those who wish to access such services through this channel to register their interest.   This will allow arrangements for the provision of these services to be finalised.

The vehicle was retained for evidential purposes in accordance with legislation and was technically and forensically examined. It is also my understanding that the vehicle was returned to its owner on 27th July, 2009.Both the High and Supreme Court have determined that An Garda Síochána has both a right and a duty to take possession of and retain any evidence which may affect the guilt or innocence of an accused person.It has always been the case that there is no scheme of financial assistance for innocent third parties where property has to be retained for evidential purposes. However, the general issue has been raised on a number of occasions and I have asked my Department, in conjunction with the Garda authorities and the Office of the Attorney General, to review arrangements for the retention of property as evidence in criminal cases.

Against that background, the updated positions are as set out hereunder. All figures relate to the positions as they applied at 30 September 2009 with all twelve month figures based on the year from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2009.At 30 September 2009, 12,904 cases were recorded as awaiting a decision under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) i.e. as to whether a Deportation Order should be made or Leave to Remain in the State granted. However, this figure  includes 3,369 cases where applications for Subsidiary Protection in the State have been submitted by the same persons. Where an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State has been submitted, this application must be determined before consideration can be given to the position in the State of the same person under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).The following is the statistical information sought by the Deputy.Number(a) Deportation Orders signed1,106(b) Leave to Remain granted761(c) Voluntary Returns concluded571Total (a) + (b) + (c)2,438(d) Cases awaiting decision12,904(ii) New cases arising between 1 October 2008 and 30 September 2009The Deputy might note that there is no application process as such in the context of cases arising under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). However, the number of such cases generated in the period in question can be obtained by aggregating the numbers of ‘notification of intention to deport' letters issued under all headings within that period. A notification of intention to deport, as provided for under Section 3 (3) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), is issued to a person who has become illegal in the State following the formal refusal of their asylum application or where they have otherwise become ‘illegal' e.g. following the expiry of a Work Permit or visa based permission to remain in the State. Any person served with such a notification is invited to (i) leave to State voluntarily, (ii)  consent to deportation or (iii) submit written representations setting out reasons as to why they should not have a Deportation Order made against them. The majority of persons faced with these options proceed to submit written representations and such representations must be considered before a final decision is made. The Deputy might wish to note that in the context of failed asylum seekers, the option also exists for making an application for Subsidiary Protection which again is availed of in the majority of situations. The following figures relate to the period in question.NumberNotifications of intention to deport (asylum origin)3,350Notifications of intention to deport (non-asylum origin)660+Total4,010+As stated previously, it is not possible to provide an average waiting time for the processing of cases arising under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) primarily because no two cases will be the same in terms of their complexity. The Deputy should also note that the consideration of such cases is a hugely resource intensive process given that a wide range of factors have to be considered by the Minister in each individual case.In terms of efforts being made to speed up processing times, the Deputy can again be assured that strenuous efforts have been made and continue to be made to ensure that such cases are processed as promptly as possible. Towards this end, additional staff members have been deployed to this area and considerable investment has been made in the development of technology required to support the processing of such cases.

Of these 161 were subsequently deported. From 1 January 2009 to  30 September 2009 the total number of Deportation Orders signed was 860 of which 193 have subsequently been enforced.The enforcement of Deportation Orders is and remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.While every effort is made to effect these orders as speedily as possible the process is regularly delayed by judicial challenges commenced by persons who are due to be deported. Evasion of deportation orders is also a factor that can lead to delays in removing people from the state.

The vast majority of the removals involved persons whose asylum applications were refused.Set out in a table are the costs for 2008 and up to 30 September 2009 of the removal of persons subject to Deportation Orders, by scheduled and charter flights. These figures include the travel costs relating to the deportees and their Garda escorts.YearCost of scheduled/commercial and charter flights€2008927,0912009 (up to 30 September)520,925The Deputy might wish to note that the figures above do not include the cost of overtime or subsistence payments for Garda escorts.My Department deports persons to non — European Economic Area (EEA) countries. To identify the ten most expensive deportations would involve a disproportionate use of resources in disaggregating those individual costs from the cost figures quoted above. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the single most expensive deportation in 2008 involved the removal of a Ghanaian man on 11 March 2008 at a cost of €151,900, while the most expensive removal to date in 2009 involved the removal of a Georgian man on 27 March 2009 at a cost of €35,888. In both cases attempts to remove the men by scheduled flight were unsuccessful due to their violent reactions to their deportation. For safety reasons they were subsequently removed by charter flights.The numbers of persons deported in 2008 and up to 30 September 2009 are as follows:YearDeportation Orders effected20081612009 (up to 30 September)193Total354

More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order following a comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State. In addition he has been evading his deportation since 10 August 2004 and should therefore present himself to the Garda Authorities without any further delay.As a matter of policy, I do not intend to reward persons who have failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process, and who have thereafter proceeded to evade their deportation for several years, by granting such persons residency in the State. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there has been a change in the circumstances of the person concerned, or new information has come to light which has a direct bearing on his case, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of his Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. However I wish to make clear that such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

Following my request to the Garda Síochána Inspectorate to assess the need to establish a dedicated Missing Persons Unit within An Garda Síochána, including a response similar to Amber Alert, and to report their findings to me, the Inspectorate published its report earlier this year.  One of its main recommendations was that an emergency alert system for missing children, similar to the Amber Alert system in place in other countries, should be established.  I gave the go ahead for the implementation of this recommendation.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have commenced preparatory work in that respect. A State-wide emergency system will provide An Garda Síochána with access to on-air broadcasters and other means of communication during the critical time in the event of child abduction.  The application of such an alert system relies on the cooperation of agencies including telephone service providers, print and electronic media and television and radio service providers, as well as Government Departments and agencies. As the Inspectorate's report recognises, this is a challenging task which requires the support of a range of government agencies, NGOs and private sector representatives.  It is not possible at this point to indicate a precise timeframe within which the system would go live. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that all requests for cooperation received from the Spanish police through Interpol have been serviced.  Any further requests from the Spanish authorities will receive appropriate attention. I am further informed that there is a Garda liaison officer based in the Irish Embassy in Madrid who will process any requests from the Spanish authorities regarding the matter referred to by the Deputy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	466	The Government continues to attach a high priority to the development of relations between Ireland and the global Irish. Through the Emigrant Support Programme, managed by my Department, we have allocated some €60 million to Irish welfare and community organisations across the world since 2004. Of these funds, almost $15 million has been awarded to community organisations in the United States.Successive Irish Governments have built a multilayered relationship with the global Irish which has contributed in significant ways towards the success of the peace process in Northern Ireland and to the development of our economy.  As part of our commitment to build on this record of achievement and to further develop a more strategic relationship between Ireland and its Diaspora, the Government convened the Global Irish Economic Forum in Farmleigh on 18-20 September. The full report of the Forum is now available on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs, www.dfa.ie.The overall report contains details of the main themes to emerge; the specific initiatives proposed; and the medium term objectives identified. These initiatives are not formally endorsed by Government, but instead reflect the opinions and suggestions advocated by those who participated at Farmleigh. The Government has also decided to establish a new inter-Departmental Committee of senior officials to consider and take forward the work of the Forum. This group will report to Government.The publication of these reports and the establishment of new mechanisms for progressing the proposals made at Farmleigh are clear demonstrations of our determination to build on the success of the Forum and to develop closer links between Ireland and the global Irish.The Government has also established a specific strategy aimed at further enhancing our relationship with the United States and the Irish community resident in that country. The Strategic Review of Ireland's relationship with the US, launched by the Taoiseach last March, made a number of key recommendations which are now being taken forward by a new Ireland US Strategic Policy Group in Dublin, chaired by myself and bringing together key Departments and Agencies in Dublin. The Government has also established a specific strategy aimed at further enhancing our relationship with the United States and the Irish community resident in that country. It also created an Irish-American Leadership Council in the United States to harness the collective organised leadership of Irish America. I was pleased to chair the inaugural meeting of this Council in New York last week during my visit there.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I propose to take Questions Nos. 378 and 379 together.It is standard recognised international practice for a Minister in any government to be met on arrival in a foreign country by their Ambassador or an embassy official, to be accompanied by their embassy throughout the visit and to be seen off by the embassy on their departure. It is also standard practice for the embassy to arrange transport and accommodation for visiting ministerial delegations where this is not provided by the host government. In addition, it is normal practice for an Embassy representative to be present on the ground to assist with transit when a Ministerial delegation arrives at an airport in its country of accreditation en route to a third country. This is particularly so when the transit occurs through the city in which the Embassy is located. These courtesies are universally observed and have been extended to Irish Government Ministers, regardless of party, since the earliest years of the State.It had been the practice over several decades for chauffeur-drive cars to be hired to transport Ministerial delegations where local Embassy vehicles were unavailable or unable to accommodate the delegation. This practice, which had been followed by all Governments going back at least thirty years, was discontinued in February this year, following a decision by the current Government that chauffeur-drive cars should not be hired unless there are compelling business reasons to do so. The Government also decided that in situations where it is necessary to hire vehicles for the transport of Ministerial delegations, people carriers should be used, where this is the cheapest option. I have been in frequent contact with the Secretary General of my Department, in his capacity as Accounting Officer, regarding these matters, including the particular case of Embassy London, and he and senior officers of the Department's Corporate Services Division have communicated the Government's position to all Missions on a number of occasions during the course of this year.A number of communications which issued to Missions since late last year have emphasized the severity of the pressure on the public finances and the consequent need to make savings across the entire Department. The Department's travel and subsistence regulations, most recently revised and re-issued in June 2009, are underpinned by the need to obtain best value for money in respect of expenditure incurred. Missions have been reminded of the need to regularly review their arrangements with regard to locally procured services including chauffeur-drive car hire. Where annual expenditure is likely to be above a certain threshold, Missions are also expected to ensure that Departmental guidelines on procurement are being complied with and that indefinite or open-ended arrangements are not allowed to develop or continue.As regards travel by Ministerial delegations, Missions were earlier this month instructed, where it not already the practice, to ensure that the Ministerial Private Office concerned is provided with a detailed estimate of the nature and likely cost of the local transport, hotel and/or other costs in advance of the visit and to ensure that they receive written confirmation from these offices before any costs are incurred. This will enable Departments and Ministers to be fully aware of the costs of their travel.The London Embassy services a relatively large number of visits by Government Ministers to Britain as well as a significant number of Ministerial transits through London Airports. For well over twenty five years, the Embassy in London had been routinely hired chauffeur-drive cars for Ministerial delegations and those of other senior office holders visiting Britain or transiting British airports. This practice was informed by a number of logistical considerations, including security concerns. For reasons of economy, in January 2009 the Embassy in London purchased a seven-seat vehicle which, together with the official embassy car, is now routinely used for transporting visiting and transiting delegations where required. Even when the annualised cost of the purchase of the second vehicle is taken into account, this measure has generated substantial savings, particularly on chauffeur-drive hire and travel.On foot of the instructions issued earlier this year to all Missions about reducing the use of hired cars and making bookings only on the specific instructions of the other Department or Minister's Office concerned, I anticipate that 2009 will show a dramatic reduction in expenditure on hiring chauffeur-drive cars, in London and elsewhere. The expenditure information requested by the Deputy is given in tabular form.YearCharged to:Taxi fares*Chauffeur-drive carsSelf-drive carsAnnual Totals€€€€2007Department of Foreign Affairs19,594.0381,038.530.00100,632.56Other Departments and offices0.0046,625.150.0046,625.15Totals (€)19,594.03127,663.680.00147,257.712008Department of Foreign Affairs11,419.5845,958.350.0057,377.93Other Departments and offices0.0055,094.950.0055,094.95Totals (€)11,419.58101,053.300.00112,472.88*Taxi costs incurred by embassy staff on official duty.

This means that Ireland will maintain its position as one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis.The Government has established a target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012. Achieving this target will be a challenge in the current economic circumstances. The Government will make a full assessment of our capacity to achieve it in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Budget. Ireland's aid programme is recognised internationally as one of the best in the world. Our peers in the OECD have described it as "cutting edge" and Ireland as a "champion" of aid effectiveness. I can assure the Deputy that this quality will be maintained while we continue to ensure maximum value for taxpayers' money in our aid programme.

The total number of staff in my Department at Principal Officer level or higher is currently 140. Following full implementation of the ISER, the number of staff at Principal Officer level or higher will be 135. This represents 8.5% of the Department's current authorised number (1,577).
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I propose to take Questions Nos. 382 and 383 together.As the Deputy is aware, the Government has been working towards a binding and comprehensive global treaty on the arms trade, covering all weapons and ammunition.    At the United Nations, Ireland has been actively promoting the proposal for an Arms Trade Treaty to secure agreement on common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms. In October 2008 we co-sponsored a resolution at the General Assembly which led to the establishment of a Working Group to consider the elements that might be included in a legally binding Treaty. That Group in turn met in March and July of this year in New York. Officials from my Department played an active role in proceedings, and took the opportunity to explain to other UN Member States both the high priority which Ireland attaches to achieving an Arms Trade Treaty, and the specific elements which we believe it should take account of.Following on from those meetings, Ireland, along with its EU partners, concluded that we should now take the next step in this process and proceed to full negotiations on a Treaty. Currently, the First Committee of the UN General Assembly is considering a resolution to establish a United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty. It is planned that negotiations on a Treaty would be conducted at this Conference in 2012. The Resolution also directs that five preparatory meetings be held prior to the Conference in the period 2010 to 2012.    While this resolution has not yet been finalised, it seems clear that the formal negotiation of a Treaty will begin in 2012. Matters such as the agenda and rules of procedure of the Conference will be considered at the preparatory meetings.    The Deputy can be assured that Ireland will continue to advocate for the strongest possible Arms Trade Treaty, and to work towards that end.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The European Commission concluded a technical agreement with Israel in 2005, whereby Israel agreed to provide proof of origin notes on consignments to the EU, which should enable customs authorities in the EU to distinguish between goods originating in Israel and in settlements, based on the postcodes of the place of origin. I understand that it is in the first instance an obligation on the importer to distinguish between goods entitled to preferential rates of duty and those not so entitled. There are obvious difficulties in ensuring 100% effectiveness of this or any such system in relation to the complex situation in the Occupied Territories. Implementation and enforcement are the responsibility of the competent domestic authorities in each Member State. In Ireland that would be the Revenue Commissioners, the Irish Customs Service and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	472	As the Deputy will be aware from my previous reply to him on 16 September, I am familiar with the case of Dr. Tajbakhsh, who was arrested at his home on 9 July in Iran. Our Embassy in Tehran is continuing to follow his case.Unfortunately, like many of those arrested in the aftermath of the disputed Presidential elections of 12 June, Dr Tajbakhsh's conditions of detention remain unclear. Many hundreds continue to remain in detention in Iran and it is still not clear when, and by what process, these will be released. There appears to be some degree of disarray in the judicial system, with trial dates being set and then re-scheduled and diverging views internally within the regime as to how the protestors should be dealt with. Dr. Tajbakhsh is a US dual citizen and a noted and respected academic who has been accused of being a spy for a western intelligence agency and has had to participate in one of the televised "show trials". He had been arrested before on similar charges. He is therefore a "high-profile" detainee, whose prospects of being released are not helped by the authorities' misrepresentation of the post-election protests as an attempted revolution with international involvement.While it is regrettable that there has been no progress so far in securing his release, I am encouraged by recent reports that Dr Tajbakhsh may have been allowed some limited access to his family, including occasional brief phone calls and supervised visits. Diplomatic efforts, led by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran which handles US interests, are continuing in an effort to secure Dr. Tajbakhsh's release. I understand that the US representatives also took the opportunity to raise directly the cases of all five of their nationals currently detained in Iran, including Dr Tajbakhsh, at the talks with Iran in Geneva on 1 October. It is now to be hoped that Dr Tajbakhsh's case will benefit from the intensive diplomatic engagement which is continuing between the US and Iran and which, so far, appears constructive. However, there are some worrying reports emerging today that Dr Tajbakhsh may have been sentenced to at least 12 years imprisonment. Our embassy in Tehran is following the matter closely.The EU has been vocal in its reaction to the deterioration in human rights generally in Iran since the disputed Presidential elections, with a particular focus on the maltreatment of those in detention and the need for due legal process to prevail. Ireland has strongly associated itself with the serious concerns expressed by the EU regarding the recent deterioration in the human rights situation in Iran. Senior officials of my Department have met with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland on several occasions since the June elections, to convey my strong concerns on these matters to him.The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to bring these matters, and the case of detainees such as Dr. Tajbakhsh, to the attention of the Iranian authorities. We will also avail of the opportunity to express our concerns about the deterioration of human rights in Iran, both nationally and in an EU context, as we did most recently at the Human Rights Council in Geneva last month.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	473	On 11 August, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was sentenced to a further 18 months in detention. She was found guilty of breaking the terms of her house arrest by virtue of the illegal intrusion of a US national into her compound in May.She lodged an appeal against this conviction but, not unexpectedly, the appeal was turned down by judges at a divisional court on 2 October. The appeal will now be taken to a higher court. I have no date on which these proceedings will be completed.As I indicated in a statement on 11 August, and since then in this House, the arrest, trial and conviction of Aung San Suu Kyi on the most spurious of charges further compounds the already bleak situation in Burma, where repression against members of the opposition, the ethnic groups and the population at large continues unabated and human rights and fundamental freedoms are systematically denied. We fear that the sentence indicates the regime's intent to silence Aung San Suu Kyi in the lead-up to the elections they plan to hold next year. These elections will be held on the basis of a discredited new Constitution, which excludes her from running in them.There have been no changes in the situation regarding Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest while her appeal proceedings are underway, but there have been a number of recent developments in Burma which involve her, which I welcome. In the last two weeks, the junta has facilitated two meetings between Aung San Suu Kyi and the Labour Minister, Aung Kyi, who is the official liaison officer between her and the Government. In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi has been permitted, at her request, to meet the Heads of Mission of the Embassies of the United Kingdom (local EU Presidency), the United States and Australia in Rangoon on 9 October.  It would be premature to conclude that these developments represent any substantive change of direction on the part of the regime but we are monitoring the situation carefully. We are also maintaining contact with the United States with a view to following how its new strategy of engagement with the regime is developing and if it seems to be producing any positive results.In the meantime, the European Union will continue to maintain its sanctions against the Burmese regime, sanctions which were strengthened following the conviction of Aung San Suu Kyi. We will also continue to call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners and for the launching of a genuine, inclusive political dialogue in Burma, as we did in Ireland's statement at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 28 September.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	474	There are no state agencies operating under the responsibility of my Department. However, there are currently three bodies; two Advisory Committees and one Educational Commission, which operate under the aegis of my Department. All members serving on these bodies do so in a voluntary capacity and are not in receipt of a salary or fee.The Development Education Advisory Committee was established in 2003 following the recommendations of the Ireland Aid Review Committee. Its purpose is to advise the Minister, the Minister of State and Irish Aid on development education policy.The Government Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (previously known as Díon) was set up in 1984 to advise the Government on the welfare of the Irish community in Britain. The Committee’s primary role is to advise on the distribution of Government support to voluntary agencies providing front line services and community care to Irish people in Britain.The Fulbright Commission (The Board of the Ireland – United States Commission for Educational Exchange) finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have some statutory obligations in regard to this organisation, including the appointment of four members of the eight-member Commission.In addition, theAdvisory Board for Irish Aid (ABIA) was established in August 2002 to provide general oversight and advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State for Overseas Development on the strategic direction of the Government’s programme of assistance to developing countries. The term of the last Board ended on October 31st 2008. The work of the Board was funded by an annual budget allocation under Vote 29 (International Co-operation) of the Department of Foreign Affairs.In respect of the Fulbright Commission, I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, have no statutory role in regard to the management of the Commission. The management of the Fulbright Commission, to which my Department provides an annual grant in aid, enjoys full autonomy of management and administration in accordance with the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991. Accordingly, the question of the travel or entertainment allowances does not arise. Members serving on the Government Emigrant Services Advisory Committee, are entitled to claim for costs of official travel undertaken either attending meetings of the body or when engaged on overseas travel on behalf of the body.  Members serving on the Development Education Advisory Committee and the Advisory Board for Irish Aid may claim for vouched travel and accommodation costs associated with participation in meetings. In the case of the Advisory Board for Irish Aid, members may claim the costs of overseas travel on behalf of the body and subsistence allowances at standard rates. These travel and subsistence costs are paid in accordance with the internal travel guidelines operating in my Department, which are in turn fully compliant with the Department of Finance guidelines on travel.Members of these bodies do not receive entertainment allowances. The budget allocation to the Advisory Board for Irish Aid covered research and administration. This included a number of incidental expenses, including the hosting by the Chairman of a small number of lunches in connection with meetings of the Board.

We have remained in contact with her Spanish and Irish family during this deeply worrying time for them.The Embassy, including the Ambassador, has been in regular contact with the senior police officer leading the investigation and also with senior political representatives, and will continue to do so. The Spanish authorities have undertaken to keep our Embassy informed of developments, which they are treating as a missing persons case, and I can assure you that any information received to-date has and will continue be passed on immediately both to the family in Spain and in Ireland.I am informed that a meeting between the father of the person concerned (accompanied by a consular official) and senior police officers involved in the investigation was facilitated by the Embassy. I am also informed that since the disappearance of the girl that there had been regular contact with her aunt and that she was provided with any information pertaining to the case that was available.I can confirm that I did offer, following a request from her local Councillor, a meeting with the Head of our Consular Division, who is also the contact person for the Spanish based family in this case, and for him to report to me on that meeting. Furthermore, I made clear in my previous reply to you of 13 October that I am willing to meet the family members concerned and I repeat my invitation to them to contact my office on (01) 4082140 to arrange such a meeting. The Deputy should also be aware that we acceded to a request from the Irish family that the aunt mentioned by him would be our contact person in this very sad case. I can assure the Deputy that I have taken a strong interest in this case and I fully understand the acute distress the disappearance of the girl is causing all her extended family.

I also pointed out that the recommendations of the Special Group on Public Sector Numbers and Expenditure Programmes have not been adopted by the Government as policy but rather are proposals for consideration in the context of addressing the current budgetary challenges. I welcome and support the commitment contained in the Renewed Programme for Government relating to the continuation of supports for Irish film making.

Subsequently, the Department brought the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, 2009, which was issued by the Department of Finance and included requirements in relation to expenses, to the attention of all its agencies.In general, the practice to date has been that an agency, hosting a Minister or Minister of State for functions or occasions abroad, would make the necessary travel, accommodation and other arrangements and meet some of the associated costs. Such a practice would also apply, but to a much lesser extent, for home events.  This practice is currently being reviewed, in consultation with the relevant agencies under the aegis of the Department.

On Culture Night, key artistic and cultural organisations, including the National Cultural Institutions, extended their opening hours until late in the evening to allow the public increased free access to the various collections, workshops and other events on offer.Culture Night encourages people of all ages and from all backgrounds to experience a wide range of cultural activities in a relaxed and family friendly manner.  Whilst the attendance figures for the 2009 event are not quantified, initial indications are that the event was a huge success in all the areas.Temple Bar Cultural Trust has been co-ordinating Culture Night in Dublin since its inception in 2006 and my Department has provided an allocation of  €50,000 to the Trust for the 2009 event.  In addition, Temple Bar Cultural Trust provides assistance to the various regional venues with the development and promotion of the national event and will receive a further allocation of €20,000 for this service in 2009.All other participating cities and towns will receive allocations on a matched funding basis subject to a maximum of €10,000 for each location.  The final cost of the regional event is not yet available as participants have until the end of this month to submit claims.   In addition to the sums outlined above, Culture Night in Dublin and Limerick were each allocated an additional €10,000 by my Department for an outreach programme.The above amounts represent my Department's direct cost towards the running of the event.  They do not include the costs of the individual institutions and organisations, which participated in the event, or the value of any sponsorship or contributions in kind received by the Temple Bar Cultural Trust.

Both have a community development element and both are delivered through separate local delivery structures.I have already indicated that my strong view is that a single focussed programme with a single integrated delivery structure is now needed in order to maximise the impact of these two programmes, which serve disadvantaged communities.  My overall aim is to ensure that, from 2010, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focussed programme with clear objectives and simplified and streamlined delivery structures.  The Centre for Effective Services is currently preparing proposals for me in this regard, which will draw on good international practice and independent advice. I hope to receive this in the near future with a view to rolling out a new programme early next year.The community and voluntary sector is represented on the boards of Urban Partnerships/Local Integrated Companies and nomination from that sector and others is subject to compliance with a number of guiding principles and requirements. Information in relation to board membership and nomination is available on the Department's website at www.pobail.ie. Automatic representation for CDPs on the boards of these companies in the context of the roll out of the new programme does not arise at this time.  I should also stress that my Department has no role in the internal operations of community development projects, which are companies limited by guarantee. Management of the companies, including staff matters and redundancy issues, are a matter for the Boards of those private companies.In tandem with the redesign work, my Department is currently undertaking a review of Community Development Projects and will shortly have a full report on the findings and recommendations that arise from that review. While I cannot be specific at this stage about the impact on specific bodies in particular areas, pending the outcome of the review process, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focussed programme with clear objectives and simplified and streamlined delivery structures.

In compliance with the provisions of the Act, all certificates of life events issued by the civil registration service are bi-lingual. This facilitates persons registering a particular life event to do so either in the Irish or English language and these details are included in any certificate subsequently issued in respect of that event.Birth certificates are issued by registrars and the General Register Office in accordance with section 61 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004. All of the standard text on a birth certificate form is bi-lingual with certain exceptions. If an applicant requests a certificate in English, the name of the district of registration, superintendent registrar's district and county is printed in English only. If an applicant requests a certificate in Irish, these items are printed in Irish only.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.While the scheme is free for those who are eligible, all of the transport companies involved, including CIE, are paid for the service by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The estimated cost of the scheme in 2009 is €76.4 million. Any extension of the scheme to include other EU citizens would have considerable cost implications. Given the current economic situation, I have no immediate plans to extend the free travel scheme to British or other EU citizens in the absence of an agreed and appropriately funded EU wide reciprocal arrangement. We will, of course, continue to provide free travel for those who qualify and meet the residency requirements.

This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.Since the 1st April 2009 new claims for Domiciliary Care Allowance have been processed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. In the period 1st April 2009 to 9th October 2009, a total of 2430 applications have been received in the required format, of which 1688 cases have been fully processed.  Of the processed applications, 194 have a medical condition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 28 of which have been deemed eligible for Domiciliary Care Allowance.

The annual cost in 2008 was approx. €2.46 billion and the payment issues now  for children of some 190 nationalities living in Ireland.  Against this background, the control policy for the child benefit scheme has been reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse of the scheme continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result of the review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised.  These include the issue, on a quarterly basis, of certificates to selected groups of customers for completion and return to the Department to confirm that they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of Child Benefit.In the case of non-Irish national recipients who are resident in Ireland with their children, certification  that the children continue to reside here is required – the proof of such residence can be provided via  details of the school or college their child attends or, if the child is not of school-going age,  details of the doctor or crèche they attend.  This information is used to verify that the children are resident in Ireland, and for no other purpose.In the case of EU nationals who are working in Ireland but who have qualified children living in another EU state, certification by their employer of continuing employment is requested.  This review process has initially focused on higher-risk categories of customer and will be expanded to include other customer groups in the future. Customers selected for the reviews have to date been selected  largely from non-Irish nationals in receipt of Child Benefit, both those with children resident in Ireland and those working here whose children are resident outside of Ireland.

It features a more generous means test, which takes account of the specific nature of farming and, unlike jobseeker's allowance, farmers claiming this payment do not need to be available for work outside of the farm in order to qualify.Increases in social welfare rates provided in recent years mean that it is now easier for low income farmers to qualify for support under the scheme. For instance, the personal rate of payment has been increased by €6.50 from €197.80 to €204.30 a week from the beginning of January 2009, while the increase for a qualified adult has been raised by €4.30 from €131.30 to €135.60 a week. Increases for qualified children have also gone up from €24 to €26 a week. This means, for example, that a low income farming family with 3 children can now receive a maximum weekly payment of €417.90, i.e. an increase of €16.80 a week (4.2%), which is ahead of the projected average increase in the Consumer Price Index of 2.5% for 2009.Improvements in the method of assessing earnings from insurable employment, which were introduced in September 2007, provide further gains for families claiming farm assist, where either spouse is also in insurable employment. In addition, a capital disregard of €20,000 in the means assessment has applied since June 2005.  Any further changes to the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.

The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.The operation of this scheme was reviewed in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions, with particular regard being paid to the operative date of the scheme and the use of credits for pension purposes rather than the current system of disregards.  The Government is currently finalising a national pensions framework and any decisions with regard to homemaker's will be made in that context.The person concerned applied for state pension transition in August 2009 and was informed that she did not qualify as she has a yearly average of 11 social insurance contributions whereas a minimum yearly average of 24 is required. It would appear that she is due a disregard of 4 years in respect of homemaking for the period from 1994 to 1998 when her youngest child reached 12 years of age. The application of the disregard would not enable her to qualify for state pension transition. She will be eligible to apply for state pension contributory in 2010 in advance of her 66th birthday in April 2011. The application of the disregard would increase her yearly average to 12. She will be entitled to state pension contributory at 50% of the maximum rate when she reaches age 66.

The person concerned will be informed when arrangements have been made.As regards waiting times, I am advised that the average time taken in 2008 to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks. However, if allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks. Those average processing times replicate those for 2007 notwithstanding the fact there was an increase of 27% in the number of appeals received during 2008. There has been an increase of 39% in the number of appeals received so far this year compared to last year and, having regard to the current volume of appeals awaiting determination, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office earlier this yearSince then, however, four Appeals Officers have retired and I am advised that every effort is being made to have those vacancies filled as a matter of urgency. Furthermore, in the light of the current situation, I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that he is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals. In that regard, since the beginning of the year, appeals are being rigorously vetted with a view to increasing the number of cases which can be determined by way of summary decision as opposed to holding an oral hearing. As a result, the number of oral hearings as a proportion of all appeals has fallen from 62% in 2008 to 58% to date this year. In addition, a number of administrative measures have been taken so as to further simplify, streamline and improve the appeals process. The number of appeals finalised so far this year has increased by 14% over the corresponding period last year.While improving processing times and introducing efficiencies remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, it is necessary at all times, given the quasi-judicial nature of the appeals process, to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	534	The objective of the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) report "National Profiling of the Unemployed in Ireland" is to identify metrics other than duration of unemployment to target additional supports for people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. The report quantifies the relative impact of a range of factors which contribute to long-term unemployment. These factors include low education levels, poor literacy or numeracy, advanced age or a history of unemployment periods in recent years. Accurate and relevant profiling can lead to early, targeted interventions for the prevention of long-term unemployment.This comprehensive study, which also looks at international practice in the area of early intervention and profiling models, will prove very significant in targeting scarce resources at those who are furthest from the labour market. In order to ensure the progression of the profiling initiative, legislative provision for capturing profile data and for its use in selecting claimants for intervention was made in the Social Welfare Pensions Act earlier this year. The Department is examining the other process changes required for the implementation of profiling of the unemployed, such as capturing relevant information at initial claim stage.

A claim for State Pension (Transition) was received from the person concerned on 29 June 2009. He does not qualify for a State Pension (Transition) under his Irish social insurance record as he only has a yearly average of 22 reckonable contributions. The person concerned was informed of this decision on 23 July 2009.Under European Union regulations the insurance records of other member states can be combined with an Irish social insurance record to give entitlement to a proportional or pro-rata pension. As the person concerned worked in England, a copy of his UK social insurance record was requested from the UK authorities on 23 July 2009. A reminder has issued to the UK authorities. On receipt of his UK social insurance record, his entitlement to a pro-rata pension will be examined. The customer will be informed of the outcome.

This disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both a medical examination and a means test. The weekly rate of Disability Allowance payment depends on the amount of weekly means assessed. The legislative provisions regarding Disability Allowance state that means will be assessed from all income, which the claimant or claimant's spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the year following the date of their claim with certain exceptions. Income derived from capital assets, such as savings, is not included in these exceptions, and accordingly is assessable as means for Disability Allowance purposes.The person concerned applied for Disability Allowance on 31 March 2009. The claim was assessed by a Medical Assessor and the applicant was deemed medically suitable for Disability Allowance. In order to assess the person's means he was interviewed by a Social Welfare Inspector on 20 May 2009 and was asked to furnish certain documents. At time of interview the person concerned asked for his claim to be considered from 20 January 2009 the date his illness began. Following the report of the Social Welfare Inspector the person concerned was assessed with weekly means of €122.00 from capital derived as follows:Total Capital  =€93,187.40Up to €50,000 disregarded  =€43,187.40€10,000.00 @ €1 per €1,000€10.00€10,000.00  @ €2 per €1,000€20.00€23,187.40 @ €4 per €1,000€92.00Weekly Means€122.00The applicant has two pension plans which comprise of €91,007 of the capital and as both these plans can be cashed by him as he is over 60 the money is assessable as means.On 19 August 2009 the person concerned was awarded a reduced personal weekly rate of Disability Allowance of €84.30 with effect from 21 January 2009. This is the appropriate rate based on the means assessed. He was also awarded a Fuel Allowance of €20.00 (payable for the fuel season 32 weeks from September 2009 to May 2010) and a Living Alone weekly allowance of €7.70, bringing his total weekly payment is €112. A letter issued to the person concerned when the claim was awarded advising him of this decision and of his right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. This Parliamentary Question has now been accepted as a request for an appeal of this decision on the person's behalf. The Social Welfare Appeals Office will be in direct contact with the person concerned in due course.

The JA claim was awarded and paid for 203 days to 15 September 2009.  His JA claim was suspended on 17 September 2009 as he has not signed since then. The person advised the Local Office that he was moving to London. The person applied for a Back to Education Allowance, Third Level Option to attend London Metropolitan University to study for a degree in Musical Instruments. Full-time undergraduate courses in the United Kingdom and other European Union countries which are recognised for Higher Education Grant purposes may also be considered for the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA). This course is recognised for Higher Education Grant purposes, and may be considered for BTEA.To qualify for the Back to Education Allowance, Third Level Option (TLO) certain qualifying conditions have to be satisfied immediately prior to the commencement of the first year of the course:(a) The person must be at least 21 years of age and(b) Be in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance or Benefit (or certain other payments) for at least 12 months (312 days) for TLO.(c) TLO may be approved at 9 months (234 days), if the person is a participant in the Employment Activation Programme or if the course is approved by the local Facilitator.The application for Back to Education Allowance in the 2009/2010 year was refused as the person had only been paid for 203 days and therefore did not meet the qualifying criteria.

This entitles such a person to limited benefits such as Widow's or Widowers Contributory Pension, Guardians Payment (Contributory), State Pension (Contributory), Maternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit and a Bereavement Grant. From the information provided the person concerned may have an entitlement to Disability Allowance as the person has a long-standing medical condition. Disability Allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged 16 or over and under age 66.This disability must be expected to last for at least one year and is subject to a medical examination, a means test and a habitual residency test. If the Deputy provides details of the person concerned, a Disability Allowance application form will be forwarded to the person. The application form can also be downloaded from the Department's website at www.welfare.ie. When the completed form is received the person's entitlement to Disability Allowance will be investigated and the person will be notified of the decision in due course. If the person satisfies the conditions for receipt of Disability Allowance they will have an entitlement to Free Travel. They may, subject to certain conditions, also have an entitlement to a Free Fuel allowance, a Living Alone allowance, a Television Licence and an Electricity and Telephone allowance. It is open to the person concerned to contact his local Community Welfare Officer in the Health Service Executive, if the person is currently without an income, and the Officer will examine the person's entitlement to a Supplementary Welfare Payment. If the person is subsequently awarded a Disability Allowance the payment of Supplementary Welfare Allowance, if awarded, will cease.

The person concerned applied for a Guardian's Contributory Payment in May this year. As the evidence supplied did not support abandonment of the child by her mother, it was decided that she was not entitled to this payment and the decision was notified to the applicant earlier this month.A parent's committal to prison alone is not considered a sufficient qualifying criterion to satisfy the legislative definition of orphan. Each case is decided based on the individual circumstances. Factors such as the length of incarceration, the previous and continuing level of contact with the child and the level of the parents' involvement in the welfare of the child are among the factors taken into account in determining if the legislative provision relating to abandonment and failure to provide is satisfied. This case is currently the subject of an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Where a child whose parent has been incarcerated is cared for by a person who is in receipt of a social welfare payment (other than a Guardian's payment), an increase for a qualified child may be payable for the child. An application form for an increase for a qualified child will issue shortly.

Nightly parades have historically been conducted in Templemore and Nenagh on Tuesday nights and Thurles on Thursday nights. The delivery of quality training for members of the Reserve is dependent on a number of factors. The military authorities have informed me that, in light of the numbers presenting for training at the above mentioned locations and having regard to the rank and the training differentials of those Reservists, it is not currently possible to deliver quality training, weekly, at all of these locations.To address this situation the military authorities have informed me that they intend to introduce a training centre rotation policy for these Units, whereby training will be conducted for all the Units on Tuesday night in one centre and then rotate the following week to another of the three centres. It is anticipated that this approach will facilitate the achievement of the critical mass of reservists for training purposes and enhance the quality of training. The upcoming Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force will provide an opportunity to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of such alternative approaches to training delivery.

The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by wholetime members of the Defence Forces, members of the Gardaí, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day — in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, there are no proposals to alter the existing arrangements along the lines referred to in the Question.

Having regard to this, and the continued priority which the Government attaches to the schemes, and following an evaluation of the ongoing level of demand for grants, the level of expenditure to date and the capacity of local authorities to process and approve additional applications in the current year, I approved a supplementary allocation of approximately €12.5 million to some 26 local authorities on 12 October, 2009.Over the period 1 January 2009 to 30 September 2009, a total of €48.214 million has been recouped by my Department to local authorities in respect of the Exchequer contribution towards some 7,760 individual grant payments under the various grant measures.A detailed breakdown, by local authority, of the initial and supplementary allocations for 2009, the number of grant payments and the amount recouped is set out in the table.Local AuthorityInitial Allocation 2009*No. of Grant PaymentsAmount Recouped**Supplementary Allocation 2009*€€€Carlow County Council1,357,5001931,034,769.00560,625Cavan County Council1,312,50090778,115.00125,000Clare County Council1,490,0001271,069,564.00663,750Cork County Council6,285,0005484,078,910.00791,250Donegal County Council4,820,0007122,982,461.00Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council2,160,0001841,369,104.00125,000Fingal County Council1,795,0001991,414,497.00663,750Galway County Council2,074,0002831,031,608.00Kerry County Council2,950,0003932,187,277.00663,750Kildare County Council1,870,0002301,436,055.00663,750Kilkenny County Council930,00064600,507.00125,000Laois County Council1,910,0001681,290,333.00157,313Leitrim County Council1,790,0002281,203,234.00Limerick County Council1,640,000160762,426.00Longford County Council727,500105550,420.00523,500Louth County Council2,067,5001761,502,927.00581,250Mayo County Council2,775,8345222,159,861.00663,750Meath County Council1,000,000131798,753.00Monaghan County Council2,177,500109946,214.00North Tipperary County Council1,790,0001501,011,256.00175,000Offaly County Council1,465,00099834,586.00484,313Roscommon County Council1,910,000114723,256.00395,625Sligo County Council560,00087348,507.00663,750South Dublin County Council4,545,0004363,220,442.16125,000South Tipperary County Council1,530,0001251,185,237.00663,750Waterford County Council1,707,50077769,606.00Westmeath County Council1,660,000516,244.00Wexford County Council2,325,0002181,352,211.00663,750Wicklow County Council1,230,000103882,141.00663,750Cork City Council2,112,50070592,008.00663,750Dublin City Council14,400,0001,4058,793,976.00663,750Galway City Council1,270,00016121,114.00Limerick City Council940,000152743,754.00457,500Waterford City Council512,50038191,193.00250,000Sligo Borough Council472,75043231,506.00300,00079,562,5847,76048,214,072.1612,477,626*Overall allocations combining the Exchequer contribution and co-funding provided by local authorities**Payments are in respect of the Exchequer contribution only.The suite of Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability are administered by the local authorities and all matters relating to compliance with the terms and conditions of the schemes, the processing and approval of applications and the payment of grants to individual applicants are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.  Local authorities have discretion in determining the eligibility of works or adaptations for grant assistance, having regard to the particular needs of individual applicants. In order to ensure that the available funding is spent as effectively as possible, local authorities are asked to target the grant assistance at essential works and to prioritise applications on the basis of the medical needs of applicants.My Department continually monitors expenditure by local authorities under the schemes with a view to reallocating the available funding in the event of any savings arising in a particular local authority.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	562	Estimates obtained from local authorities and the Affordable Homes Partnership during the first quarter of 2009 indicated that the number of affordable units on hands nationally was in the region of 3,700. At that time, many of these units were already in process of sale or have since been sold.Local authority Housing Action Plans, which ensure a more holistic and integrated approach to social and affordable housing provision, are reviewed in conjunction with my Department on a regular basis.  The autumn round of review meetings is currently taking place.  The data being supplied by local authorities at those meetings will provide an up to date position regarding affordable units on hands.The provision of affordable housing, including setting of the sale price, is primarily a matter for individual housing authorities. The sale price of an affordable home is determined largely by its cost.  Where authorities consider it appropriate, in the context of reduced open market prices and the continuing need to ensure value for money outcomes, they have the option to further reduce the sale price of any affordable house by further subsidisation utilising Part V moneys, clawback or other internal capital receipts on hands.  Local authorities are best positioned to make judgments in this regard, based on local circumstances.Local authorities have been advised by my Department on options for bringing unsold affordable homes into use, including the options of the temporary transfer of affordable homes for use under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or under the new social leasing arrangements, or in certain limited cases, for transfer to the permanent social housing stock.  Where unsold affordable homes are now being brought into use under the social leasing or Rental Accommodation Schemes, they will be considered again for sale as affordable homes once the lease period expires.It is essential that all State investment in housing support, including through leasing arrangements, complies fully with the "sustainable communities" philosophy at the heart of the Government's housing policy, as outlined in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities . In this context, while my Department has not specified a limit on the number of housing units that can be leased for social housing purposes, a circular and guidance note issued by my Department to housing authorities states that authorities must have regard to the concentration of social housing in a particular development or in the general area where leased properties are proposed. This would include taking account of how much housing has been acquired for social purposes under Part V of the Planning and Development Act.In seeking approval for proposals, authorities must provide details of the overall development concerned and the breakdown of the types of occupancy i.e. market/private housing, affordable housing and social housing. This is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the mixed income, mixed tenure objectives of the overall "sustainable communities" policy and these details are considered by my Department when assessing proposals. Leased properties, because of their broad geographical distribution will facilitate, rather than impede, the widely endorsed aim of supporting the development of mixed-income and mixed-tenure communities. The unacceptable alternative is a return to previously pursued flawed approaches of developing large mono-tenure estates, with all the attendant issues of social, economic and educational disadvantage.Even prior to the introduction of leasing arrangements, the quantum of social housing in any particular development could be influenced by a number of factors. In addition to units delivered under the Part V mechanism, units could also be acquired by local authorities as part of their normal acquisitions programme, where this was considered appropriate, or could be secured through the Rental Accommodation Scheme.My Department will continue to monitor and support local authorities' work to bring unsold affordable homes into use, and will adapt and develop the approaches involved, as necessary, in the evolving housing market and economic climate.

Having consulted the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body, my Department issued a circular letter (Ref. BC 6/2007) to each county manager and local building control authority on 16 August 2007 to bring the issue of pyrite to their notice and to request co-operation in the enforcement of the relevant requirements set out therein.  The circular also brought to their attention a notice issued by Fingal County Council on 26 July 2007 on this matter.Following an intervention from my Department, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) proceeded to publish a new amended Standard Recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work.  The new Standard Recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and it is intended to address the quality standards of new homes and buildings in so far as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.  My Department incorporated this NSAI Standard Recommendation into the relevant Technical Guidance Document (TGD-C) of the Building Regulations.  A copy of the relevant amendment to TGD-C is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.   My Department has also notified local authorities, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Home Builders' Association and other key stakeholders of the provisions of the amended TGD-C. In addition, I am aware that HomeBond has included the amended NSAI Standard Recommendation in its published 6th edition of the House Building Manual.Responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations is a matter for the owner or builder of a building. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is the responsibility of individual Building Control Authorities.I am satisfied that the measures outlined represent an appropriate response by my Department to the issue. The resolution of problems arising between building owners and builders is a matter for the parties concerned, namely, the building owner, the relevant developer, and the builder's insurers. Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client – the housing authority in the case of publicly funded housing — and the builder, enforcement is a civil matter. My Department does not gather statistics relevant to the question.

My Department's approval is required at many of the key stages of advancement of these schemes.  The level of involvement can vary from two to four occasions during the life of the scheme, depending on the nature and value of the scheme.  Approximately 120 to 150 schemes/contracts have been under construction at any one time over the period of the current Water Services Investment Programme.Additional information in relation to progress on individual contracts under this Programme may be obtained from the relevant local authority.

The October 2008 draft Limerick Regeneration Programme/Masterplan is framed in the context of the 2007 national housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities . The draft programme outlines a flexible and evolving plan for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the areas over the next decade. Following finalisation of my Department’s consideration of the draft, the programme will be formally presented to Government in the coming weeks, with associated implementation plans.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	570	I presume the Question refers to the circular issued by my Department in February 2009 setting out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to the overall management of their capital and current accounts.  The Government set a limit of €200 million for the contribution that the local government sector can make to the deterioration in the General Government Balance in any one year.  This is not a new requirement for 2009, but current economic and budgetary considerations require all sectors, including local authorities, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.In order to stay within the overall limit for the General Government Balance, it is necessary for local authorities to manage their finances and to maintain their current and capital accounts broadly in balance for 2009.  Within this general requirement, there is capability for borrowing by local authorities for capital infrastructure.Local authorities are not immune to the effects of the downturn in the economy, and there are pressures on resources at all levels.  However, a local authority is under a statutory obligation to adopt an annual budget providing for the expenditure estimated to be necessary for it to carry out its functions and the income estimated to accrue to it. Local authorities are adjusting their spending proposals throughout the year in light of changes they are experiencing in income levels at local level.  My Department will continue to work in partnership with local authorities to ensure that efficiencies are introduced where possible and that expenditure is prioritised to focus on essential services.

The project received 75% funding from the EU LIFE Programme and my Department has contributed the remaining 25%, with additional technical assistance and expertise being provided by Teagasc.The project was designed to deliver a practical blueprint for the sustainable management of habitats protected under the EU Habitats Directive, by the farmers who own the lands implementing a range of diverse and practical farming measures. The project has been highly successful and is due to come to an end early next year.The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I agreed a Memorandum of Understanding for the practical extension of the pilot into the wider area of the Burren, and he has undertaken to provide €3 million from EU funding, to be spent on core activities by farmers.My Department is considering how best to support the necessary work of evaluation, administration, monitoring and research and expects to contribute €500,000 for this purpose. The precise arrangements will be finalised before the pilot project concludes.

These plans will set out how it is proposed to manage the rivers, lakes, groundwaters and coastal waters covered by the Plan to ensure their protection.  The plans, currently being finalised by the relevant local authorities, will contain a programme of measures to address the water quality issues in the area, including the identification of any necessary waste water infrastructure.

Phase 1 works, which are at construction stage, involve improvement works to the existing waste water infrastructure in the town.The Council has appointed consultants to prepare the Preliminary Report in relation to the Phase 2 works, which will involve an expansion of the treatment plant from its present population equivalent capacity of 7,000 to 16,000, together with extensions to the town's sewer network.  I understand that the Council expects to be in a position to submit this report to my Department for approval in November 2009. In parallel with the preparation of the Preliminary Report, the consultants are also progressing the Environmental Impact Statement. Until the Preliminary Report and the Environmental Impact Statement are completed, it is not possible to determine exactly what works will be carried out under Phase 2.

I am not aware of any agencies under the aegis of my Department hosting a Minister or Minister of State abroad.The agencies have been reminded of the ongoing requirement to adhere to Department of Finance guidelines concerning travel, subsistence and associated expenses.  The Government decision to reduce travel and subsistence rates has been brought to their attention and they were instructed to implement the reduced rates with effect from 5 March 2009.In respect of budgetary controls, the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, which my Department has sent to agencies under its aegis, provides that responsibility for ensuring that management operates effective and efficient internal controls rests with the board of directors or a committee of similar status.  The code requires each State Body to produce as part of its annual reporting and accounts package a statement on the internal financial control which operates within the body.  The statement is signed by the Chairperson and subject to audit review.

All existing scheme approvals under the Initiative for which contracts had not been signed or letters of intent had not issued were withdrawn.However, local authorities were also informed that where they were of the opinion that the continuation of a scheme is necessary for the proper development of an area, it was open to the relevant authority to make a case to the Department by 29 May 2009 for the scheme to progress.  My Department is assessing the responses received, including that from Clare County Council, and the decisions on the schemes to progress will be conveyed to the relevant local authorities as soon as possible.

This is primarily due to technical difficulties and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc).Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e over the telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, satellite and fibre.Details of broadband availability from service providers together with the availability of broadband services in specific areas, including areas in County Cork are available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  I would add that information contained on this website is provided by the service providers.The widespread acceptance of the benefits of broadband has motivated the EU Commission to set aside a portion of European Economic Recovery Package (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.I am also considering how the provision of broadband services to unserved rural premises can be achieved through an appropriate intervention under the European Economic Recovery Package (EERP).  My Department is currently considering options for the design of such a scheme.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in 2010 and conclude it in 2012.  A critical step is to apply and secure State Aid clearance from the European Commission.  Discussions with the European Commission on this have commenced.

When I receive the completed reviews I will consider if a change to the licence fee is warranted.The Broadcasting Act, 2009 provides for a change in the process of reviewing RTÉ performance. Section 124(2) of the Act provides that the newly established Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) shall, on an annual basis, carry out such reviews in the future.  It further provides for the BAI to prepare and submit a report on its findings to the Minister before 30 June each year.  The BAI, on the basis of a review, will recommend to the Minister an annual licence fee modification.  The calculation for this modification will take into account the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and any adjustment recommended by the BAI.

As part of its pre-planning consultation and preparation process for An Bord Pleanála, EirGrid considered three potential routes for the project, and consulted on these routes.  In April 2009 following a review of all project documentation, including consultants' studies, reports, and consultation feedback, EirGrid nominated its final "preferred route" (Route Corridor A) and commenced discussions with landowners. The details of Route Corridor A are available on EirGrid's website (www.eirgrid.com) and I have also asked EirGrid to send these details directly to the Deputy.

It also ensures they are aware of their responsibilities under the Department of Finance guidelines for the Governance of State Bodies.  When developments or amendments to these guidelines arise, the State Bodies are immediately advised of same.

Capital support is available to those installing Biomass fired CHP plants, or CHP plants based on Anaerobic Digestion (or AD), or small scale fossil powered CHP plants. Anaerobic Digestion involves the processing of plant or animal by-products in digesters, allowing the material to breakdown and release methane, which can then be burned in a CHP plant.Since the capital support element of the CHP Programme opened, 80 applications have been received, with 58 approvals to date, amounting to a total commitment value of nearly €5m.  Based on all approved projects the installed capacity of the Capital Investment projects will be 14,562 kW of electricity and 19,937 kW thermal — representing a potential saving of 25,254 tonnes of CO2 per year and annual displaced grid electricity of 77 GWh.  The projects installed to date have a combined capacity of nearly 8MW electrical and almost 12MW of thermal energy, and have drawn down over €1.6m in funding.  To date, 4 grant applications have been made for Biomass CHP, of which 3 were received in the last few months.  One application has also been received for an AD CHP plant.  Of the 4 Biomass applications, 1 has been approved in County Cork (to a value of 1.3 million).  This project is currently under construction.My Department and SEI is also in regular contact with the IBEC CHP Group and directly with individuals in the CHP industry.  Decisions in relation to funding for CHP Programmes in 2010 will be subject to the Estimates process.

SEI is engaged in ongoing general research on the many factors that influence consumer energy behaviour.  The resultant information is used in the design of SEI programmes and campaigns such as Power of One, to advise on and encourage more efficient use of energy that both saves money for consumers and reduces carbon emissions.

All applicants were notified of the outcome of their application at that time.Of the 141 applications that were received by the closing date of 31 July 2009, 106 satisfied the eligibility criteria as set out in the detailed rules of the scheme and were presented to the assessment group for consideration.As the pool of quota available for allocation was limited, the assessment group was required to recommend the applications that best demonstrated a real and long-term commitment to dairying and that also provided the best evidence of a viable and sustainable enterprise. Over the course of three extended days of meetings each application was the subject of a detailed discussion by the group. Unfortunately the named person was not considered by the assessment group to merit a position in the top 70 applications.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	589	On 15 July, the Government approved my plan for a reorganisation of my Department's Local Office Network. The plan involves reducing, from 57 to 16, the number of offices from which the Department will operate District Veterinary, Forestry and Agricultural Environment and Structures support services in the future.  A press release was issued by my Department on 17th July 2009.Improvements in business processes, information technology and communications will allow the Department to provide to our clients such services as those referred to earlier, from the 16 enhanced offices set out in the plan.In relation to the Ballybay office, I can confirm that this office is not one of the 16 enhanced centres. District Veterinary, Agricultural Environment and Structures, and Integrated Controls work from Ballybay and Monaghan town and will be transferred to the regional office in Cavan and such services to farmers will be provided from this and other regional centres. The office in Ballybay will remain as a Department office, as outlined previously.Recently, I announced phase 1 of the implementation of the reorganisation of the local office network.  This involves the establishment of the first four of the new regional offices – in Drumshanbo, Enniscorthy, Navan and Waterford – and the closure of a number of those local offices previously identified for closure.The Ballybay office is not affected by this particular phase of the implementation programme.  My Department is progressing the identification of those activities and services that will be carried out in Ballybay, including those that might be transferred from other local offices to Ballybay.Work is continuing on the next phase of the reorganisation plan which, I expect, will be finalised and announced towards the end of the year.  Following my original announcement in July, the staff of the Department's local offices, including those in Ballybay, were fully briefed, at a series of meetings, as to the reorganisation plan.  As soon as I am in a position to announce details of the Ballybay office, the staff will be the first to be informed.I remain fully committed to the maintenance of the Ballybay office as an integral part of my Department and the retention of the maximum number of Departmental staff.Let me reassure the Deputy that the decision to close some 40 offices of the Department was made only after we had completed a detailed study of the Department's operations at local level. Decisions were made in relation to the overall strategy and against a background of major changes in the Department's operating environment in recent years brought about by the impact of the Single Farm Payment, benefits derived from substantial investment in Information Communications Technology and significant reductions in the incidence of disease.The sudden and significant decline in the public finances since 2008 has required all of us to examine expenditure to identify possible savings and the Deputy will be aware that major changes on the programme side of the Department have been implemented in recent months.  When fully implemented this reorganisation will result in a reduction of some 400 in the number of staff working in my Department and deliver very significant annual savings to the Exchequer.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	590	Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act 1988.  One of the company's principal objects under the Act is to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices.When it was first established in 1989 the company actively engaged in land acquisition for afforestation purposes and expansion of its estate.  In latter years, it has reduced its land acquisition programme for a number of reasons, including reduced availability of land for sale, rising land prices and the company's ineligibility for forestry premiums.  Since 2000, the company has focused on contributing to the afforestation programme through its farm partnership schemes, by providing forestry services to farmers and by promoting forestry investment.While much of Coillte's timber supply is destined for processing, the production of biomass for energy will still be significant for the company. The company is working with the key stakeholders in the market and, in particular, with the bio-energy group under the auspices of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In order to refine its business model and strategy for approaching the market, the company has established a pilot depot in County Mayo.Coillte is also currently seeking to align itself with a leading technology company with demonstrable experience and a proven track record in the larger industrial biomass sector. Accordingly Coillte has sought expressions of interest from companies with experience in the biomass technology sector who wish to work with Coillte to develop a long-term sustainable biomass business.

It is a matter for Teagasc and its Board to prioritise its activities and allocate resources in the delivery of agricultural research and other services having regard to the requirements of the Act establishing Teagasc and in line with Government policy.Teagasc has an extensive Agriculture Research Programme in place covering a broad spectrum of agriculture activities. The Teagasc sub-programme on energy crops and bio-processing is focused on the use of renewable biomass as fuel for engines and boilers, the development of efficient production systems for biomass feedstock and the identification of new non-food market opportunities for Irish grassland. Research in these areas is funded primarily through the Research Stimulus Fund Programme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Under Stimulus Calls in 2005, 2006 and 2007, Teagasc was allocated funding to undertake 10 research projects in the bioenergy area in collaboration with other research institutes.Further development of the bioenergy sector in Ireland is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources who have overall responsibility for energy policy in Ireland. In 2006, a Ministerial Bioenergy Taskforce was established, which oversaw the delivery of a National Bioenergy Action Plan to increase the use of bioenergy in the heat, electricity and transport markets to 2020. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was represented on this Taskforce and is implementing a number of measures in the Action Plan to increase the share of bioenergy derived from the Agriculture and forestry sectors.

The OP was approved by the European Commission in September 2008.The main item of expenditure under the OP relates to the Decommissioning Scheme under which 46 vessels have been decommissioned and €36.6m paid to vessel owners over 2008 and 2009. In total 6,913 GTs and 19,356 kWs have been taken out of the Irish sea-fishing fleet which means a greater share of quotas for those remaining in the industry.Funding is also available under the OP for schemes in relation to the promotion of Environmental Management and Inshore Management. The implementing agency (BIM) has been engaging with the stakeholders during 2009 with a view to launching the Environmental Management Systems Scheme and the Inshore Management Scheme in the fourth quarter of this year.Provision has also been made under the OP in relation to assisting the setting up of Coastal Action Groups to support sustainable development and the improvement of quality of life in eligible fisheries areas. Meetings have taken place with Leader groups and Údarás na Gaeltachta and discussions are taking place on the remit and make up of the National Implementation Board who will oversee the setting up of the Coastal Action Groups. A public call for expression of interest in setting up coastal action groups will be advertised in the fourth quarter of this year.

Almost all of our beef exports are to the high-value European market, while the UK is the largest source of imported product. With regard to pigmeat, the UK is the largest single destination, with trade to the rest of Europe and international markets holding steady. Virtually all our imports come from within the EU with the UK providing the largest share. France accounts for over half of Irish sheepmeat exports with trade in boneless cuts continuing to grow, while our imports are primarily from the UK and New Zealand. Much of our poultry exports are in the form of processed product to the UK with third country markets providing important outlets for specific cuts. EU Member States supply the majority of imports with approximately one-fifth coming from third countries such as Brazil and Thailand.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	603	European marketing standards for fresh fruit and vegetables, which included a requirement to declare origin, were established in the early 1960s within the first Common Organisation of the Market for fruit and vegetables.  It is my understanding that these largely reflected national standards in existence in several member states.  EU beef labelling rules were introduced subsequently in the context of a BSE situation to emphasise traceability and provide information to consumers to boost market confidence.The Commission has indicated that it will bring forward proposals for simplification of marketing standards for agricultural products arising from the Green Paper on EU Food Quality policy, which was published in 2008.  The Commission has in mind the introduction of a common base standard via the Single Common Market Organisation.Meanwhile, Ireland is pursuing harmonised EU rules on origin labelling in the context of a proposed EU regulation on the provision of food information to consumers for which the Department of Health and Children is the lead Department.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The EU does not have EU marketing regulations for pigmeat and sheepmeat.  For poultrymeat, the EU marketing regulations that apply are for unprocessed product, for which the following statutory labelling information is required:(a) use-by date(b) class  (poultrymeat must be graded as Class A or Class B).(c)  in the case of fresh poultrymeat, the total price and the price per weight unit at the retail stage(d) condition (i.e. fresh, frozen or quick-frozen)(e) recommended storage temperature.(f) registered number of the slaughterhouse or cutting plant(g) in the case of poultrymeat imported from third countries, an indication of the country of origin.Apart from the requirement applicable to unprocessed poultrymeat from third countries, EU marketing standards do not oblige country of origin labelling for poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department sought the introduction of national legislation for such labelling but this was not approved by the EU Commission.  The issue is now being pursued in the context of proposed EU legislation on food information.  The Department of Health and Children is the lead department for that proposal.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	611	There has been a decline in the number of mushroom growers from 504 in 2000 to 85 at present.  However, the level of output has remained relatively stable as there has been an increase in the scale of operation of the growers remaining in the business in an effort to reduce unit costs.The mushroom industry like all industries has faced challenges due to sterling volatility.  I am satisfied that ongoing support is being provided to the industry through national and EU schemes.Under the National Development Plan (NDP) Horticulture Programme (2000-2006) my Department prioritised the mushroom sector for grant aid and has paid out grants in excess of €5 million for approved investments of some €14.5 million to 190 applicants during the period 2000-2006, many of which are family farm units.Under the current NDP scheme (2007-2013) my Department has paid out grants of €1.248 million for approved investments of some €3.12 million to 19 applicants in the first round (2008).  In the second round of the scheme 21 applicants have been approved for grant aid of €1.3 million for approved investments of €3.2 million.The EU Producer Organisation (POs) scheme is also a vital support for mushroom growers with 93% of Irish growers in POs at present.  This scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base.  Between 2000 and 2009, a total of €31.5 million was paid to mushroom POs as part of the EU PO scheme.  The reform of the EU's common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables which came into effect on 1 January 2009 identified a strengthened role for POs as the core part of the strategy for improving the competitiveness of the fruit and vegetable sector in the future.  The new measures provide greater flexibility and increased funding for some of the approved actions.

The person named established 24.47 entitlements under the single payment scheme, but these entitlements reverted to the National Reserve, as the person named did not submit an application under the 2005 single payment scheme.  A subsequent appeal of this decision to my Department's Agriculture Appeals Committee proved unsuccessful.  The person named then appealed to the Agriculture Appeals Office and, during an oral hearing, undertook to furnish my Department with medical evidence in support of his claim for force majeure in 2005.  The medical evidence, which was subsequently furnished to my Department on 21 August 2009, was deemed to confirm the claim of the person named for force majeure, on foot of which the 2005 application form, submitted by the person named to my Department on 26 August 2009, was accepted.  However, as the person named had not included a map of the land declared on the application, a letter, requesting an appropriate map, issued on 28 August 2009.The person named lodged the map in question with my Department on 11 September 2009.  Following initial processing, it transpired that some of the land being claimed by the person named had also been claimed by another scheme applicant under the 2005 scheme.  It is necessary, therefore, to establish who had use of the land and, in this regard, both parties are being written to in order to clarify the matter.  When this matter is resolved the 2005 application of the person named can then be further processed.

While all of the 5% of cases selected for ground eligibility inspection have now been inspected and a high level of payment has been achieved under the scheme, processing of a small number of inspection results is currently under way following which payment will issue.  Payment will issue in this case shortly.

It covers capitation, tuition and boarding costs and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the churches concerned.  This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.  I wish to advise the Deputies also that my officials have met representatives from the Secondary Education Committee to discuss future funding arrangements for Protestant schools.In this context, I have expressed my willingness to consider any proposals that might be made to my Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals and sustaining the schools that they wish to attend, particularly those in rural areas.The October budget implemented changes in how all fee-charging schools are treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they are allocated.  With effect from 1 January 2009, teachers in fee-charging schools are allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1, which is a point higher than allocations in non fee-charging post-primary schools.  In view of the challenging economic circumstances that we are facing, I am not in a position to reverse this decision.This decision is justified on the basis that schools which have access to fees as an income source are in a better position to maintain services at a time when the public finances are under such severe pressure.  Fee-charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.I will continue to work with representatives of the Protestant educational sector to ensure that State funding made available to the Protestant community is targeted in the fairest way possible to meet the needs of their children and their schools.

A letter of intent for the project issued to the preferred bidder in July.  This requires the preferred bidder to respond with certain important information.  There is a process of due diligence to be undertaken by County Dublin VEC, as client and the Department, as funding authority before a decision can be made to place a  contract.  It is expected that the VEC will be shortly in a position to make a decision on the award of the contract.Following on from award of the contract, the successful design and build contractor will apply for planning permission to the local authority.  Subject to a successful planning application, it is envisaged that construction of the school will commence shortly afterwards.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2 rating.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.
The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the education partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.In the interim funding is available to schools through various schemes such as the summer works scheme, the emergency works scheme and additional accommodation scheme.  The schools in question received funding under the summer works scheme in 2006 for a complete electrical upgrade of its building.  It also recently completed a boiler replacement and associated works, which was funded under the emergency works scheme 2009.

This project has a band 1.1 rating and includes the provision of an enhanced community facility in conjunction with Fingal County Council.The developed sketch scheme has been received by my Department and in order to avoid unnecessary delays, officials from my Department intend meeting with the school's design team to facilitate clearance of this stage.If the developed sketch scheme is found to be in order, approval will be given to the school to seek planning permission.  The project will proceed to tender as soon as planning permission has been obtained.  As the timeframe for securing planning permission cannot be guaranteed, it is not possible at this time to be certain as to when this project will proceed to construction.  However, assuming that planning permission is granted under the normal conditions, it is intended that the project will be on site at the earliest possible date.

It also includes statistical data for the non VEC schools i.e voluntary secondary schools, community and comprehensive schools on a county by county basis for the same period.The statistics are broken down into the following three categories — Mainstream, Post Leaving Certificate and Core VTOS.  Mainstream includes Junior Certificate, Junior Certificate Schools Programme, Transition Year, Leaving Certificate, Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Leaving Certificate Applied and Repeat Leaving Certificate pupils.As regards the management structure of schools in the various different sectors — secondary schools are privately owned and managed.  The majority of them are conducted by religious communities and the remainder by boards of governors or by individuals.  Vocational schools and community colleges are administered by vocational education committees which are statutory bodies set up under the Vocational Education Act 1930, as amended.  Comprehensive schools are managed by a board of management representative of the diocesan religious authority, the vocational education committee of the area and the Minister for Education and Science.

Four of the unsuccessful applicant schools were subsequently allocated a post by my Department based on their projected enrolment for September 2009.  The appeal board is meeting again on 22 October 2009 to consider additional cases currently being submitted.  It is open to any board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009 and Circular 0015/2009 — Meeting the needs of pupils learning English as an Additional Language.  Both circulars are available on my Department's website.The Appeal Board normally meets in May, June and October each year to consider cases submitted.  Appeals must be submitted to primary allocations section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.  The standard application form is available from primary allocations section or on my Department's website.  The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The report and recommendations for a Traveller education strategy was launched by my colleague the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, in November 2006.  The report covers all aspects of Traveller education from pre-school right through to further and higher education within a lifelong learning context.  The primary aim of the strategy is to ensure a quality, integrated education for Travellers underpinned by the principles of inclusion and mainstreaming with an emphasis on equality and diversity and the adoption of an inter-cultural approach.  This is in line with the Government's recommendations in the National Action Plan Against Racism (NAPAR) (2005).The principle of inclusion is at the core of the current strategy and future provision will focus on the development of more inclusive and inter-cultural school practice and environment through the whole school planning process, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  A key aim of the strategy is to enhance access and education service delivery to Travellers.  Future provision will focus on "individual educational need" rather than "Traveller identity".At present my Department spends some €77 million directly on Traveller education from pre-school through primary, post primary and further and higher education.  Direct supports include some 503 resource teachers at primary level and additional teaching hours at post primary level.  From 1 September 2009 the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was expanded to include responsibility for the Home School Community Liaison Service (HSCL), the School Completion Programme (SCP) and the Visiting Teacher Service (VTS) for Traveller pupils as well as the National Educational Welfare Service.  This expanded remit will bring together the four individual services under one common management team thereby providing for a single, more focused, strategic direction at local, regional and national levels reflecting equally the nature and strength of each of the services.  The underlying  rationale for this new single strategic approach, acknowledging and utilising the combined strengths and capacities of the four services, is to deliver better outcomes for children, families and schools.Under the expanded NEWB almost 700 personnel, including 42 visiting teachers for Travellers, who provide direct supports for Traveller pupils, are deployed throughout the country, including in schools serving disadvantaged communities, to support retention, attendance and participation by providing a range of in-school and out of school supports and by engaging with the salient adults in the lives of these children.  There are no plans to increase the current level of enhanced capitation funding paid to schools in respect of Traveller pupils enrolled

The level of extra teaching support provided in respect of language support to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible pupils enrolled and the associated assessed levels of these pupils' language proficiency.  Under present arrangements which are set out in Department Circular 0015/2009 a school can be allocated up to four language support teachers.  Additional support is also available for those schools which have at least 25% of their total enrolment made up of pupils that require language support.  Such applications for additional language support are dealt with through the staffing appeals process.  99 such applications have to date been considered by the staffing appeals board for the current school year and this resulted in the allocation of 73 additional language support posts to 64 of these schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The Deputy will appreciate that while some costs in the renewed programme for Government can be identified with a degree of certainty the costs of other elements will depend on their precise implementation.  The specific education measures include a commitment to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio for the lifetime of the Government, 500 teaching posts over the next three years, funding for 28 additional psychologist posts, standard capitation grants to schools being maintained and an extra allocation being made available to schools for needs such as book rental schemes and curricular activities.The commitment to maintain the standard capitation grants to schools will not give rise to additional costs except in so far as it relates to increases in the school going population, the costing of which would form part of the annual estimates and budgetary process.  While the precise costs of the additional teaching posts cannot be determined until the actual appointments are made it is anticipated that every teacher appointed will give rise to an initial annual pay cost of some €46,000 on appointment rising to an average of €64,000 over time.  We plan to start allocating the first tranche of 200 posts early in the new year, with a further 150 posts to be allocated in September 2010, with the remainder in September 2011.  Assuming 200 extra teachers from the beginning of next year and a further 150 teachers next September the extra pay costs next year will be in the order of €11 million and the ongoing full year pay cost when all 500 teachers are employed at average salary will be in the order of €32 million.The funding of the additional 28 psychological posts is expected to give rise to an additional full year cost of some €2.3 million.  The exact level of additional funding for schools for the consolidated grants will be considered in the context of the estimates and budgetary process.  The revised programme also provides for other measures which have the potential to give rise to additional costs for the education sector.  These include for example delivery of 100 MBs Broadband for all second level schools by 2012 and roll out of new digital access devices for teachers and students.  In addition it provides for the development of a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the EPSEN Act focusing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs.  However it is not possible to give an exact costing at this early stage until the implementation arrangements are worked out.The funding for the commitments in the renewed programme for Government will be considered in the overall context of the funding available to Government for next year.  We have started the process of preparing budgets for 2010 and all the commitments in the programme for Government will be considered in that context.  At this stage I obviously cannot say what the final position will be until the issues are discussed by Cabinet.

For example, work is ongoing on increasing the use of shared services and shared procurement arrangements.  This is also an issue I will be examining closely in considering the Higher Education Strategy Group report and the future structure and role of the Vocational Education Committees.  It is not easy to find savings when so much of my Budget goes on pay.  It is obviously incumbent on all of us that given the financial situation we deploy staff and other resources in the most effective way across the education sector.  We have started the process of preparing budgets for 2010 and all the commitments in the Programme for Government will be considered in that context.

It is not possible to give a timeframe for publication at present, given that the processes involved will require discussions with the education partners as well as the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children.

The NCSE will continue to allocate teaching and special needs assistant resources in line with my Department's policy to enable schools support pupils with special educational needs.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	636	I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs, including those with an intellectual disability, continues to be a key Government priority.  The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with an intellectual disability, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the  primary and post-primary school network.  There has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years.  There are now about 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs.  This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) — compared with just 300 in 1997.  There are over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools compared with just 2,000 in 1998.  Over 1,000 other teachers support pupils in our special schools.As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in  specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology, equipment as well as the provision of special school transport arrangements.  Planned expenditure levels for my Department is being considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010 and the decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for the Government.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.However, I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs.  The NCSE will continue to allocate teaching and special needs assistant resources in line with my Department's policy to enable schools support pupils with special educational needs.

There are 26 schools with a Protestant ethos in the State, 21 of which charge fees.  No fee-charging school, regardless of denomination, receives direct funding from my Department to cover its running costs.  However, teachers in all fee-charging schools are paid by the State, an arrangement which pre-dated the introduction of free education arrangements.  Teachers are allocated to fee-charging schools at a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1; which is a point higher than in schools in the free education scheme.  Fee-charging schools may continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.  The cost of teachers' salaries in Protestant and Jewish schools amounted to €39.4 million in the 2007/08 school year.  Protestant and Jewish schools also received €1.5 million in capital funding in 2008.My Department disburses the Protestant block grant, which has amounted to €6.5 million in 2009.  It covers capitation, tuition and boarding costs and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the churches concerned.  This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.  The boarding grant element of the block grant is a recognition of the dispersed nature of the Protestant community.  In this regard, I wish to advise the Deputy that students who board at a Protestant school which does not charge fees may also apply for a grant from the Secondary Education Committee to assist with boarding costs.  At present, only one school falls into this category.I, along with my colleagues in Government, recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background can  attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos.  I will continue to work with representatives of the Protestant educational sector to ensure that State funding made available to the Protestant community is targeted in the fairest way possible to meet the needs of their children and their schools.Roll No.SchoolBoarder, based on 07/08 enrolmentsDay, based on 07/08 enrolmentsTotal, based on 07/08 enrolments60090QRathdown School, Glenageary11428640060272WKings Hospital, Palmerstown34435469860320HSt. Columba’s College, Dublin 182306629660381ESutton Park School, Dublin 132826629460640CSandford Park School, Dublin 624824860650FSt Andrew’s College, Booterstown97597560660ISt Patrick’s Cathedral School, Dublin 813013060670LHigh School, Dublin 678978960910FAlexandra College, Milltown15645461061010UWesley College, Ballinteer12075487461080SRoyal School, Cavan5613419061570MKilkenny College47634281862060RBandon Grammar School, Co.

For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or guardians, dependent mature students or as independent mature students.  A mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age in the year of entry to an approved course.  An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding entry to an approved course.When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that parental income must be taken into account.  Independent mature students, on the other hand, are assessed without reference to their parents' income.  The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the candidate only and of his or her spouse where appropriate.  The Student Support Bill will provide the Minister with the power to regulate for different classes of applicants.  This power would enable me, if there are compelling reasons and adequate resources to do so, to consider the circumstances where a student could be assessed without reference to parental income.  Any extension of the provision of assessment as an independent mature student will have to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted at very specific circumstances where students can demonstrate that they have been genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a period before the commencement of their studies.

This is reflected in the fact that my Department was the only Department other than social welfare that got an increase this year.  I assume that the Deputy is referring to my Department's decision earlier this year to suppress a number of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability (MGLD).  I would like to assure the Deputy that there will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a MGLD.  My Department examined the enrolment numbers in these special classes and found that a number of classes did not have the minimum number of 9 pupils required to retain the special class teacher.  Over half of the classes suppressed had five or fewer children.  Schools which had MGLD special classes were allowed to keep them as long as the number of pupils enrolled was 9 or more.The special classes which closed pre-date the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with MGLD as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities.  All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.  All children with MGLD who were in the classes that have been suppressed will be able to receive additional teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the General Allocation Model.The Deputy will also be aware that this Government is committed to the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act.  A significant number of sections of the Act have already been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of  children with special educational needs.  In the renewed programme for Government, the Government has committed to the development, in consultation with stakeholders, of a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the EPSEN Act, focusing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs.In addition, the renewed programme for Government also commits to funding for 28 additional posts for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) to bring the number of NEPS psychologists to 210.  This means that every school in the country will Have access to NEPS which provides assessment and psychological advice for schools to enable them to provide appropriate supports and programmes for children with special educational needs.  I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. The NCSE will continue to allocate teaching and special needs assistant resources in line with my Department's policy to enable schools support pupils with special educational needs.

In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes.  Combined classes are a feature of the majority of schools in the country and this arrangement has no adverse implications for the quality of the education children receive.In terms of class sizes 80% of primary pupils were in classes of less than 30 pupils during the last school year.  With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will inevitably be differences in individual class sizes.  Some schools can have class sizes of greater than 28 but this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its teaching resources in order to have smaller numbers in other classes.  The Deputy will be aware that the renewed programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government.It also states that we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years.  We will immediately start the process of providing 200 posts to those schools most seriously affected by the recent increase in the PTR, using objective criteria which will be agreed in advance in consultation with the education partners, with an appeals process.  A further 150 posts will be created in each of the following years.  My Department proposes to structure a consultation process through meetings with the education partners in the coming weeks in accordance with the commitment to consultation as set out in the renewed programme.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the issues raised by the Deputy pending the outcome of the consultation process.

If the Deputy supplies the names and addresses of the pupils concerned, a report on their eligibility for school transport will be requested from Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department.  The case can be fully considered on receipt of the report.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	651	Planned expenditure levels for my Department will be considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010.  This will include consideration of the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, and the decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for  the Government.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.  There are a range of measures in place in the education sector to promote the teaching of Irish, and include the following:Irish as an essential subject to completion of upper second level education for all students except those with an exemptionAdditional supports for the establishment of GaelscoileannaAdditional allowances to teachers for teaching through Irish and in the GaeltachtCurriculum support services to provide training for teachers at primary and second levelThe work of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta and Scéim na nDearthóirí in providing Irish medium resources for schools, investing almost €2 million p.a. in this areaThe increase in marks for oral assessment in the certificate examinations to 40% to promote a strong emphasis on oral competence in teaching and learningA three-week Gaeltacht placement for trainee primary teachersA scholarship scheme to enable disadvantaged second level students to attend Irish colleges in the GaeltachtSummer camps in Irish for disadvantaged primary studentsContinued monitoring of standards in Irish in our schools through the Inspectorate and through externally commissioned researchInvestment in programmes in Irish in higher education, particularly through Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge, NUI Galway, Fiontar in Dublin City University, and NUI Cork.These actions are designed to strengthen oral competence in Irish in our schools, to ensure that Irish is taught in a way that is interesting and relevant and will promote a positive attitude to the language among our young people.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	652	The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published provisional information on the Department's website about teacher allocations at primary and post-primary level for the 2009/10 school year.  This was done as a first step at improving the level of information in the public domain about changes to the staffing allocations at both primary and post-primary level.  The purpose of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer.  In applying this moratorium generally, teaching and research activities in the education sector have been afforded significant exemptions relative to other areas of public expenditure.  Nonetheless, the sector has to contribute towards overall public sector numbers reductions.The Government is already prioritising the filling of teacher and special needs assistants posts.  When the Government was introducing the moratorium in the public sector earlier this year I secured a special arrangement for education which ensured we could fill teacher and SNA posts.  The concession also provides for the filling of principal and deputy principal posts in all schools and the first allocation of posts of responsibility in new schools.With regard to staffing at third level, numbers employed fluctuate as recruitment by the higher education institutions occurs throughout the year.  Therefore, the final position on the numbers employed in 2009 compared to 2008 will not be available until early 2010 when returns are made by the institutions.  In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an employment control framework be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued oversight by my Department and the Department of Finance.  This framework allows flexibility around recruitment into posts that are considered essential to maintaining core teaching and research activities, subject to an overall ceiling on numbers employed.The Government is anxious to work with the publicly funded higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary strategy.  The employment control framework aims to enable this while providing sufficient flexibility for the protection of frontline teaching and research activities.  The renewed programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government.  It also states that we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years.  My Department proposes to structure a consultation process through meetings with the education partners in the coming weeks in accordance with the commitment to consultation as set out in the renewed programme.

However, taking as a baseline the latest staffing figures available at end-September, 2009, the numbers of officers at Principal Officer level and higher (72 or 71.2 whole time equivalent) is approximately 5.5% of total staff in my Department (1307.16 wte).  On the basis of the current numbers of applications on hand for the ISER it is expected that the numbers of officers at Principal Officer level and higher will be (68 or 67.6 wte) or approximately 5.3% of total staff in my Department (1286.66 wte — based on end September staffing numbers minus ISER applications approved or currently being considered) following implementation of the ISER.As well as all administrative staff, the above figures also include non-administrative/professional grades e.g. staff of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and of the Inspectorate.  In addition to the ISER it should be noted that this percentage will be affected by other significant reductions in staffing numbers which will occur for a variety of reasons including all other retirements, the Incentivised Career Break Scheme, the levy to provide staff to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the moratorium on recruitment.

It is currently anticipated that there will be a saving of at least €14 million in expenditure on rental temporary accommodation in 2009, compared to 2008.  This clearly demonstrates the efforts being made by my Department to reduce spending in this area.My Department has engaged a specialist firm to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  Work is well under way and the firm of specialists is working closely with officials in the planning and building unit of my Department.  The review incorporates the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.  The work also involves negotiations with prefab suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts or reductions in annual rent, as appropriate.  Progress has been made in all areas of the review.An initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts.  A considerable number of meetings have taken place between the firm of specialists engaged by my Department for this task and the prefabricated accommodation suppliers.  It is expected that negotiations will be concluded  shortly on a number of these.  My Department will then make decisions on the most appropriate way to proceed in each case.

Of this, just under €614m is in respect of primary and post-primary schools and just under €200m is in respect of the third level sector.In respect of third level sector capital, at the end of September a total of almost €115m had been expended from a total allocation of just under €200m. I am confident that the entire remaining sum of €67m will be fully expended between now and the end of the year.On the schools' capital side, expenditure to the end of September was €321.3m, which is almost €92m below the anticipated figure.The main area where expenditure is less than anticipated is on Primary and Post-Primary major capital projects. These projects comprise new schools and major extension and refurbishment projects.The main reason that expenditure is less than originally anticipated on the major schools capital projects is that my announced programme of 78 projects to commence construction in 2009 has been slower to get started on site than initially expected. Another significant factor is that tenders obtained for this programme are yielding a reduction of up to 30% as compared to prices at the height of the construction boom. I have always put a very high priority on the achievement of value for money in capital projects and I welcome this reduction in tender prices.It should be noted that any saving in 2009 relating to the later than expected commencement on site of any major project is a deferred or delayed commitment.  This commitment will now arise in 2010. The rolling multi-annual capital envelope framework allows for the carry-forward into the following year of up to 10% of the annual capital budget and my Department will be engaging with the Department of Finance in this regard.There is a significant amount of capital expenditure planned for the remainder of the year.I will continue to monitor the overall position carefully and will consider, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, the options regarding any capital savings. These options include the option to carry forward to 2010 deferred expenditure commitments.

I invited the IVEA and other interested parties to make written submissions if they wished that I would consider in finalising proposals.Furthermore the Programme for Government includes a specific commitment to develop proposals for the reorganisation of the number of Vocational Education Committees.The Deputy will appreciate that in advance of bringing the matter before Government, which I expect to do in the coming period, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any particular element of the reorganisation.

A site has been purchased for the provision of a new school building.My Department is now in the process of identifying what school projects are eligible for consideration for inclusion in the 4th bundle of PPP schools which  I intend announcing as quickly as possible and the school in question is being considered in that context.The nature of procurement via Public Private Partnership is that a Bundle of school projects is offered to the market together. The other issues which have to be considered in the timing and bundling of schools include outline planning permission being secured, geographical spread and the total committed cost of the proposed bundle.The indicative timeframe for the delivery of a Bundle of Public Private Partnership schools currently stands at approximately four years for the date the Bundle is announced.

Responsibility for funding decisions in relation to such programmes is a matter for Fáilte Ireland and I have no role in the matter.  My Department's student grant schemes are fully means tested and therefore cannot replace Fáilte Ireland's scheme of attendance-based grants.The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the scheme, an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.  Fáilte Ireland courses do not comply with the terms of the Higher Education Grants Scheme and there are no plans at present to extend the scope of the maintenance grant schemes to such courses.I understand that discussions are currently ongoing between Fáilte Ireland,  Institutes of Technology Ireland and the Higher Education Authority in relation  to the future management and administration of these programmes and the levels of award to be made to participants.

The school authority will pay a local contribution of the balance of 5% subject to a maximum local contribution of €3175 in the financial year January to December.Payment of this rental grant-aid is made only when school authorities submit original invoices from accommodation providers to my Department.  The Deputy should be aware that the onus is on the school authorities to submit these invoices to my Department for payment.There are currently 3 schools that have yet to submit invoices for rental grant aid for the January-June 2009 period.  Officials in the Planning and Building  Unit of my Department have been in contact with these schools on a number of occasions.  When invoices have been submitted to my Department, payment will issue immediately.

This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in a total of 42 locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. The locations involved include the area to which the Deputy refers.Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/2015.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	680	The Report of the Special Committee on the Arts and Education: Points of Alignment was published in 2008 by the Arts Council. Its terms of reference required the committee to take specific account of the fact "that the budgetary resources likely to be available over the next 4 years to the Minister for Education and Science for development of services in the education sector must be allocated to fund existing commitments."   Since then the budgetary situation has deteriorated significantly, and there is  an imperative to reduce public expenditure in the years ahead.Chapter 5 of the Report sets out costings for the measures proposed at €3.605m initially per annum, rising to €6.505m.The arts have a key role to play in our education system, in providing for  sensory, emotional, intellectual and creative enrichment and contributing to  young people's holistic development and self esteem. The arts help children to respond creatively, to express feelings, attitudes and to interact with others, as well as inculcating an appreciation of beauty and art.  They support the development of communication, co-ordination, numeracy, creative skills, social skills, team work and leadership skills, as well as promoting a child's self esteem and enjoyment of learning. They also provide an important vehicle for personal enrichment and cultural expression, as well as creating awareness and respect for other cultures.My Department invests extensively in arts education through the provision of  visual arts, music and drama in the primary curriculum, the Music, Art Craft and Design syllabi at second level, through arts education initiatives for disadvantaged pupils, the provision of some 93 additional full time equivalent  teaching posts to VECs for music education, 2 pilot Music Networks initiatives,  and through an extensive range of programmes at Post Leaving Certificate and  Higher Education levels. The Arts also feature prominently in other subjects  such as languages and technology. More recently, in co-operation with Music  Network and the Arts Council, and with significant donations from U2 and the   Ireland Funds, I have announced a major expansion of music education for young people. This will provide for national expansion of music education  partnerships over the years ahead.The Points of Alignment report highlights the importance of supporting arts in  education practice through systematic collaboration between schools and local  artists and through visits by schools to arts events and performances. My  Department is working closely with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to  explore how best a synergy can be promoted between in-school activity and the  work of other agencies, and how best combined investment can be used to optimum effect within available resources.

There is a diverse range of courses relevant to the computer game industry available in the further and higher education sectors in Ireland. A number of dedicated courses are available in computer games development and many broader ICT and engineering courses also contain relevant skills training. Information on all relevant courses is available on the Qualifax website www.qualifax.ie.The Higher Education Authority (HEA) is funding a number of awareness initiatives to promote ICT courses to prospective students and the HEA continues to provide funding to third level institutions, both to improve the attractiveness of existing ICT courses and to set up new ones.2,500 new places were made available this year to enable unemployed persons  pursue undergraduate and postgraduate courses on a part-time basis in areas identified by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs as being relevant to the skills need of the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector.  Places on a number of ICT programmes, including a multimedia and computer  games development course, were approved under this scheme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	682	It is my belief that a well planned Physical Education programme has a vitally important role to play in a broad and balanced curriculum for our primary and second level students.At primary level, Physical Education is one of seven curriculum areas within the revised Primary School Curriculum which was introduced in 1999. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. The curriculum has been structured so as to allow individual schools a high degree of flexibility and choice in the planning of a broad and balanced Physical Education programme for pupils, and includes six broad strands featuring Athletics, Dance, Gymnastics, Games, Outdoor and adventure activities and Aquatics. A programme of in-service training in PE has been provided to support the full implementation of the curriculum. In addition to implementing the curriculum, schools are also encouraged to devote one day every year to "Sport for All" whereby an entire day is given over to sporting activities that emphasise participation and co-operation, rather than winning or losing.In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable. The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.The phasing in of a revised Physical Education syllabus (non-examination) at  Junior Cycle level commenced in September 2003. The Junior Cycle Physical  Education Support Service has been in place since then to support teachers in  the implementation of this syllabus. The programme includes adventure activities, aquatics, athletics, dance, invasion games, net and fielding games, gymnastics and health related activity.Apart from the formal curricula, schools take a range of measures to encourage  physical activity among students during the school day and many provide extensive, broad-based programmes of co-curricular physical activities that are highly rewarding for both pupils and teachers alike. In particular, schools play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for such participation.The Physical Education curricula at both primary and second level have been  developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary.  Consequently, they offer a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it.So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we  are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed,  the second ‘State of the Nation's Children' report launched recently by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking first across the 41 participating countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	683	In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second-level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable. The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.A revised syllabus in Physical Education as a non-examinable subject at junior  cycle was implemented, phased over a 3 year period, beginning in 2003, supported by a comprehensive programme of professional development for teachers. No date was agreed for implementation at senior cycle, and issues  concerning the inclusion of PE as an examination subject at Leaving Certificate  level remain to be addressed. In the meantime, the Council made proposals for a  fundamental re-structuring of senior cycle into subjects, short courses and transition units. The proposals included the provision of PE as a subject, and the inclusion of a short course in Sports Studies. It was considered that the inclusion of PE as both a subject and Sports Studies short course could only be examined within the broader context of plans for senior cycle reform generally.The Council has continued to undertake further analysis and development work  with schools on the issue of senior cycle reform. It currently has a specialist committee working on a syllabus for Leaving Certificate Physical Education.  When revised proposals are submitted to my Department, the implementation  implications will be examined in the context of the overall priorities and resources available to the education sector at that stage.This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities. In a  new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design, and new PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats  are funded as part of any major building programme.A special PE funding package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools in 2007, providing a grant of €4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment. This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we  are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed,  the second ‘State of the Nation's Children' report launched by the Minister for  Children and Youth Affairs found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking first across the 41 participating countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.

This application must be supported by an Occupational Therapist's Report confirming the need for the item(s) in question.It is open to all schools, including Special Schools such as the one to which the Deputy refers, to submit such applications on an ongoing basis as required.  These applications are assessed and approved as appropriate. The school referred to by the Deputy has submitted several applications for specialist furniture and equipment recently, the majority of which have been approved for funding. I can assure the Deputy that any further applications which may be submitted by the school will be dealt with without delay.

Under the revised programme we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years. My Department will be consulting with the education partners in relation to the allocation of these additional posts.Given the current financial situation the country faces, it is imperative that we deploy staff and other resources in the most effective way across the education sector.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	689	I propose to take Questions Nos. 650 to 652, inclusive, and 655 to 657, inclusive, together.I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority. This is reflected in the fact that my Department was the only Department other than Social Welfare that got an increase this year.The Deputy will be aware that the Renewed Programme for Government commits to the expansion in the number of psychologists employed directly by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS). This will allow for the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to every primary and post-primary school in the country and for the deepening of support therein with particular emphasis on special needs units, classes and special schools.With regard to enhancing speech therapy services, I would like to advise the  Deputy that additional funding of €10m was allocated to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for 125 additional therapy posts in disability and mental health services in the 2009 Budget. €7.2 million of this funding will provide for 90 additional therapy posts in the disability services area. These posts will be targeted at supporting children of school going age and will include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists.The HSE will continue to work with funded specialist providers and in co-operation with the education sector to address the health related needs of children with special educational needs in the context of the resources available.The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network. There has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years. There are now about 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) — compared with just 300 in 1997. There are over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools compared with just 2,000 in 1998. Over 1,000 other teachers support pupils in our special schools.As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and  SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment.In relation to autism specific provision, the Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 370 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools, an increase of 40 in the last year.An initiative in November 2006 expanded the level of administrative support available to large schools and schools with high numbers of special classes or a specialist autism unit. The measures included the allocation of additional teachers to allow deputy principals in mainstream schools that, in addition to their ordinary mainstream class teachers, also have five or more special classes for children with the more complex, low incidence, special needs, to operate as administrative deputy principals. Where a school has a principal and four or five mainstream class teachers and also has a specialist autism unit established under approval of NCSE, the principal will be appointed on an administrative basis.My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic ommunication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The SESS facilitates a partnership approach involving support teams of practising teachers, Education Centres, the Inspectorate, the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the National Council for Special Education, Third Level Colleges, Health Board Personnel, Teacher Unions and other relevant bodies and services.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs  Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special needs resources to schools to  support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my  Department's criteria in allocating such support. The NCSE will continue to  support schools, parents, children and teachers and special needs assistants  will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs in line with  my Department's policy.I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. I intend to build on the progress that has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase in resources for special needs.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	691	The Deputy will appreciate that while some costs in the Renewed Programme for Government can be identified with a degree of certainty the costs of other elements will depend on their precise implementation. The specific education measures include a commitment to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio  for the lifetime of the Government, 500 teaching posts over the next three years, funding for 28 additional psychologist posts, standard capitation grants to schools being maintained and an extra allocation being made available to schools for needs such as book rental schemes and curricular activities.The commitment to maintain the standard capitation grants to schools will not give rise to additional costs except in so far as it relates to increases in the school going population, the costing of which would form part of the annual estimates and budgetary process. While the precise costs of the additional teaching posts cannot be determined until the actual appointments are made it  is anticipated that every teacher appointed will give rise to an initial annual pay cost of approximately €46,000 on appointment rising to an average of €64,000 over time. We plan to start allocating the first tranche of 200 posts early in the new year, with a further 150 posts to be allocated in September 2010, with the remainder in September 2011. Assuming 200 extra teachers from the beginning of next year and a further 150 teachers next September the extra pay costs next year will be in the order of €11 million and the ongoing full year pay cost when all 500 teachers are employed at average salary will be in the order of €32 million.The funding of the additional 28 psychological posts is expected to give rise to an additional full year cost of approximately €2.3m.  The exact level of additional funding for schools for the consolidated grants will be considered in the context of the estimates and budgetary process.The Revised Programme also provides for other measures which have the potential to give rise to additional costs for the education sector. These include for example delivery of 100 MBs Broadband for all second level schools by 2012 and roll out of new digital access devices for teachers and students. In addition it provides for the development of a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the EPSEN Act focusing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs. However it is not possible to give an exact costing at this early stage until the implementation arrangements are worked out.The funding for the commitments in the renewed Programme for Government will be considered in the overall context of the funding available to Government for next year. We have started the process of preparing budgets for 2010 and all the commitments in the Programme for Government will be considered in that context.

Under the revised programme we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years.  These posts will be allocated to the schools that are most seriously affected by the recent increase in the PTR, using objective criteria which will be agreed in advance in consultation with the education partners.From an educational perspective it is important to note that numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor — far and above anything else — in improving educational outcomes for children.It is more important than ever that we ensure that whatever teaching resources the Government can afford in these unprecedented economic times are used to maximum effect so as to achieve the best possible outcomes for children.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	693	Details of the expenditure adjustments made to the Education Vote in the context of budget 2009 (October 2008) and the 2009 Supplementary Budget (April, 2009) were made available at that time. Copies of the documents that issued are available to the Deputy.The renewed programme for Government provides for a number of specific measures in the education sector including a commitment to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio for the lifetime of the Government, 500 teaching posts over the next three years, funding for 28 additional psychologist posts, standard capitation grants to schools being maintained and an extra allocation being made available to schools for needs such as book rental schemes and curricular activities.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	694	The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. The Government took these decisions to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.In this respect education expenditure, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. I fully accept that while these decisions were not of themselves desirable they were necessary in securing the future economic stability of the country.As is the case with the finalisation of the Estimates and budget each year, these decisions were taken following careful consideration of all the relevant issues by the Government.I am pleased that the revised programme for Government emphasises the continued priority of education investment in the overall context of the Estimates and budgetary process.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	695	I propose to take Questions Nos. 661 and 662 together.Pupil Teacher Ratio in respect of all schools is currently only available at national level and is not disaggregated by school or any other variable. The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains information relating to class size in primary schools for the school years 2006/07 to 2008/09. The primary census for the current school year is under way and the final outcome will be made available when this process is completed. This information is not available at post-primary level.The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published provisional information on the Department's website about teacher allocations for the 2009/10 school year. This was done as a first step at improving the level of information in the public domain about changes to the staffing allocations at both primary and post-primary level. The allocation process will not reach  finality until later this year and I remain committed to publishing updated information.The renewed programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government. Under the revised programme we will provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years.These posts will be allocated to the schools that are most seriously affected by the recent increase in the PTR, using objective criteria which will be agreed in advance in consultation with the education partners.My Department proposes to structure a consultation process through meetings with the education partners in the coming weeks in accordance with the commitment to consultation as set out in the renewed programme. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the issues raised by the Deputy pending the outcome of the consultation process.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.The Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be needed at primary and post-primary levels for future years.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.Having considered these factors, decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area, including the area to which the Deputy refers.In the meantime, it is open to school authorities to apply for temporary accommodation to meet urgent needs for additional accommodation.
