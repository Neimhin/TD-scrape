All freedom of information applications received in my Department are processed by statutorily designated officials in accordance with the 1997 and 2003 Acts and, in accordance with those statutes, I have no role in regard to processing individual applications.October 2002October 2003October 2004October 2005October 2006No. of applications13212163Revenue generated€125.70*€30.00**€135.00**€195.00**€45.00***Search & retrieval fees.**Application fees (introduced 7 July 2003).
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I have three questions.  First, what type of requests are made to the Department of the Taoiseach under the Freedom of Information Act?  While I do not want to know individual details, what is the nature of such requests?Second, as I understand it, the Freedom of Information Act does not apply to the six North-South Implementation Bodies under the Good Friday Agreement.  As the Taoiseach is aware, that deals with Tourism Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, Waterways Ireland and Foras na Gaeilge, with which no issue of national security is involved.  As the Taoiseach rightly pointed out in England yesterday, we face the opportunity and challenge of a future of developing the island of Ireland.  Those four areas are central to economic development, North and South, and they are not——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I know that, but the Taoiseach is in charge in respect of the Good Friday Agreement.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	6	No, Deputy.  There are five questions, all of which refer to the Department of the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The Good Friday Agreement is the responsibility of the Taoiseach.

He has the support of all of the House in——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The legislation is the responsibility of another Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I understand that.  However, these are North-South issues which deal with four particular items.My third point is one I have raised previously.  The Information Commissioner referred in her report to the fact that under consumer legislation the cost of goods that are proven to be defective is refunded to the consumer.  She went on to state that similar rules should apply to freedom of information fees which apply in the Department of the Taoiseach.  If a public body at internal review overturns an earlier decision by the same public body, it seems iniquitous that the requester must pay an additional €75 to which he or she was entitled from the outset.  In the case of an appeal to the Department of the Taoiseach, if the freedom of information officer refuses a request which is then granted on appeal, does the Taoiseach not think it would be logical and good manners, to say the least, in view of the falling numbers of applications for information to repay the initial amount in respect of information to which the person would have been entitled in the first place?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Deputy asked a number of questions about the type of applications which are made.  A majority of the applications received by the Department of the Taoiseach comes from journalists.  The second biggest percentage of applications comes from members of the public.  Very few sections in the Department are excluded under the legislation.  The last examination by the joint committee of the non-disclosure provisions under section 32 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 related to two areas of legislation.  It was recommended that section 8(4) of the National Archives Act 1986 be included in the Freedom of Information Act and that Part V — sections 32 to 35, inclusive — of the Statistics Act 1993 continue to be excluded from the Act.  In her report, the Information Commissioner indicated that she agrees with the recommendations.  They are the only two that are excluded.  All of the other legislative areas in the Acts are covered.The Department of the Taoiseach has received almost 1,200 freedom of information requests to date.  Just 98 requests have been received for internal review.  Approximately 1% of that has been investigated by the Information Commissioner.  A small number of Acts are referred to the Information Commissioner.  A sum of money is paid during the Information Commissioner process.  The Information Commissioner produces a provisional report in the first instance.  In the provisional report, one can more or less see what the answer is going to be.  One can still claim a refund at that stage.  There are no difficulties in cases in which people want to claim back the money.  Difficulties arise only in the small number of cases which go the entire way.  It is a quasi-judicial process.  Such cases involve a large amount of expenditure.  It is estimated that each ordinary freedom of information case involves costs of just €475.  Cases which go to the Information Commission are far more costly.

Have any such cases been experienced by the Department of the Taoiseach, in one or more such instances?  Can the Taoiseach tell the House whether the Department independently seeks references from previous employers?  Would the Department release pertinent information under the Freedom of Information Act in respect of an applicant for a job about whom an adverse point had been made?  Would the Department have acted differently and in line with the Information Commissioner's ruling?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Do I understand correctly that the Deputy is referring to personal information about an individual?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Yes.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	20	There is no restriction under the Act on the transmission of personal information about an individual.  There is no cost in such circumstances.  If an individual wants to find out what is in a former civil servant's file in the Department of the Taoiseach, for example, he or she is entitled to access that information.  There are no restrictions in that regard, to the best of my knowledge.  Sometimes there can be security restrictions, but I do not think that has happened in my Department.  Normally, the information would be given to an individual.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Last October, the Taoiseach said that consideration was being given to extending the terms of the Freedom of Information Act to the Law Reform Commission.  Can he give an update today on that consideration?  What impact will the proposed Privacy Bill 2006 have on freedom of information legislation in his Department?  I refer in particular to section 13 of the Bill, where a court injunction could prevent information being published.The Information Commissioner revealed that there were 447 freedom of information appeals in 2005.  Did any of those appeals relate to the Taoiseach's Department?  If they did, what was their nature?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	22	In 2006, an additional 130 bodies and groups were brought within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act.  The bodies under the aegis of my Department, with the exception of the Law Reform Commission, are already within the scope of the Act.  The question of extending the freedom of information legislation to the Law Reform Commission is currently under consideration.  There has been no decision yet.  I understand that the situation has been discussed with the commission's chairperson and that it is a question of figuring out the extent of the Law Reform Commission's remit that can come under the freedom of information framework.  Much of its work would not be crucial and could come under it, but other aspects might be different.Of the 447 appeals that went to the appeals commissioner, the figure for my Department is very small, if there were any at all.  There is none mentioned in my briefing note.  There have certainly been no appeals in the most recent period.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Will the Privacy Bill impact on the Taoiseach's Department?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	24	No.  All of the agencies under my Department are covered.  I do not think it would make any difference, with the exception of the National Archives Act 1986.  Section 8(4) of that Act is the only section we withheld and it is the only section that would cause difficulty.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Is it not the case that, whatever the motivation, the legislation passed in 2003 has acted as a deterrent to interested members of the public exercising their right to obtain information?  Is that not the view of the Information Commissioner?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the extension of the remit of the legislation to the Garda Síochána could be an important element in——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	26	That does not arise in this question.  The question refers specifically to the Taoiseach's Department.  In fairness to other Deputies, I ask Deputy Rabbitte to stay within the rules.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  The measure of this question time under your strict ferule, sir, means we would be as well off staying at home.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I am interpreting the rules as my predecessors have done for many years.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Maybe we could e-mail the questions to you beforehand and not bother coming in at all.  You could then send the answers home to us.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I ask the Deputy to obey the rules like everyone else.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I will finish with Deputy Sargent's question.  Over 1% have been investigated by the Information Commissioner since the Act was introduced almost nine years ago.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Was that in the Department of the Taoiseach?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Yes, in my Department.  That is 1% of the 1,200 that happened in the period.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled on other agencies.On Deputy Rabbitte's question, while there was a slight decrease for a while in the number of requests in my Department, they went back up again.  There was an increase of about 30% last year.  There was a slowdown in the use of the legislation for a considerable period, but that has gone back up again.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, together.In 1996, at the request of the then Attorney General, his office took on the task of preparing an electronic Irish Statute Book, eISB.  The first release in CD-ROM format was in December 1998 in respect of the Acts for 1922 to 1997.  Since then, the office arranged for the publication of the eISB on the Internet in September 2000, updating of the Internet site on three occasions and the publication of an updated CD-ROM version on two further occasions.  The more recent updating included Acts, statutory instruments and chronological tables.In August 2006, the office published the latest update to the Internet version comprising the Acts to the end of 2005, statutory instruments to No. 350 of 2005 and chronological tables to the statutes to the end of 2004.  During the update process, the eISB project team established that a systematic error had occurred on a selection of the data contained in the Acts and statutory instruments for the period 1922 to 1998.  This data error was caused by the insertion of hyperlinks, or direct clickable links to referenced parts of an Act or statutory instrument, during the process of publishing the CD-ROM version of the eISB in 1999 which caused some data to be overwritten.  No such data errors have been located in post-1998 data.The original contractor, Juta Publishing Limited of South Africa, was contacted and requested to furnish an explanation as to the nature and precise cause of the data error.  This was received by the Office of the Attorney General.After the problem came to light, the Office of the Attorney General arranged for an additional disclaimer to be added to the eISB Internet site explaining the data error problem and setting out two examples of the error.  Relevant e-mail circulation lists were sent details of the data error and a notice was published in the Law Gazette and Bar Review publications.  Other organisations that may have used the eISB data for 1922 to 1998 as a source of legislation were also informed.The office discussed the provision of a solution internally as well as requesting CMOD to investigate and provide recommendations as to potential solutions.The office sought submissions from external legal publishing companies to advise on the feasibility and costs involved in the application of the CMOD recommendations or on suitable alternative options to providing a solution to the data error problem.  Expert advice is also being sought on the provision of best practices to ensure data accuracy and verification during the production process for publishing legislation.  The office expects to engage a publishing company shortly and the explanation provided by Juta Publishing Limited, as referred to, will be made available to assist that process.  It is expected that a report will be available from the publishing company by the end of January 2007.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	35	It is interesting to return to this issue following the questions last November when, it is fair to say, the Taoiseach did not really appreciate the scale of the problem we had at the time.  I am glad of his reply to the effect that some action has been undertaken.  However, the issue really is whether the Taoiseach accepts we still have a problem if the on-line version of legislation in the Irish Statute Book is not dependable and people need to consult hard copy to get the verifiable version.Does the Taoiseach accept this indicates that much money is being spent at present on a system that is not useable?  This amounts to considerable wastage of taxpayers' money.  This is not the first time Members have discussed the waste of taxpayers' money with regard to electronic communication matters.  Can an end be seen to this debacle?The Taoiseach mentioned other jurisdictions and the example of Tasmania is worth considering.  It has undertaken to designate the electronic Statute Book as the authentic version.  Can the Taoiseach envisage Ireland being able to provide assurances that the electronic version is the authentic version?  Can the Taoiseach compare the cost in Tasmania of providing a level of service in which the electronic version is the authentic one, with what is spent in Ireland to provide a system that essentially is useless as far as providing a verifiable electronic form of the Statute Book is concerned?  If not, I ask him to examine the matter.  How much work must still be done before one can state the on-line version is verifiable?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The work on the full CD-ROM was finished in 1998.  The error was only discovered last year by an official working in the section and it then took the office some time to ascertain the precise scale of the problem.  This has all been done.  Obviously, the officials have been back and forth with Juta Publishing Limited, the South African firm which did all of the work on this.  In the main, international people worked on the project because it was the first time we had done a job like this.Recently, as I stated in my reply, the office has been making use of the Centre for Management Organisation and Development, CMOD, of the Department of Finance to put forward a short to medium-term solution.  This has led the office to use a legal publishing company here to advise on the matter, which is what is happening at present.  A quotation document was issued to seven legal publishing companies and two responses were received by the October deadline.  Following the evaluation of the quotations received, it was recommended that Thomson Round Hall be requested to produce the report, subject to a contract.  I understand the contract has not yet been completed.It has been established that this problem is soluble and it is a question of cost.  The office had already enforced a penalty on the South African company previously, of approximately €130,000, for some other outstanding work.  However, it is co-operating in this regard and will co-operate with Thompson Round Hall in the preparation of the report to find a resolution to this matter.This morning, I asked staff in the Office of the Attorney General when they thought this process would get under way.  They hope it will get underway in January, immediately after Christmas, in order to rectify the difficulty as outlined by Juta Publishing Limited and the legal reporting company which has been engaged to correct the problems.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	37	When does the Taoiseach expect the process to be complete?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The process will not start until January.  However, I understand that if the problem is identified, it may not take too long to sort it out.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Does the Taoiseach accept the Government and technology do not appear to get on very well?  There has been the electronic voting fiasco and the PPARS debacle and now it transpires the Irish Statute Book cannot be properly put on the Attorney General's website.  Does the Taoiseach accept the presence of the Statute Book on the website of the principal law officer of the State serves as authentication that it is correct?  Does he accept it is horrific the laws made in the Oireachtas are not properly recorded there?  Will he give us some idea of what has been done so far other than issuing a disclaimer?  Is it merely telling people to ignore what is on the Attorney General's website?  Is that the essence of what has occurred so far?How much did it cost to organise this website?  The Taoiseach mentioned a South African company.  Has he any idea of what it will cost to fix it?  On the timeframe, he mentioned the possibility that work, from the point of view of finding a solution to the problem, might be under way in January.  Why were steps not put in hand straight away after the problem surfaced and why do we continue using an Attorney General's website which contains all these serious errors?  More importantly, will the Taoiseach give an approximate date by which all these issues will be cleared up?Overall, does the Taoiseach not accept this is a serious matter in that laws made must be promulgated and if that is done incorrectly, apparently authenticated by the principal law officer of the State, it could lead to a dreadful situation?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I do not wish to go back over the entire history of this project, which has been going on for the past decade.  As I said, the first release of the CD-ROM format was in December 1998 in respect of Acts from 1922 to 1997.  As Deputy Sargent stated, we do not use our technology as the authoritative legislative base.  I do not think anybody does that, other than perhaps——

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	43	The Greens are much stronger there.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Perhaps in the long term it is what we should do, but people are still using the Acts as they are.  Since then, the Office of the Attorney General has arranged for the publication of the Statute Book on the Internet for the past six years and it has been updated on three occasions.  Therefore, there have been companies other than the South African firm involved in it.The more recent updates include Acts, statutory instruments and chronological tables.  They are not all incorrect.  The error has been identified.  The fact that these were updated and many people were using and referring to the CD-ROMs and chronological tables shows it was an official who was doing an entirely different job in the Attorney General's department who came across this, but it is an error that must be corrected.The original contract cost just over €1 million.  That was to put all the Acts from 1922 to 1997 on CD-ROM.  The reason the error was not corrected straight away is that they had to, first, go back to those who were involved in the project initially and then follow through to those who were involved in the three subsequent updates to identify where the problem lay and identify responsibility for the problem, and then they had to put it out to tender.  They wanted to get a local firm which could assist in this and went out to seven legal publishing companies.They are now working on a contract with Thomson Round Hall to report on this.  They have not yet determined the cost involved, but they have identified the error and how the issue can be dealt with.  It is now a question of the company coming in to update this.  Given that the recent extensive updates cost €150,000, it should not be that costly.  It was a question of identifying the error.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	45	It is buttons compared to the money wasted elsewhere.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I do not consider it is waste.  The cost of €1 million to put on CD-ROM all our legislation since the foundation of the State, from 1922 to 1997, including the chronological tables, is not great in technology terms.  Unfortunately, there was an error in it which must be rectified and the project team has been working on that.  It has moved on to examine many other successful aspects of the technology in that Department but an error occurred in this area which must be corrected.  The team must now find the programme codes whereby this can be done.  To this end, a company has been brought in to help and the contract has been prepared for this purpose.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Is this a single error or a series of errors?  Is there any prospect of the State being sued as a result, by people who relied on the information they got from this website?  Does the Taoiseach agree with me that in terms of marketing ourselves as the intelligent island, it is not great PR that we cannot manage electronic voting, the electoral register or a website like this one?  We seem to have great difficulties when we bring in consultants and the answer appears to be to bring in more consultants to correct the first consultants' work.  Meanwhile, the cost keeps mounting up.  This seems to be a pattern going back to the computerisation of most Departments.  We made calamitous cock-ups, which were revealed in successive reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  These concerned the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and so on.  It is a very expensive business.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	48	As regards Deputy Rabbitte's first question, during the update process of the statutory instrument project it was established that a systematic error had occurred on a selection of data contained in the Acts and statutory instruments.  The error was caused by the insertion of hyper-links, or direct clickable links, to reference parts of the Acts or statutory instruments during the process of creating the CD-ROM version of the Act in 1999.  That caused some of the data to be overwritten.  No errors have been located in the post-1998 data.  It is a fact that technology systems throughout the world, and particularly in their start-up phase, are costly but one must start somewhere.  Problems regularly arise when working through such systems.  I am afraid that is par for the course in technology systems and has been for the last 25 years.  Thankfully, they seem to get on top of them after a period and they work well.  I am afraid, however, that the problem is not unique to this country.  In this instance, people were brought in from abroad in the belief that they would have great solutions that had worked elsewhere.  They also made mistakes, however, although admittedly only in some areas.

I would be interested to know if there is a timetable associated with that contract or is it open-ended.  Does the Taoiseach consider that once the work has been undertaken, this version will be the authentic one?  He referred to Tasmania as being unique, although I am not sure whether it is.  Is he saying that the Tasmanian standard of having an authentic version of the Statute Book on-line is somehow a bridge too far, a standard too high or something we will not be able to achieve?  Alternatively, is he saying that is the objective of the contract on which he is about to sign off?  At the end of that process, can the Taoiseach confirm that we will have an authentic, electronic Statute Book which will not have people scurrying about looking for the hard copy before they can make a decision?  Ultimately, the service will be ineffective if it is not authentic.  Will our standard be as high as Tasmania's or will we have to settle for something else?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I am advised there is no such difficulty because it was not seen as the authentic version of the legislation and this is the case in common law countries.  While the intention is to have each Act since 1922 stored in the correct form, as passed in this House, along with chronological tables and statutory instruments, it is not the authoritative version used in judgments in this and other countries.Regarding Deputy Sargent's query, a legal position has been taken and it is not a question of the technology involved.  I do not know that the issue of supplying the authentic version of legislation on-line has been addressed in Tasmania as completely as the Deputy suggests, but I will bring the matter to the attention of those involved here.The object of introducing a company to work with our South African colleagues, Juta Publishing Limited, the original contractor, is to correct the error.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe suggested there were errors, but it was a print over — the data was caused by the insertion of hyperlinks.  In layman's language that refers to referencing parts of the Act directly by clicking links and this facility was added as part of the process that caused data to be overwritten.  It was not a question of parts of the Act being taken out; the information was overwritten.  This rendered that section of chronological tables and statutory instruments fairly meaningless as the relevant links gave the wrong information.  I understand the other parts are still usable.  It is important to get this right and several other sections in other CD-ROMs have been checked in this regard.  The CD-ROM in question, which has been updated three times, contains all the legislation from 1922 to 1997, all statutory instruments and all chronological tables and is hugely beneficial.There is no difficulty with the latest update of the Internet version, comprising of Acts to the end of 2005, and 350 statutory instruments and chronological tables to the end of 2004.  Hopefully the problems relating to the other Acts will be fixed in the coming months, however none of these on-line versions are the authoritative versions of an Act.  I do not know when the electronic version will be the authoritative version or when such a decision will be made, and we will probably observe other common law jurisdictions to see how the issue is approached.The contract is to be signed before Christmas and hopefully the work will begin after Christmas.  The Secretary General in the Office of the Attorney General told me his staff are very anxious to do this work in the new year and have the matter rectified as soon as possible so that all legislation from 1922 to the end of 2004 is on CD-ROM.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	55	As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has shown an unrivalled commitment to ensuring that children and young people with special needs get the extra support they need to reach their full potential at school.  We have dramatically expanded investment in special education in recent years and improved access to State examinations for young people with special needs.  A range of accommodations is provided to enable students with disabilities to access the certificate examinations.  For example, enlarged print, Braille, translation, modified questions and use of a scribe, reader, personal assistant, tape recorder or word processor may be allowed depending on needs.The scheme was expanded in 2000 following the report of an expert advisory group to provide opportunities for exemptions where a candidate was not in a position to demonstrate achievement in a core area of assessment.  In keeping with the advice of the expert advisory group, a system of annotation was applied to any case where a student was exempt from a core area of assessment or where the mode of assessment used had the same effect.  This change, for example, enabled a hearing impaired student to be exempt for the first time from the aural component of language subjects.  His or her marks on the balance of the examination would be grossed up proportionately towards 100% and the certificate would include a note to the effect that all elements of the subject were assessed except the aural component.  Spelling and grammar waivers in language subjects were provided to cater for students with dyslexia on a similar basis, with annotation of the certificates.  The aim of these changes was to facilitate the operation of a responsive and flexible system which enables all candidates to demonstrate their achievements, while preserving the integrity and fairness of the exams by ensuring that special arrangements are operated in a transparent manner.The introduction of the expanded scheme was seen as important in widening access and promoting the optimum participation for students with disabilities.  Since then the number of students availing of accommodations in the certificate examinations has increased dramatically.  In 2002, 4,438 accommodations were granted, including 39 component exemptions and 1,945 spelling and grammar waivers.  By 2006, this number had increased to 12,136 accommodations, including 987 component exemptions, and 5,450 spelling and grammar waivers.An annotation only applies where a core element of assessment in a particular subject is not assessed.  This is used to ensure fairness and integrity vis-à-vis  other students who have been assessed in these components and in order not to mislead the end user of the certificate.In relation to the Equality Tribunal's findings the legal position is that they must either be implemented in full or appealed within the specified timeframe under the Equal Status Act 2002.  My Department has examined the findings and is concerned that the widening of access through the use of exemptions, coupled with annotations, has not been fully understood in this case and that the fundamental nature of the accommodations being provided has been questioned.  It has, therefore, been decided to appeal the findings.I have also asked the State Examinations Commission to re-examine policy and practice in this area because I am determined to ensure our system continues to evolve in line with best practice, promoting high standards of quality and integrity, while ensuring access, participation and benefit for all our students.

In what sense does including on the leaving certificate a statement that an accommodation has been granted ensure integrity and fairness?  The Equality Tribunal explicitly stated that the students in question had been disadvantaged by the Department.  This is a serious finding given that the Department's function is to ensure equality for all students sitting the leaving or junior certificate.The Dyslexia Association of Ireland stated that while the accommodations remove the disadvantage faced by the students in question, the inclusion of endorsements on certificates places them at a further disadvantage.  I ask the Minister to comment.While I welcome the Minister's decision to examine certain aspects of the findings, as recommended by the Equality Tribunal, I am concerned by the decision to appeal the tribunal's ruling.  How will this ensure integrity and fairness?  Ensuring integrity and fairness means equalising the exam for all students so they can all sit it in a fair way and receive the same certificates.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The figures on the types of accommodation and the numbers availing of them speak for themselves; they show how flexible and responsive the system is for young people with special needs.  The leaving certificate, however, is simply a statement of grades attained and subjects examined for all students.  A simple annotation at the end of the certificate happens to highlight for individual students where a core component was not examined and the marks were aggregated upwards.  The fairness and integrity are ensured by giving the students the accommodation they need and recognising their needs.  It is also an objective statement on exactly what was examined.  It is up to the end user of the certificate to decide if he wants to use it or why.  It is simply a factual statement of what was examined in the leaving certificate or junior certificate examinations for a particular year.Naturally we are anxious to accommodate as many students as possible but the ruling has called into question the whole issue of accommodations.  We have seen other countries draw back from the types of accommodation offered instead of adding annotations.  I do not want to see that happen.  We must strike a balance where we do not disadvantage students with special needs in State examinations while ensuring the certificate and the examinations are transparent.

If the finding of the tribunal is upheld, will certificates be adjusted retrospectively?  Students will be treated differently in job interviews if they have this on their certificate.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Approximately 26,000 certificates have been issued with annotations so it would be highly unlikely the ruling would be backdated, although that would be subject to an appeal.  Along with looking at the appeal, because I believe it did not take into consideration the range of accommodations and will have far-reaching consequences, I am also asking the State Examinations Commission to look at best practice internationally and ensure we are in line with that.  Our bona fides are proven by the range of accommodations and the growing numbers availing of them.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I have expressed a view on a number of occasions that some second-level schools do not appear to be doing as much as they could to welcome students with special needs.  I made a particular point of raising this when I attended the annual conferences of the education partners over the course of the year.It is the general position that a school cannot turn away a child solely because he or she has special needs.  A student may be refused enrolment on the basis of criteria in the school's published enrolment policy, such as those that relate to the school's catchment area, preference given to siblings of existing students etc., but the policy must be legal and cannot involve discrimination against special needs students.While the legal position on non-discrimination in enrolment policies is strong, some schools seem not to be officially refusing to take students with special needs but rather encouraging parents to apply elsewhere on the basis that another school would better meet their needs.I am concerned about this practice, particularly given all the extra investment that has been provided by this Government to ensure that all schools can cater for students with special needs.  In the current school year, more than 1,850 whole-time equivalent teachers and more than 1,350 special needs assistants have been allocated to second level schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of more than 200 teaching posts and more than 260 SNA posts on the previous school year.Of course, as well as the extra resources that have been provided in recent years, the process for accessing special needs supports has also been improved dramatically by the establishment of the National Council for Special Education and its teams of local organisers.  Schools now have a specific person to whom they can apply for supports based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual student.  All schools should see that there is now a strong system in place to ensure that special needs students get the additional resources they need.  It is necessary, however, for schools to be willing to be proactive and seek extra support from their local SENO.I also want all parents to be aware of both their legal rights and the fact that all schools have access to special needs supports, and will be asking the NCSE to assist in this regard.With regard to parents who feel that their child has unjustly been refused a school place, they may appeal the school's decision to the Secretary General of the Department under section 29 of the Education Act 1998.  Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and, where an appeal is upheld, the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.With the improvements that have been put in place in recent years, students with special needs should not only be welcome in all schools but should be embraced as part of an inclusive and caring school community.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I do not doubt the Minister's concern in this matter and her statements are welcome but she is the Minister for Education and Science — will she take action?  Will the Minister introduce regulations under section 33 of the Education Act, which allow for regulations on the entrance policies of schools?  Is the Minister willing to stand by and watch this apartheid take place in the school system?  It has been described in The Irish Times today as apartheid by the former principal of a comprehensive school where 10% of students have special educational needs while other schools in the area have no special needs children.  What will the Minister do other than telling people what she thinks about it?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The Deputy heard me highlighting this at all of the conferences this year and ensuring schools adopted inclusive enrolment policies, which is the best way to go.Much of the evidence we have is anecdotal because the parents are not being refused but are being referred in a positive way to another school.  For that reason they do not make a section 29 appeal.  I encourage parents to do that, however, because it gives us the evidence on schools that are operating segregated enrolment policies.  It would be open to regulation but schools must take children with special needs.  As a result of the lack of evidence under section 29 appeals, even though there have been 88 appeals so far this year, we are carrying out an audit of identified areas to see the effect on the ground that will give me real information on numbers.The Deputy referred to Mr. Derek West, the retired principal of Newpark Comprehensive School, who is correct in stating the numbers at the school.  He, like some other principals in the country, is a victim of the success of his school in welcoming students and providing top class facilities that are well supported by the Department of Education and Science.  Once a school gets a good name for dealing with children with special needs, the parents opt to send their children there.  It is the parents on the ground who are making the decision and that ends up letting other schools off the hook.There are a number of issues to take into consideration.  The schools, however, have heard my views and the parents who decide to follow through can give the evidence we need and the audit will show me that evidence.  After that I will be in a better position to decide what rules and regulations must be implemented.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Part of the problem, as the article points out in The Irish Times, is that under section 29, more children with special needs attend Newpark Comprehensive School because they have taken section 29 cases, increasing the numbers there.When the Minister amends section 29, which she has said she will do, will she insert regulations to ensure there is a balance in a particular area?  It states in the article that Newpark wanted to keep its current balance and was trying to reduce the number of special needs children as a result, because it had taken in more than its fair share.  When it tried to do so, section 29 appeals were used against it.  Does the Minister agree there is a need to change the legislation or make regulations to address this serious issue which divides the education system?If this is allowed to continue, it will be a very serious matter.  The Minister's lecturing will not change things, unfortunately.  It might do so if she was a teacher in a school but she is the Minister with responsibility for education.  Schools will not change their ways perhaps unless they are forced to do so by either regulation or legislation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	64	It is the case that parents are choosing to send their children to the school with the good name and good record.  I have some anecdotal evidence in my area of where some parents are paying to send their child of average or good academic ability to a fee-paying school while choosing to send their child with a learning difficulty to a different but non-fee-paying school.  Those are the kind of choices for which it is very difficult to legislate or create regulations.Of the 88 appeals with regard to refusals of post-primary schools to enrol pupils this year, 30 were upheld.  In other words, the parent won in the case of 30 appeals.

Three cases were resolved at facilitation and eight were resolved locally.  Twenty-two appeals were withdrawn and 25 went to a hearing and were not upheld.  Many of them were sorted out at local level.The Deputy is correct that the second school which does not admit the child is the school that suffers under section 29 of the Act.  This is all the more reason the parent in the first instance when their child has been turned down by a school needs to take the section 29 appeal against that school and not the one which is already very inclusive and does not take the child.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Estimates for 2007 for the Department of Education and Science include a provision of €9.8 million for the National Educational Welfare Board.  This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level.This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk.  Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.  The increase in funding for the board will allow it to expand its services further and increase staffing.Since we formally launched the board in December 2003, the number of staff has increased to 94.  The board operates through five regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide.  Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme.  In addition, the board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.  Educational welfare officers monitor school attendance and work to improve it.  They also help parents who are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.Since January 2004, 20,000 cases involving students with reported school attendance difficulties have been resolved by the board.  The NEWB has also written to every family with children of school going age advising them of their rights and responsibilities in respect of education and school attendance and where they can get help.The first national data on school attendance has also been collected and is being used to inform the board's work.  With respect to the effectiveness of the service, it is encouraging to note research findings that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved in 2004-05 compared with the previous year.The board is currently working on guidelines for schools on developing attendance strategies and the prevention of student absenteeism.  Work is also advanced on guidelines for codes of behaviour.While the NEWB was set up just three years ago, much has already been achieved by the service and the Government is committed to strengthening its role even further.However, it should be remembered that the board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school.  In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and services such as breakfast clubs and homework clubs.In addition to the NEWB, there are currently some 490 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance.  Home-school community liaison co-ordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school.  School attendance is a central objective of the school completion programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies.  Access to these services is being increased under the new action plan for tackling educational disadvantage, DEIS.

The Minister of State will be aware that the National Educational Welfare Board is the only body statutorily charged with dealing with school attendance issues.  Prior to the establishment of the board, the independent Rochford report recommended that at least 300 educational welfare officers were required.  The current numbers are less than 100 officers — the last figure I have is 79.  The Rochford report recommended that an investment of €25 million, which is approximately €28 million in today's figures, would be required.  Last year the Government provided €8 million and it is now providing €9.8 million.  While this is a 20% increase, will the Minister of State acknowledge this falls far short of the Rochford report recommendations?  When will the full complement of statutorily charged officers be rolled out?  Will it be in the lifetime of this Government or ten years down the road?

The Department of Education and Science and the Minister never accepted the Rochford report nor the reasoning in it.

This is a clear indication of any negotiations in any future Government which his party naturally aspires to.  I noticed the outbreak of realism on that side of the House in recent times——

The Rochford report was considered in great detail by the Department of Education and Science.  The officers of the Department examined the report and advised the then Minister, the predecessor to Deputy Hanafin, on the merits and demerits of that report.  A view was taken in the Department about how the Act should be implemented.  I think my reply makes it clear that an amount of progress has been made in implementing this legislation.  It is very encouraging to see that welfare officers are making a difference on the ground.I agree with Deputy Gogarty that important statutory responsibilities are cast on this board as well as important statutory functions such as the power to institute prosecutions where parents fail and are derelict in their duty of ensuring their child attends school.  This is a fundamental matter.  I note the old school attendance service with a far smaller complement of staff had far more prosecutions before the courts than this board has so far secured.  This is not to say the board has not instituted some prosecutions but I make that point that a Department has a duty in legislation of this type to see to it that the work is progressed.  The legal responsibilities to which the Deputy refers make reference to the power of the board to institute prosecutions and to exact certain information from the principals of the different schools, both primary and secondary.  As school principals have no doubt advised Members on all sides of the House, the board has been assiduous in obtaining that information and in insisting that it be forwarded.  This has given the board the first comprehensive data on this subject which is to be welcomed.  On foot of this legislation, there is a much clearer picture of the position than ever before.  There is a strategy in place, the legislation has been implemented and it forms a basis for progress in this area.  I wish to disabuse the Deputy of the idea that the Rochford report was in some way accepted by the Government because it never was.  The Government accepts an obligation under the Act and the National Educational Welfare Board has obligations which it is meeting.  The Government will continue to support the board.  Any fair examination of the provision that has been made and the number of staff now involved which is currently 94, will show a substantial commitment by the Government to the operation of this board.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I thank the Minister of State for clarifying the Government position on the Rochford report.  My party has already stated it will implement the recommendations in full.  I am glad the Minister of State says he is not interested in implementing it under current policy because what the Government is implementing is so far removed from the recommendations of the report that there is no comparison.  The Minister of State mentioned value for money in terms of what is currently being spent.  The Government is delivering value for money because, for example, the ratio of welfare officer to student is 1:12,000, compared to 1:3,000 in Britain.  Approximately 84,000 students aged under 16 are missing more than 20 days per year while approximately 28,000 are missing more than 40 days per year.  The latter figure equates to approximately 1,000 classrooms full of children.  While current expenditure may represent value for money, will the Department invest more money so that we can put more value into the system and ensure that children actually go to school and get an education?

The board is also responsible for assisting parents in the preparation of section 29 appeals.  The board meets those legal responsibilities.  In addition, the board has other responsibilities which are, strictly speaking, not legal ones.  These involve helping, advising and guiding parents, and that is important.  There are 490 staff employed in the system.  An additional 137 individuals are deployed in educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element.  I do not know if the Deputy included that when he drew the comparison with British figures.  A further 137 are due to come on stream under the DEIS initiative in the coming months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Government is determined to ensure that all students have the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and to acquire the necessary skills for participation in the information society.  To this end, we have put in place significant investment and new initiatives to increase the number of computers in our schools, to provide a range of ICT training options for teachers, to improve the availability of online resources and to ensure that all schools have broadband access.Between 1998 and 2005, more than €170 million was invested in the schools ICT programme, including €114 million in capital supports.  This helped to improve the number of computers in our schools, a fact reflected in the 2005 census of ICT infrastructure in schools published recently by the National Centre for Technology in Education.  The census was conducted during the first half of 2005, and is the fourth in a series that began in 1998.  The 2005 census shows improved pupil to computer ratios at both primary and second level.  At primary level, there was one computer for every nine children in 2005 compared with one for 11 in 2002.  At second level there was one computer for every seven students in 2005.  In special schools, the census found a pupil-computer ratio of 3:1.As the Deputy will be aware, the major focus for investment over the past two years has been on developing computer networks in schools and ensuring schools have broadband access.  The census was carried out at a point when schools were beginning to fully avail of this funding.  The schools broadband access programme comprises three elements, local connectivity to schools, a national broadband network and a national service desk at a cost of approximately €30 million.  As of 14 November last, 96% of schools have local broadband connectivity, including the installation of a broadband router.  The remaining schools are predominately those that currently have a building project under way and broadband installation will be carried out in tandem with completion of the building works.  A small number of schools elected to continue with their existing broadband provision.A lot of extra investment has been provided for the schools ICT programme in recent years.  We have also ensured that extra investment in infrastructure has been complemented by an increased focus on teacher training.  The National Council for Technology in Education has provided 10,000 training places annually in recent years to meet the specific needs of teachers in their use of ICT, including technical courses, subject specific courses, and Internet, web design and digital media courses.While the ICT facilities in our schools have improved considerably, I am conscious of the need for further investment to ensure that we are realising the full potential of ICT to improve the learning experience for our young people.  To that end, I intend to publish a comprehensive new ICT strategy in 2007 covering the period of the new national development plan to 2013.  A critical challenge under this new strategy will be to develop an e-learning culture in schools with a central objective of embedding the use of ICT in teaching and learning across the curriculum rather than a focus on treating ICT as a separate subject.

I have been critical of the fact that we did not have one since the end of 2002.  Both the Minister and I have read the report and can therefore choose different sets of statistics.  Arising from the report of the National Council for Technology in Education, I am concerned that 10,000 computers in primary schools are in need of upgrade or repair and 5,000 are beyond repair or use.  Therefore, one in four computers in primary schools does not work, while one in five does not work at second level.  Some 29% of primary school computers are more than six years old and the Minister will know how quickly computers are evolving.I welcome the fact that 96% of schools now have broadband access.  However, the broadband connections are already going out of date.  It is difficult to deal with, but higher speed access is always required to meet the rapid changes in technology.  The type of broadband available in many of our schools does not have the capacity to download certain files from the Internet and to access certain websites.How does the Minister intend to deal with those problems?  How will she ensure that all computer hardware in primary schools is functioning?  Does the Minister have any intention of providing a service to allow equipment to be upgraded?  Providing maintenance locally would probably be the better idea, but what type of maintenance does she propose to ensure school computers are usable and neither sitting in boxes nor beyond use?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	82	It is unfortunate that computers go out of date so quickly.  Despite considerable investment in hardware in recent years, it can be difficult to keep it up to date.  Our priority in the past couple of years had to be on networking and broadband — there was not much point in schools having computers if they did not have this connectivity.  The existing broadband access is perfectly adequate for the type of work that schools are doing.  For the most part, they are not downloading files and much of the work involves using particular software for educational purposes.  I have seen this in use in schools.While we will introduce a new programme in the NDP, industry also has a major role to play.  Industry is constantly asking for more computers to be installed in schools.  Industry, as well as computer manufacturers, benefits most from such investment.  Whereas industry played a part in the broadband roll-out, there is an opportunity for it to get involved in investing in school hardware.  If a child is using a particular model in school, he or she will want to use the same model at home.  This could complement what we are trying to do in the schools.The census asked questions about technical support and it found that 68% of primary schools and 55% of post-primary schools use the services of IT contractors without fixed contracts, while others had fixed contracts.  Of course, there is also ICT co-ordinating teachers within education centres and they play an important role in providing technical support.  If one's computer does not work, one is able to call someone to have it fixed and it is important that a school should have that facility as well.  This is one of the issues I am examining in the overall strategy.

I would welcome more industry involvement in the provision of equipment, but until it wakes up and decides to do that, we must ensure that students are getting the ICT facilities they need in the classroom.Will the Minister reconsider the idea of having ICT as a distinctive subject?  If we are to build a knowledge economy, it is vital that students have the necessary skills.  Has the Minister had any discussions with industry about getting more involved in this area?  She should bear in mind that it is the country, not just industry, which benefits from industry being successful.  We have a changing economy which must be knowledge-led and driven.  If this is to happen, it must start in schools and responsibility for it lies not with industry but with the Minister.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The integration of ICT into schools is what is crucial rather than segregating it into a subject which inevitably in the case of the leaving certificate would become a choice subject.  What is even more important is that teachers integrate it into their teaching and students into their learning.  There is some good software now but it is more important that teachers have the training to be able to use it in a curricular sense rather than have a separate subject.Increasingly, we see ICT coming into the main curriculum subjects.  For example, the new technology subject involves computer-aided design.  That new subject will be examined for the first time in 2009 as it will be introduced in schools in 2007.  Here we have an integration of the technology into a subject.  We also see students using it in other subjects.  Film, for example, which is part of the Gaeilge course for the leaving certificate, uses computer technology as well.In recent months, the digital school awards, under the NCTE, have encouraged schools to be more innovative in the way in which they use the technology.  I presented some of the awards in the schools and it is fascinating to see how they are integrating it into the wider school curriculum.  I would like to see that cross-curricular culture of comfort of learning and of teaching being used in all the schools rather than segregating it as a separate subject.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The majority of the 412 schools participating in the school completion programme in 2006 operate breakfast clubs or other meal provision, in accordance with the nutritional guidelines issued by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  In addition to the funding provided through the school completion programme, the provision of school meals is primarily funded by the school meals programme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, and involving both an urban scheme operated by local authorities and a local projects scheme.Educational research has shown that good nutrition improves concentration levels of students and that students from low income families are less likely to have access to an adequate diet.  The social aspect of breakfast clubs cannot be overestimated and access to such clubs is offered on a whole class-whole school basis to encourage integration of children and young people, giving them an opportunity to mix and relax before classes commence.Breakfast clubs provide a caring and supportive environment where young people can engage with their peers and discuss things in a social setting.  This also provides an opportunity to prepare for the school day.  Parents are also encouraged to become involved in running breakfast clubs, many of which are also supported by charitable agencies which bring with them expertise such as family support.The school meals programme aims to supplement the nutritional intake of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to allow them to fulfil their potential within the educational system and also to reduce the risk of early school leaving.  In 2006, it is estimated that 69,903 children benefited in 1,008 schools under the local projects scheme and the urban scheme provided support for more than 386 primary schools, with 55,000 pupils.  In 2006, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has provided funding of approximately €10.4 million for the programme, an increase of almost 27% on the 2005 provision of €8.2 million.The Department of Education and Science has been working in close co-operation with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure that the resources available for school meals are used to best effect and to further expand school meals provision in schools serving disadvantaged communities.  Each of the 873 schools participating in the new school support programme under DEIS, the new action plan for educational inclusion, will have access to the school meals programme.In addition, it is proposed that under the dormant accounts fund a once-off start-up grant will be provided to schools commencing participation in the school meals scheme to provide suitable facilities and purchase equipment.  The provision of breakfast clubs will continue to be a priority for the Government in tackling educational disadvantage.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I thank the Minister for her reply.  We all favour the concept of the breakfast club.  Most people to whom I have spoken about it believe it is a good idea.  The frustration in many areas surrounds funding, roll-out and the quality of the clubs.  Some people believe calling them breakfast clubs is a probably a bad idea and that if they were called Internet clubs and if music was played, it would encourage more students to come into school for the meal.The Minister mentioned the number of schools involved.  Will these clubs be rolled out in all schools in CLÁR and RAPID areas, or is it up to schools or the school completion programme in an area to determine in which schools they are rolled out?  I have also been given information on some schools where there are breakfast clubs for two days a week rather than five.  Has the Minister a view on that and the confusion it causes children?  If we are to have these clubs, they should run over a five day period.The Minister spoke about nutritional issues.  Will the Department get more involved in these clubs in the future given the concerns in this area?  In regard to the funding of these clubs, community education, etc, is funding available from the Minister's Department or any other Department for groups outside the schools system, such as those dealing with young people at risk of dropping out of school?It is important these clubs are warm, interactive and welcoming and have a calming influence on children.  As I said, everyone on this side of the House agrees with them.  A club which is grim, bleak and cold will not attract young people.  The clubs are a positive step for young people.I am concerned about the roll-out of these clubs and the co-ordination between the Departments.  Are there any plans in regard to future school buildings?  Will kitchens be provided so that there is the possibility of hot meals?  Some schools are talking about not only breakfast clubs but about lunchtime clubs to encourage young people to stay in school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	87	We do not mind what schools call these clubs.  They can call them Internet clubs or whatever.  If the meal is being provided, any positive way to get children into the clubs is all right with us and, I am sure, with the Department of Social and Family Affairs once the money is used properly.  As the Deputy said, there are schools which offer lunch, or a dinner, as well as breakfast.  Last week, I was in a school in Athy where every child gets a healthy break — a healthy milk drink or some variation of it, such as a yogurt.  While I was there, the young girls were having shepherd's pie, which was beautifully laid out.  I could get a waft of the beautiful shepherd's pie.

What I thought was a lovely idea was that they insist the girls sit down at properly set tables.  They are not allowed to have books, games or anything with them so they must engage in conversation.  They are learning basic table manners while at the same time communicating with each other rather than sitting in front of the television or a Game Boy with food on their laps.I have seen inner city schools where parents come in very early in the morning to organise the breakfast for the breakfast club and then healthy sandwiches and rolls for the children.  The programme is being implemented in different ways.  Schools are able to decide how to implement it given their facilities, needs and the voluntary activity of some parents or whatever staff are available.  We are very anxious all the schools in DEIS are able to benefit from it.  At present, approximately 474 schools in DEIS are not involved.  They are being written to on a phased mailshot basis, inviting them to apply to participate so that we can roll it out in an organised way.  All the schools will be invited to participate.Not all the breakfast clubs take place in the school.  Under the local projects scheme, some of them take place in a community hall or some other local facility.  Again, that links into the community and organisations working with families.  It is a good and integrated way to do it.  I am not sure Jamie Oliver's way of doing it in the UK school meals system worked.  Certainly, the idea of healthy, nutritious food is important for children.The last thing we want is to set up big structures with environmental health officers, etc, coming in and the whole thing getting out of control.  What is happening now is a really positive and valuable way to support children and their families.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	90	My Department approaches the evaluation of its programmes and initiatives in a number of different ways.  One of these is the formal Government programme of value for money reviews, formerly called expenditure reviews, in which my Department participates.  The objectives of these reviews, which were introduced in 1997, are to analyse Exchequer spending in a systematic manner and to provide a basis on which more informed policy and expenditure decisions can be made.Value for money reviews are one of a range of modernisation initiatives aimed at moving public sector management away from the traditional focus on inputs to concentrate more on the achievement of results.  They are organised on the basis of three year planning periods.  The current programme of reviews is scheduled to be completed in the 2006-08 period.A critical component of my Department's approach to evaluation is the work of the evaluation support and research unit of the inspectorate, which focuses on educational outcomes.  The unit co-ordinates periodic evaluations of the quality of educational provision in primary and post-primary schools and centres for education.  The approach to conducting these evaluations usually involves collection of data about student achievement levels and observation in classrooms by inspectors to determine the quality of learning and teaching.  Interviews and meetings are also held with key stakeholders in the relevant schools and centres for education.Over and above this, my Department, through its line management divisions, examines particular issues, programmes and elements of programmes to inform changed approaches.  This forms part of the general obligation on public sector managers to ensure that State funds are utilised in an efficient and effective manner.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	91	My question relates not so much to schools as to other bodies set up by the Department of Education and Science, for example, bodies such as the National Educational Welfare Board to which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred in his reply to Deputy Gogarty.  The Minister of State said that board meets its obligations.  What I am curious about is how he judges it meets its obligations.  We do not know there is an improvement in school completion rates or in the number of students making the transition from primary to post-primary level.  How do we evaluate that?We could also look at the example of the school completion programme which has one national co-ordinator, four assistants and 65 cluster co-ordinators.  Separate advertisements are issued for all of these at a cost of €3,000 each.  The Department still makes the major decisions on the programme and there is an automatic increase in funding each year.  Are we actually getting more students to complete school each year?I support Youthreach and am glad to see more funding allocated to it.  However, it is still at pilot stage and we have not evaluated whether it should be extended or more could be achieved through it.  I would like to see more evaluation done on these types of initiatives.  How do the Minister and her officials evaluate such bodies?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The best way to answer the question is to give examples of the evaluations that have taken place.  Two of these were published during the summer, namely, the review of the supply teacher scheme for primary schools and the review of the small school and permanent accommodation initiative.  These reviews covered two very different areas.It is easier to assess something like capital funding because one can see results, whereas it is not so easy to see results in other areas.  The review of the small school and permanent accommodation initiative showed it provided value for money for taxpayers.  The schools in the initiative got better accommodation more quickly than if they had gone through the traditional programme and acquired permanent rather than temporary accommodation.  The funding control mechanisms were found effective and school management authorities were satisfied.  It was easy, therefore, to assess that initiative.The review of the supply teacher initiative concluded the scheme generally contributes positively to primary education in the areas in which it operates, though levels of success vary.  The scheme was found to be relatively expensive in terms of cost per day of substitution, but that had to be balanced with other educational and policy issues.  The review concluded that the effective provision of quality substitution would need a mixed market approach to supply the teacher scheme agency supplying casual substitution.  This is valuable information for future policy direction.  We know now we should not just take one route on the supply teacher scheme but that we need to have a balance.  The review, therefore, identified a particular issue of value to us.The DEIS scheme arose from the evaluation of existing schemes which were deemed too disparate and not sufficiently concentrated.  This led directly into policy.Deputy Enright mentioned she was interested in Youthreach.  Some of the reviews under way include a review of the youth encounter projects, the schools ICT support services and the ICT undergraduate skills programme.  New reviews proposed are a review of Youthreach, senior Travellers training centres, teacher education and school insurance arrangements.  A range of reviews is being undertaken to establish the initiatives we will use for the next couple of years.  These reviews look at education from the point of view of people and the buildings involved and at various other areas.I accept the Deputy's point that we need to be able to evaluate the results of these initiatives.  That is the aim of this project.  We used only look at things in the context of the inputs we made, but now we also look at the results.  These types of reviews will help us to determine future policy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The Government is determined to ensure that every child is educated in a suitable and comfortable environment.  Since 1997, great advances have been made in transforming school accommodation throughout the country through an investment of €3 billion.  This has funded 7,800 individual school projects in the past seven years alone.  This year we will spend €500 million on school buildings compared with just over €90 million in 1997.  Under the 2006 budget, €3.9 billion is being provided over the years 2006-10 for capital projects at all levels of the education sector from primary to third level.While the challenge before us in reversing decades of underinvestment in school buildings and in responding to emerging needs in new population areas is great, nonetheless we are making huge progress.  The level of work being done under the school building programme is at an all-time high.  While increased investment has been a central reason for this, the introduction of new schemes and changes in how projects are managed have also made a major difference.Almost 800 schools were approved for summer works projects this year.  This innovative scheme, which allows schools to get small projects done over the summer holidays, did not exist when we came into office and schools were waiting for many years for improvements such as rewiring, new roofs or windows.  Now when the school gates close for the summer, the builders move in and the students come back to an improved environment just a few short months later.To reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have also been developed for eight and 16-classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees.  Improvements have also been made in forward planning through greater co-operation with local authorities and the publication of area development plans.With regard to school building projects awaiting progression, the Deputy will be aware that the number of projects and their individual classifications can vary according to the stage of assessment and their progression though the building programme.  At present, my Department has in the region of 1,300 applications for building works on the main building programme.  These applications can range from extensions and refurbishments to applications for new schools on new sites.  Their status can range from applications recently received in the Department to projects at various stages of architectural planning.These projects are assessed and prioritised in accordance with the prioritisation criteria agreed with the education partners.  In this regard, it should be noted that a project's banding can be subject to reassessment having regard to demographic developments in the area served by the school and also, for example, if on foot of a technical examination of the school it is found that the proposed project put forward by the school is not an appropriate design solution to meet the accommodation requirements.In addition to the projects mentioned, there are approximately 400 applications under the small schools initiative and the permanent accommodation scheme, but many of these may also have applied under the main programme.  These applications are currently being assessed with a view to an announcement being made shortly.  In addition, applications for the summer works scheme 2007 are being evaluated.The €3.9 billion envelope provided for education capital in the 2006 budget means that significant progress will continue to be made on school buildings in the coming years.  This year alone, over 1,300 building projects will be delivered.

I have asked several questions on the issue but did not get specific answers.  I am glad to hear 1,300 projects are in the pipeline.  However, schools are entitled to know where they stand.  Up to two years ago schools were able to check their position on the website and this saved people much time, particularly officials from the Department.  On the website people could see the prioritisation and banding given to their schools.  I ask the Minister to reinstate that facility because it was the most democratic and transparent way of operating and showing schools where they stood.  I accept assessments and prioritisations may change for demographic reasons etc.  People should be made aware of those reasons.  I urge the Minister to reconsider providing this type of information on the website.  I and other Deputies do not want Department officials spending time answering parliamentary questions in regard to individual schools.  However, local people in different areas come to us for information and want to know the banding and the priority being given.  It is unacceptable that this information is not available.

It no longer applies that we must spend all capital funding within a particular year.  It is a rolling capital envelope, so we can show that more and more projects are getting into the system.Given that 1,300 schools undertook modernisation projects this year, it is important they would be dealt with under a number of different schemes, particularly devolved schemes.  Later this week I will announce another batch of schools that will go to tender over the next year to 15 months or so.  There will then be a further announcement with regard to the summer works scheme for next year to allow schools to plan properly, and a further announcement on the permanent initiative.  With so many schools undertaking projects, the schools realise the investment taking place is helping them to deliver both small scale and large scale solutions for schools that have experienced under-investment for many years.Some 1,300 schools are in the building programme and this year alone 1,300 schools — it is a coincidence of numbers — are undertaking building projects.  Significant progress is being made on all of those buildings.

For example, there are five Gaelscoileanna in my constituency, four of which are in temporary accommodation — one in particular, Gaelscoil Sáirséil, is in appalling condition.  Another example is that of the Educate Together schools.  Of the 23 new Educate Together schools opened since 2000, 22 are in temporary accommodation.  Educate Together has had to refuse four groups of parents in various parts of the country applications under their patronage for new schools due to the cost of schools being housed in temporary accommodation.  It is a serious problem.  For example, a parent in Carlow to whom I spoke thought a school would open next year but it now has no patron.Will the Minister address the problem of schools remaining in temporary accommodation for such a long period, particularly with regard to the Educate Together crisis?

They too are entitled to the facilities they need.  A new school coming on stream only gets permanent recognition after three years.  Each school has to prove there is a need for it and that it will have the numbers.  It will never be possible to give them permanent accommodation in a new area.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	119	After ten years of this Government, waiting has become a legacy.  It is what we do.  Every day people are forced to wait in traffic, children wait for months to see an orthodontist, patients wait for years to see a neurologist and people wait for up to a decade to receive a house from a local authority.  Today, like every other day, 274 men and women wait on trolleys in units throughout the country.  Every day, in every public service we try to use, waiting has become a national pastime.  It is the legacy of the past ten years.I want the Taoiseach to imagine a different kind of waiting.  I want him to imagine the plight of a woman who has been sexually abused or raped in this city on a Friday night.  Her first instinct is to scrub herself clean but she cannot do that.  She too has to wait.  She has to wait in those clothes, not for hours but for days, for the simple reason that the Government has provided inadequate resources and there is no doctor on duty in the Rotunda assessment unit.  That woman, who has been sexually abused or raped, will wait on Friday evening, all day Saturday and all Saturday night.  She cannot have a shower and is unable to feel clean again simply because to do so would destroy the evidence which nobody is able to take up because there is no doctor on duty until Sunday evening.This happens not only in Dublin.  Recently, two women who were sexually abused and assaulted had to travel to be treated in Dublin because no facilities were available locally.  There are times in Cork when women who have been raped or sexually assaulted must travel to Waterford for treatment.Women wait and suffer while the rapists go on about their lives.  This happens because there are insufficient gardaí and because assault unit staff are not present to collect evidence when they should be.  These women, having been raped or assaulted, must wait for lengthy periods in the clothes they wore when the assault occurred because we do not have doctors on duty and insufficient staff are available to take evidence when necessary.The cost of sorting out this problem is a mere €3 million.  I ask the Taoiseach, as the leader of the country and the Head of Government, in these days of protest about violence against women, whether the time has come to treat this matter with political will and as a political priority.  Will the Taoiseach allocate €3 million to sort out this problem and not have women who have been raped or sexually abused waiting, weekend after weekend, in the same clothes for days on end because no doctor is available and no one is available to take the evidence, which would be destroyed if they showered and cleaned themselves off as they want to do?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	120	This had not been brought to my attention until I watched the RTE report last week which indicated that on the weekend before last a number of women were, as described by Deputy Kenny, left waiting in the Rotunda sexual assault treatment unit, and were told to wait in their clothes for a prolonged period in poor facilities.  I raised the matter with the HSE and asked for an explanation of the position.There is dispute, as there always is on these issues.  I was going on what I saw.  The chairperson of the rape crisis unit gave an even-handed report on the circumstances and the requirement for resources.  There is dispute about the facts of what actually happened in the unit.  That is neither here nor there.  These are small units.  It does not seem like a big issue or a big financial issue to resolve.  There are four sexual assault treatment units in the Irish Republic — in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Letterkenny.  It is recognised that it can be difficult to obtain medical expertise for forensic examination.  The national review of sexual assault treatment services recommends the establishment of further units in the west and midlands to ensure nobody is more than three hours' drive from a sexual assault treatment unit.  The HSE has identified a resource requirement to develop such units.  It has argued that such works should be covered in the 2007 Estimates.  That request is being examined.  Services for people who report rape or sexual assault should, as far as possible, be available locally.  It is vital that such services are provided within a short period of time by practitioners who conduct the relevant examinations on a regular basis.  It has been suggested to me that issues relating to skills and the level of expertise should be addressed.  I have also been asked to ensure that a unit is established in the west.  There are two issues in this regard.  One issue relates to what is needed in 2007.  The other issue relates to what happened in the Rotunda Hospital the weekend before last.  I have asked that it not happen again.

I was shown what happened over an enormous amount of weekends.  There was a problem on a certain weekend and then a campaign was lined up around that weekend.  The information I received related to the number of victims presenting for examination and treatment.  I was told there is a sexual assault reporting rate of nine for every 100,0000.  I was also told that the services had been provided way beyond that.  I do not know whether they had or had not.  The fact is that a coherent argument was made to the effect that there was a major problem on the weekend in question.  I took up the matter on that weekend.  I received all kinds of figures to show that adequate numbers of staff are available.  The case in question relates to one doctor.  I do not intend to get into an argument about why a doctor was not in the Rotunda Hospital on a certain weekend.  People were rostered.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	147	This problem could be sorted by the provision of €2.8 million.  The Taoiseach's reply did not deal with the anguish, torment and mental desperation of women who have been raped and then have to sit in their own clothes from Friday or Saturday night until Sunday evening because no doctors are available.  That would not have happened when the Taoiseach was the financial director of the Mater Hospital.  He would have made sure there was a doctor on duty.  The report published in June found there is no unit in the west or the midlands, that the unit in Letterkenny is closed and that the unit in Cork does not operate effectively.  The remaining units are those in Waterford and Dublin.  I have been informed by the Rape Crisis Centre that the weekend before last, a garda drove a woman who had been raped and sexually assaulted around in a squad car because there was no unit to go to.  It is absolutely appalling that something like that should happen in 2006.  The Government intends to spend €54 billion next year, but it cannot provide €2.8 million to sort out our sexual assault treatment units.  People who perpetrate crimes of this nature — rapists — should be subject to the process of the law and should be put where they belong, which is behind bars.  It is perfectly obvious that nobody is being arrested because the number of convictions has decreased seriously.  It seems that just 5% of reported rapes go to court.I would like the Taoiseach to answer some questions.  The provision of €2.8 million would sort this out.  This should be a matter of political priority for everybody in this House and outside it.  It is not as if there is no campaign in this regard.  However, there is no understanding of the mental anguish, torment and desperation that women have to suffer, weekend after weekend, in this city and elsewhere.  I would like the Taoiseach to respond to me by saying the Government will provide the approximately €3 million that is needed to sort out this problem and to put it aside.  The unfortunate victims of sexual assault and rape should be able to go to units of this nature to clean themselves, or be cleaned, after the evidence that needs to be taken has been taken.  Those who perpetrate these awful crimes should be subject to the process of the law and put behind bars.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	152	The facilities of the sexual assault treatment unit there were available, but there was no doctor.  We are spending €14 billion on the health service.  The facts relating to what happened are disputed.  I am not responsible for rostering doctors, as I said.  Given that the unit was on call, it should have been operational.  The resources which are needed are provided in a number of units.  What happened was not acceptable.  The women in question should not have been treated in such a manner.  Regardless of the various arguments — I have heard reports from both sides — it should not have happened.  That is the point.  It should not happen on any other weekend.We also need to consider a second issue.  There are four sexual assault treatment units, in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Letterkenny.  A request has been made for the provision of a further unit in Galway.  The national reporting rate is nine per 100,000.  I understand there is not a difficulty.  In the west and north-west regions, the rates are 3.6 and 4.4 respectively and I am told that is well-catered for.  There is a difficulty in Galway, where a new unit is being sought.  It is obvious that there are issues relating to the administration of the unit in the Rotunda Hospital.  The Minister for Finance is dealing with the request for additional resources.  It may already have been dealt with in the Estimates for 2007, so the service can be extended throughout the country.  Under the criteria which were set out, which were based on the sexual assault reporting rate per 100,000 people, the victims of sexual assault should be treated within three hours.  That is what was set down and agreed.  I understand that the request, with which I agree, will be delivered on in 2007.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I am sure everyone in this House will join the tributes which were paid in the Northern Assembly to the civilian security personnel who managed to avoid an outrage in the Stormont premises.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the drama outside Stormont diverted attention from the lack of progress that was made in the Chamber itself?  The approach of the two Governments has been characterised by consistent slippage, unfortunately.  I say that as someone who has consistently supported the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in terms of the St. Andrews Agreement.We were told prior to the St. Andrews Agreement that if all parties did not unequivocally sign up to the Governments' requirements, plan B would immediately be put into effect for enhanced co-operation between the two Governments.  They then went ahead and set up new deadlines during the St. Andrews process.  Most of the deadlines have since been missed.  The preparation for government committee was to meet on October 18, but did not do so.  All parties were to consult, come back and give an unequivocal response to the agreement by 10 November.  The responses of the DUP and Sinn Féin were half-hearted at best.We were also assured that Sinn Féin was ready to sign up to policing and that an announcement would be made about holding an Ard-Fheis, but no such announcement has yet been made.  On 18 October, the Taoiseach told the House: "We are also clear that in the event of failure to reach agreement on 24 November, we will proceed on the basis of the new British-Irish partnership arrangements to implement the agreement."  That did not happen and, worse, the Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Hain announced — presumably with the Taoiseach's agreement — that he was prepared to water down the conditions further so that the parties were only required to indicate, as distinct from nominate, a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister.Whatever about statements that have been made elsewhere, is it not the case that the only place we can get the necessary commitments is in the Chamber of the Assembly itself?  Is the Taoiseach saying that he accepts that interviews given by Dr. Paisley outside the Chamber meet the requirements now posed by the two Governments?  Does he accept the situation in which the Secretary of State apparently directed the speaker to accept whatever the party leaders were going to say?  Dr. Paisley, normally a blunt speaker, neither indicated nor nominated, nor was nominated, for the position of First Minister.  However, by what appeared to be a prior arrangement, and rescued in a ghoulish way by Mr. Michael Stone, the speaker of the Chamber said that she accepted it as an indication, as required by the Secretary of State.As the leader of a party that has consistently supported the commendable efforts of the Taoiseach, I would like to hear his views on where we stand now.  There has been a record of consistent slippage since before the St. Andrews process started.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I appreciate the support of the Deputy and all the leaders in the House for the Good Friday Agreement.  I regret the actions of Michael Stone on Friday.  There could have been a real disaster and I commend those involved.What we agreed at St. Andrews was a significant breakthrough from the old view of the parties that they would not move towards setting up an executive.  In April, Prime Minister Blair and I said that we would set 24 November as the date when we wanted to get the full Executive working in Northern Ireland.  The parties were to start working with each other from that date.  They eventually started working with each other in the summer and while we did not agree on everything in those summer talks, substantial progress was made.As I reported to the House on the resumption of the Dáil, that progress led us to a position where we thought we could move the parties towards setting up the Executive again.  I also made it clear at that stage that this would not happen by 24 November.  I also made it clear that we would move to plan B if we had to do so, but that it was not the desired solution.Last Friday, I said that I was not satisfied with what happened in the Assembly.  It was not what Dr. Paisley said, but what he did not say.  He has since clarified that.  Deputy Rabbitte asked me if I was satisfied that Dr. Paisley has made it clear that he will be the party's nominee when the time comes next March and the answer is "Yes" provided the issue of policing is addressed.  I accept that he has addressed that issue and he did so again yesterday in an interview on RTE.  His party colleagues also made it clear to the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and others.  That issue is clear.Sinn Féin must deal with policing and there are still some outstanding issues, especially those related to MI5.  Those can hopefully be cleared and we are still working to resolve them.  The programme for government committee, which should have started six weeks ago, started last week with a useful meeting and there was another useful meeting yesterday.  It is now up and running.  As Deputy Rabbitte knows well, dealing with Northern Ireland is always pull and tuck.  People never work to the deadlines we want, but progress is always made along the way.  We are now in a position where the DUP, Sinn Féin, the UUP and the SDLP will set up a working Executive based on the legislation that was passed last week.  If they do not move on as agreed, particularly with issues related to devolution of policing, there is a power in the legislation to strike it down.  I hope that will not be necessary.I interpret last Friday's meeting in positive terms.  Dr. Paisley believed that he had clarified the situation and I will not argue whether his silence clarified it.  He clarified it shortly afterwards and I am satisfied and so are others that he has done so.  It would have been better if he had clarified it in the Assembly.  I welcome the fact that the nomination process has been taken.  It is deemed to have been taken under the legislation and the Assembly, the British Government and the parties all accept that.There are a few big hurdles ahead, especially involving policing.  If policing is not dealt with before the Assembly and its transitionary form collapses, there would not be much point in having an election.  It has to happen before that date in late January.  The sooner it happens, the better.  Bringing it to a late date will only create more tension and more dissent and difficulties within many parties.In the meantime, the programme for government committee must deal with a substantive agenda.  It should have been dealing with it since October, but hopefully it can deal with it now.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I welcome the Taoiseach's positive disposition, but it must be asked why parties have not adhered to successive deadlines.  The Taoiseach stated in the House:The Assembly is expected to meet to nominate the First and Deputy First Minister on 24 November.  This has always been a key date for the Governments and it remains so.  All going well, we will have a first Minister and Deputy First Minister for the first time in four years.There is a view that there was more focus on the date than on content and that the threshold was constantly lowered along the way.  The more the threshold was lowered, the less unequivocal were the statements from two of the parties involved.  Even the requirement in the legislation calling for the nomination of First and Deputy First Minister was changed by the Secretary of State in the House of Commons to merely their indication.  Even that was not subscribed to.  Why should the parties keep deadlines?  The quotation I gave was the same briefing I got in private and in public to the effect this was the date and there was no going beyond it.  They were required to comply or else plan B would be put into effect.  None of this was done.  We still do not have an announcement on Sinn Féin's preparedness to sign up to policing.  Whereas the Taoiseach has just said he accepts in this particular instance that media interviews are a substitute for an unequivocal commitment in the Chamber of the Assembly, which is somewhat unusual — I accept he is dealing with unusual circumstances — he enters the caveat that this was of course provided policing was subscribed to.  We still do not have that, and neither has an announcement been tabled for an Ard-Fheis.  It is immensely difficult to know where exactly we stand.  As the leader of the SDLP said, it is about time Sinn Féin and the DUP synchronised their U-turns.  Until that happens we cannot be sure where the St. Andrews process is going.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I would love matters to be perfect, and Deputy Rabbitte's analysis is fair enough in that it is not all perfect.  There are a number of major difficulties.  The biggest one is that the DUP has taken the view it will not have face to face talks with Sinn Féin in the first place.  If such talks did take place, it could resolve a lot very quickly, but it will not happen in the circumstances we desire.  The next initiative is to move the Programme for Government Committee, which is useful.  It is not perfect, and that is not normally what happens.  Members on all sides of the House will appreciate the situation.  Imagine a post-election scenario where it was decided there was going to be a coalition of whatever make-up and the two parties at the centre of it decided not to talk to each other.  It would be unbelievable, but that is how matters stand.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I accept that, but that is the position.  At least we have moved to the Programme for Government Committee.  Dr. Paisley's intention is clear.  Perhaps it was not quite clear on the day.  I said it was not and in fairness to the good man, he clarified it three hours later.  Policing has to be dealt with.  Let us be frank: if policing is not resolved, Dr. Paisley and his party will be gone, as probably will many more, and then the resolution in the Act will have to be triggered.On the other side, this period could be used to enable the Programme for Government Committee to get down to work and it seems determined to do that.  Dr. Paisley will be the First Minister.  The Deputy First Minister is Mr. Martin McGuinness and they are prepared to work with the agenda of the Programme for Government Committee.  They will nominate their other Ministers on 14 March and take up duty before that.  Within the arrangements the British Government has designed, much of the work of the parties that will form the Executive, will be recognised as being in transition, with people getting on with their work in the meantime, albeit not holding a full brief, as I would have wished.  It is not perfect, but the 24 November deadline successfully triggered the St. Andrews Agreement, worked that into legislation and now, belatedly, the Programme for Government Committee is underway.  There are many other hurdles along the way we will just have to overcome.  However, the position is clearer than it was all year when we could not get them to meet in any format and did not know whether we would be able to deal with the two issues of policing and power sharing.It is my estimation that the DUP has answered the question, even if outside rather than inside the Chamber.  It is prepared to deal with power sharing.  Sinn Féin then has to answer the question, if there can be a resolution of the MI5 issue, which we are working to achieve as best we can,  I really believe the sooner that happens the better.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Yesterday in the greater Dublin area, the Christmas 2006 Operation Freeflow began.  Unfortunately for hard-pressed commuters, whether travelling on private or public transport, it was scarcely noticed this year.  It was more a question of operation no-go, as usual.  People neither arrived earlier to work nor home to their families.  As an example, as usual this morning, it took 30 minutes to get from Mulhuddart to the Blanchardstown roundabout, a grand distance of one and a half miles.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	163	Most movements observed in that time related to the moving arms of trainee gardaí, frantically trying to push the traffic forward, but there was nowhere for it to go.  Had the most famous stable in history been sited on the Blanchardstown roundabout, Mary and Joseph would have got quicker from Mulhuddart on their ass this morning than their unfortunate fellow travellers, all of 2,000 years later — and would have breathed fresh air all the way.  Had they tried public transport this morning, they would have found as little room there as they did in the historic inn.  In short it is a disaster, and what is true of Blanchardstown is true of the greater Dublin area.  As my Independent colleagues tell me, it is being replicated right across the State in different ways.Ministers, including the Taoiseach, are completely cosseted from this daily grind and do not appreciate that commuters are at breaking point, not because of the exceptional debacle we had last Wednesday on the N11, but because of the daily debacle they have to fight through.The Taoiseach must not patronise the House with his usual response to the effect that this is the price of economic success.  It is the price of 40 years of corruption of the planning system.  Far more insidious than the bribes in brown envelopes to council minnows is the domination of Governments — particularly Fianna Fáil Governments — by the ethos of utterly selfish land developers and speculators.  This includes people on the Taoiseach's watch over the last ten years to whom he has given carte blanche to put up tens of thousands of houses and apartments and walk away with obscene profits leaving new communities desperately struggling with an infrastructural void of horrific proportions.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Will the Taoiseach own up to the responsibility first of all, which would be a start?  Operation Freeflow had an effect ten years ago.  Today it is irrelevant.  Before our people have a collective breakdown induced by gridlock, will the Taoiseach introduce emergency investment and measures in the immediate weeks and months ahead?  Double the buses in the cities and the quality bus corridors.  Double the trains on such lines as exist and rapidly increase the extra lines.  Doing so in 2015 is no use.  When buses and trains are flying past gridlocked cars and bringing people to their destinations in a third of the time, then we will know that we have begun to resolve this horrific situation.  What hope can the Taoiseach offer hard-pressed people throughout the country who are mired in this infrastructural crisis?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	166	The Deputy has asked what can be done in the short term to cope with the enormous amount of additional traffic we have had in this city — about 800,000 more vehicles than we had some years ago.The Government has approved funding of €30 million for the purchase by Dublin Bus of 100 additional buses.  A large number of them will arrive in January, which is in the short term.  There will be a further upgrading of the garage facilities at Broadstone, as well as the new station at the airport, both of which will affect the Deputy's constituency.  Dublin Bus hopes to enter many of these buses into service by the end of January.The bulk of this year's expenditure is earmarked for the delivery of quality bus corridors, which are designed to reduce travel time for passengers, improve bus performance and improve the quality of the public transport experience.  Again, much of this has either already happened or is happening.  There will also be the proposed Dublin Transport Authority procurement of approximately 100 buses from the private sector to provide services on new routes, many of which will serve the new estates of west Dublin.  This is to be done by competitive tendering.  While I do not have the date for this to hand, it is part of the initiative to facilitate the entry of private operators by awarding franchises to operate buses for 15% of services, which the Government negotiated with the trade unions.The Dublin Bus fleet covers all of the areas mentioned by Deputy Joe Higgins and has been substantially increased and renewed in line with the commitments under the national development plan, thus reflecting the company's major role as the key transport operator.  While there are longer-term initiatives, the Deputy did not ask me to go into them.  I refer to projects such as metro west, the frequencies on the train line and the new stations in Dublin West, some of which will open shortly.

The Deputy is correct to state it is not as successful as it was a decade ago because of the volume of traffic.  This is particularly true in the Deputy's constituency because of the construction under way on the M50.  The Deputy is aware the M50 work is being conducted at a flat out pace and is well ahead of schedule.  However, while it takes place, there will be gridlock, particularly on wet days.  One can see the traffic volume increases substantially on wet days.

What is to happen to the tens of thousands of commuters who must cross the M50 to travel to and from work and who will be caught in a further incredible log-jam?  The Taoiseach still allows building to proceed without the infrastructure.  I welcome the Adamstown initiative for the new community there.  However areas such as Ongar and Tyrellstown, the fastest-growing communities in Europe, are left bereft.  For the past two Mondays, with other public representatives, I have attended public meetings in those communities.  On both occasions, they were obliged to travel for miles to get a venue because there is no community centre.  It is true that one of them has a €40 million hotel across the road.  The Taoiseach should know this because he opened it and is a friend of its developer.  However, when the residents asked whether they could meet there, the reply was that they could but that it would cost them €600 for two hours.  This is the extent of the Government's betrayal of new communities in terms of infrastructure.  The position regarding schools——

The Health (Amendment) Act 2005, which is intended to charge those who live in nursing homes, is now being applied to this vulnerable group, which will have a significant negative impact on their quality of life.

No. 11 deals with a serious issue, yet it is being rushed through this House and being referred to committee.  It refers to a decision by Ireland to purchase carbon credits to the value of €5 million from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the purpose of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol in the period 2008 to 2012.In essence, we have three ways of dealing with the Kyoto guidelines.  We can reduce emissions here at home, invest in projects abroad or buy carbon credits.  We would be much better off emphasising the need to reduce emissions in Ireland.

We are dealing with projects elsewhere but not cleaning up our act in Ireland.  We need to reduce emissions at home and we need to debate the matter in the House.

It merits a proper debate here in this Chamber.  It should not be referred to committee without debate.  The import of what is involved is considerable and we, as an island nation, have responsibilities in all of this to ensure that we not only give utterances of support, but demonstrate it in a practical way.  The buy-out clause in terms of the carbon credit fund is simply not acceptable.  We need to meet our responsibilities under Kyoto in all respects and a full debate here is absolutely necessary.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I agree that this is an important matter.  There should be a full and open debate on it in the House.  If the Government had pursued a different policy over the past five or six years it would not be necessary to resort to carbon trading, which does nothing at all for the environment.  It merely shows up a lack of action on the part of the Government, which did not act sufficiently on alternative energy over the past five years.  I would agree entirely with the call for a full debate in the House on this important matter now.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I agree with colleagues that this matter should be debated in the House.  It is proposed to refer this for consideration by the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government tomorrow following which there would be a 20 minute debate on Thursday morning.  Perhaps a way to deal with this would be to extend the 20 minute debate on Thursday morning to allow the House an adequate debate.  Twenty minutes is not sufficient.  As far as I am concerned, if there were a commitment from the Taoiseach to extend the debate on Thursday morning, then this issue could be dealt with by the committee tomorrow and debated in the House on Thursday morning.

I wish to ask the Taoiseach about progress on introducing legislation on the sale of alcohol.  Does he believe that the legislation introduced so far has reduced the level of alcohol abuse by young people and the associated problems?  Does the Taoiseach agree that we need to examine this matter seriously?  Virtually every major sporting event is sponsored by an alcohol company and we do not seem to have got the message through.

Will the Government provide time to debate the serious revelations from that report concerning high level collusion?  Will the Government accede to the demand for a public inquiry?In light of the Taoiseach's acknowledgement of the importance of the debate on carbon fund mechanisms, when will the promised legislation, referred to as the APACE Bill, be introduced?  No publication date has been announced for the Bill, which refers to electrical contractors, but we also need standards for other contractors putting in solar panels and geothermal wood-pellet burners.  There is a considerable lack of regulation in this area.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I move:That, pursuant to Standing Order 125, it be an instruction to the committee to which the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2006 may be recommitted in respect of certain amendments, that it has power to make provision in the Bill in relation to the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992 in relation to the preparation of the register of electors.The motion before the House concerns an amendment to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2006.  The amendment is not directly related to the issue of votes for prisoners, which is the main purpose of the Bill, but is a further measure to help ensure that this year's electoral registration process is as effective and comprehensive as possible.  The need for revision of the electoral register has been discussed in this country for some years.  Local authorities have legal responsibility for the electoral register and it has been clear for some time that the registration process did not receive the attention, priority and resources that it required.All political parties have been long aware that the electoral register has not been as accurate as it should be and over the years efforts have been directed towards facilitating people getting on the register.  However, less attention has been paid to removing people from the register who should not be on it.  Until this year we did not have a system in place for removing from the register the names of people who had passed away.The problems with this approach have been compounded by the enormous changes in Irish society.  These include increased population mobility and unprecedented new development — we expect 90,000 new homes to be completed this year.  There has also been a huge increase in the number of non-nationals living in Ireland — almost 300,000 people from the ten new EU member states came to work in Ireland since May 2004.  We all know the dynamics of population change in the country.A number of commentators estimated that the register could have contained an excess of names ranging from 300,000 to 800,000 or more.  When we went to the polls in 2002 the number on the electoral register exceeded the number of adults in the population by about 300,000.  While there may be debate about the quantum, there was no debate about the need for serious revision.These problems have not arisen overnight and are not unique to Ireland.  The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance stated:Voter registration is the most complex and controversial and often the least successful part of electoral administration.  By its nature it involves collecting in a standardised format specific information from a vast number of voters and then arranging and distributing these data in a form that can be used at election time.Against this background a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007-08 register were put in place this year.  Additional funds were provided, a common set of guidelines agreed and a publicity campaign undertaken.  I discovered, at the beginning of this process, that local authorities did not have a common approach to compiling the register.  This has resulted in the most serious and sustained effort ever to improve the register, a registration campaign unprecedented in its extent and its intensity.More than 1,500 fieldworkers carried out nationwide house to house calls, tens of thousands of households were visited more than once and where these visits did not establish the composition of the households, councils were instructed not to delete people without first sending a written notice warning of the dangers of being omitted from the register.  As already mentioned the Government invested significant additional financial resources in the process, specifically €6 million to supplement local authority resources and another €1 million in a national media campaign.  Public awareness of the electoral registration process has never been higher.  Councils are now automatically notified of deaths in their areas, which did not previously happen and my Department instructed every council to set up a checking system on its website.The results that emerged from this campaign are remarkable.  Figures supplied by local authorities show that some 380,000 names have been added to the register since February.  These are people who were not registered at their current address but have now been picked up by the recent campaign.  The registration process will ensure that thousands of people who would not otherwise have been able to vote will be enfranchised at the next election.In addition, there have been over 500,000 corrections and deletions since February.  Included in this figure are people who have died, those who have moved house, those who were on the register more than once, and those with whom the councils were unable to establish contact.  The occupants of this latter category, estimated at 170,000, or just over 5% of the population, have all been written to and councils are reporting a huge response to these notifications.I must emphasise that persons who are still not on the register continue to have a number of options.  This amendment gives people a further two weeks, until 9 December, to submit a claim to get on the register which means that people will have had from 1 November to 9 December to check and to get on the draft register.  After this point local authorities will have until 2 January to make corrections to the register.  County registrars will have until 12 January to make changes to the register and interested parties have a legal right to be heard in this regard.  People may get on the supplement to the register up to 15 days before polling day.  Nobody is being disenfranchised and every voter who wishes to get on the register between now and the 15th day before the general election may do so with relative ease.There was no alternative to this approach in the short term.  It was suggested, in good faith, that using the PPS number system or the census could have created an easier path but there are practical problems.  The PPS system holds over 5 million numbers and does not necessarily capture voter residence.  The census is a mandatory requirement on all citizens and it would not have been possible to run two collection processes simultaneously.  It is subject to a seal of confidentiality between the State and the citizen which cannot casually be legislated away after the event.  While superficially attractive, these suggestions would not have worked, at least not in the short term.I believe we need to look at reform of the whole electoral process, not just discrete elements such as registration, voting systems and electoral expenditure issues.  Most democratic states have an independent electoral commission to oversee these issues and this is a subject to which I would like to return with the joint committee in the near future.  I am pleased that there appears to be a growing consensus on this across the House.The amendment in respect of which the Bill is being recommitted today will ensure that maximum use will be made of the time remaining, before the current register expires, to further improve the draft register.  The relevant registration dates affected by the amendment are set out in primary legislation and, in line with recent case law, any change therein requires change in primary legislation.  It is not possible to change primary legislation by ministerial order, even in a small matter like adjusting a date.The current law allows claims for correction to the draft register up to 25 November.  Following consideration of these claims, county registrars must return the endorsed list of claims to local authorities by 23 December.  A final register must be published by 1 February by the councils.  The effect of the amendment will be to allow more time for councils to complete their work and additional time for members of the public to submit claims for corrections to the draft register.  I recently discussed the issue of a time extension with the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government.  I stated I would consider sympathetically any requests from local authorities for an extension to the time limits.  I had not received any such requests at the time but on 21 November I received requests from three of the 34 registration authorities, two of which were notices of motion from elected members of the councils in question, while the other was from the management of the council in question.  Rather than confine the extension to the three councils concerned, I decided to provide an extension of time to all councils to complete their work on the register.  This is in line with the suggestion made at the joint committee.  In these circumstances, I also decided to give an additional fortnight to members of the public for submitting corrections to their council.A number of dates in the Electoral Act 1992 must be changed to give effect to the new extended timeframes.  First, the deadline for any person wishing to make a claim for a correction to the draft register has been extended from 25 November to 9 December.  Second, local authorities must prepare and forward the list of claims to county registrars by 12 December as opposed to 30 November.  Third, county registrars must return an endorsed list of claims to local authorities by 12 January.As a result, local authorities will have until 2 January to carry out their own amendments to the draft register.  The final date for the publication of the register for 2007-08 will remain as 1 February and will come into force on 15 February as normal.  To do otherwise would create a lacuna in which the only register available would be that compiled in autumn 2005.  In law, the current register ceases to have effect on 14 February next.  No one is arguing that the life of that register, which was compiled in the autumn of 2005, should be extended.  Such a suggestion would be illogical given the results of this year's campaign and the large number of errors on the register.  I have proposed the maximum possible extension within the limits of the life of the current register.The registration process this year has had more resources and more attention than at any time in living memory.  More resources and personnel have been dedicated to the task than ever before.  The object is to ensure that those who are entitled to vote are registered and no one is disenfranchised by the process.  The amendment will provide further assurance in this regard and give councils extra time to ensure they do a comprehensive job.  It is my pleasure to move the motion.

During the course of this Dáil, the only significant intervention made in this regard has been on one side of the argument, namely, on behalf of the Government.  Without listening to Members on this side, the Government's hubris was evident in its decision to plough ahead and buy electronic voting machines for more than €50 million.  These machines are now kept in cold storage at an annual cost of at least €1 million.Perfecting the electoral register has occupied minds for some time.  The Fianna Fáil Party has been in power for 16 of the past 20 years and if ever the electoral register was in a mess, it is under this Minister.  He only needed to examine the position in Northern Ireland where, according to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland:From 2007. . . the Register published on 1 December 2006 will be continually updated using information obtained from electors.  Any person who is eligible can register at any time and many will be contacted by the Electoral Office as a result of information obtained from government bodies (such as DVLNI, NI Housing Executive and Rates Collection Agency) regarding changes of residence.  Updates to the Register will be published on the first working day of each month and a revised version of the Register will be published on 1 December each year.The authorities in Northern Ireland have got the system right.  It avoids electoral fraud while allowing for the names of voters, for example, those who have died or new residents, to be added or removed from the electoral register.  It is beyond the capacity of the Government to introduce a similar system here.The Minister should be embarrassed that he requires a special hour-long debate to pass amendments he should have brought before the House in the legislation.  He did not listen to members of the public, Opposition Deputies or Fianna Fáil Party Members who requested during the Committee Stage debate that he extend the deadline to allow local authorities to sort out problems they had encountered.  During that debate, I referred to County Roscommon where letters to electors did not issue before the draft register was drawn up, with the result that thousands of people are probably still receiving letters indicating that their names have been removed from the register and they will lose their vote if they do not respond quickly.The register is a mess because the Minister did not listen and refuses to learn.  The Government needs to pass control of the electoral register to an electoral commission.  The recent political rows and debates on this issue would not have occurred if it had seen fit to give an organisation such as the Referendum Commission responsibility for managing the franchise, voting system and register of electors.I have tabled amendments on Report Stage of the Bill providing that a person who reaches the age of 18 years and is or shall be, on the qualifying date, a citizen of Ireland and ordinarily resident in the relevant constituency shall be automatically registered as a voter in the constituency referred to.  These amendments should be accepted.On Committee Stage, the Minister provided a long document outlining the reasons personal public service — PPS — numbers could not be used for the purpose of the electoral register.  The authorities in Northern Ireland use the equivalent of the PPS to compile their electoral register.  The Government has failed to introduce an honest and fair method to allow citizens to have their names placed on the electoral register and cast their vote without problems or doubts arising regarding electoral fraud.The Taoiseach publicly supports the Minister, arguing that the system is fine when the contrary is the case.  The Minister stated it is easy to have one's name added to the supplementary electoral register at election time.  Once the new register is issued on 12 February, those seeking to have their names added to it will be required to fill out a form and attend a Garda station where a garda must attest that they are living at the address indicated on the form.  The form must then be sent to the county council which must send an official to check the address.  These requirements were introduced for good reason, namely, to avoid fraud.  They would be fine if the register were correct but the register to be issued in February is not correct. The Sunday Tribune and Sunday Independent newspapers analysed the registration process and noted significant problems.  We will not be in a position to determine whether these are errors until the register becomes available.The comparative figures provided by the Minister indicate that the number of people on the electoral register in County Louth increased by more than 3,000 since the last register was taken, whereas in the adjoining County Meath the number of names on the electoral register fell by more than 20,000 in the same period.  Something is seriously amiss in one of these counties.  Given that both are important growth areas on the periphery of Dublin which have experienced significant influxes of population, how could the number of names on the register increase by 3,000 in County Louth and decrease by 20,000 in County Meath?  Either the register in the former has been stuffed with fraudulent voters or the register in the latter has not been compiled correctly.  Officials in County Louth inform me they employed 43 enumerators to check it and they are satisfied it is accurate.  The figures published in yesterday's Irish Independent, however, show a significant variation between counties.Clearly the problem is that there is no central control of the register.  Until there is an electoral commission in place with statutory powers to run elections, to handle the register of electors and to examine issues such as electronic voting and the voting machines there will be problems.The Committee on Electronic Voting has been disbanded so we have to rely on the Minister's good offices to test the machines.  We are concerned about this but it is happening because the Minister refused to listen and the Government believes it owns the system.  Fianna Fáil has been in government for 18 of the last 20 years but it now believes it owns the whole country, the voting machines, the voting system and the electoral register.The Government has not listened to us but democracy is a two-way process.  The Opposition spoke about electronic voting, pointing out the problems we faced, and we also spoke about the electoral register.  I am not saying the Minister does not have good intentions.  He set out to tackle the issue but the end result is worse than the initial position.  There are deep concerns about this process that will become apparent when people find they are not on the register.  If 5,000 people in Fingal find they are not on the register in the run-up to the election and they apply for inclusion on the supplementary register, the council must visit where they live, but there will not be enough time to do that.  That is the mess in which we find ourselves.The Minister cannot extend the deadline for inclusion on the register by two weeks unless we amend the Bill.  We do not oppose the amendment but it is too little too late.  The Minister said it is not possible to extend the deadline beyond December but he should ask the Attorney General to re-examine this and extend the period until the end of January.  Whatever date is chosen, the register would then be final.  That would give everyone a chance to ensure they are on it.  Unless that is done, and I acknowledge the procedural difficulties, there will be a catastrophe.  That is what the media tell us and it is what the figures show.We must take control of the register from the Minister and give it to an independent body if we are to tackle this problem.  If he is returned to office, the Minister could read out a clear guide from an electoral office for Ireland, which will ensure the register is updated monthly and anyone who wishes to be included is included.  That will not be possible under this system and there will be an awful lot of confusion in the run-up to the general election.The election results will be open to legal challenges.  If I apply for the supplementary register, how can the council know I will be there when it sends someone out to check?  If there are 5,000 addresses to check in some constituencies, it will be a major problem.  Those who have properly tried to be included on the supplementary register will not be on it.  Seats have been won and lost by a handful of votes and this election will go to the wire.The Minister has made a mess of this and the Government has acted in an arrogant and unacceptable manner.  The problems are now coming home to roost and people are angry.  It is time, even at this late stage, to extend the deadline to at least the end of January, the difficulties it may cause for administrators notwithstanding.The day has gone when local government authorities can look after the register.  They do not have the necessary databases or knowledge.  Many local authorities have no local charges to allow for the construction of such a database on households.  The lists they use are out of date and it is not their job anyway.  An independent authority should be established to register people automatically in conjunction with an agency such as An Post, which delivers mail every day.  An Post knows where people live and should be allowed to deal with this in future.  It is time for local authorities to move away from the issue because in counties with significant population increases, they do not have the time or resources to ensure an accurate register.  This is a mess and it is the Minister's fault.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	307	The motion asks permission from the House to bring in last minute legislation to deal with a mess created by the Government, particularly by this Minister.  The amendment we are being asked to allow to be debated tonight is so late that its request to extend the deadline dates for registration must be backdated to 25 November.The irony is that the amendment the Minister is now asking the House to give permission to introduce is the same as the proposal the Labour Party made less than four weeks ago that the deadline date for registration should be extended.  The Minister refused that request three weeks ago and continued to do so until last week when, belatedly, he was forced to introduce this amendment to extend the deadline date by a period of two weeks.It is not the first time the Minister has acted belatedly on this issue.  He spoke about the problems with the electoral register as if it was a problem that was the creation and responsibility of every party in this House, but that is not the case.  The problems with the register derive in the main from the way this country has developed in the past ten years, coinciding with the life of the present Government.  We are repeatedly told that one third of the country's housing stock has been built in the past ten years, and that is so.  That is why we have a problem with the register.  Those houses were not visited by local authorities and the register was not updated for those dwellings.We have seen changes in the past decade in the ways in which people live and work.  Someone calling to a house now may not get access.  It might be a gated community with an electronic code key-pad to allow entry to apartment blocks.  Even if he or she gets past that, residents will be out at work or collecting their children from a crèche.   The problems, therefore, in compiling the electoral register have increased in the past ten years.In addition, the local authorities facing the largest problems in compiling the register in the country's fastest growing areas are the same authorities that are stretched with the taking in charge of housing, provision of roads and sanitary services and planning problems.  I know this is the case because I raised the issue with the Minister a year ago when I became aware that a local authority, Kildare County Council, had requested additional resources from the Minister to update the electoral register and he had responded by refusing.The problem with the electoral register did not happen overnight.  It was documented in a series of articles in The Sunday Tribune and it was an issue that I raised in the House on behalf of the Labour Party, which proposed that the census process could have been used to update the register.  This was dismissed by an arrogant Government.  It claimed it could not be done and that it would interfere with the privacy and confidentiality of the census process.  This need not have been the case.  All that was required was that the census enumerators would be given an additional form which they would use to update the names of the people who were entitled to be on the electoral register and return that form to the local authority.  This suggestion was dismissed.A Private Members' proposal introduced by the Labour Party in the earlier part of this year included a proposal that PPS numbers might be used.  This too was shot down by the Government.  When confronted with the incontrovertible evidence that the register was totally out of date, the Minister ended up sending, in many cases, the very same census enumerators who had been out in April to retrace their steps and to redo or attempt to redo what they could have easily done much more efficiently in April.  The result, as we now know, is that a new problem has been created.  A total of half a million names have been removed from the electoral register, 380,000 have been added and 170,000 that it is believed are people who are normally entitled to vote have been deleted from the register because they were not at home or they did not respond to the letter.  These are people who, if they do not get back on to the register, will in many cases turn up at polling stations whenever the general election is called, only to be told that their right to vote has been removed from them.When the Second Stage of this Bill to extend voting rights to prisoners was taken in the House, I suggested to the Minister that the problems of the electoral register should be dealt with in this Bill.  He would not hear of it.  I tried again on Committee Stage but the Minister similarly would not hear of it.  Here we are now at the eleventh hour with a proposal to extend the date to 9 December and this must be backdated to 25 November as if we had never been talking about the electoral register for the past number of months.This is coming from a Government whose contribution to the electoral process over the past number of years was the daft, irresponsible and reckless waste of €60 million of taxpayers' money on buying an electronic voting system that we cannot use.  These were the people who were so keen to be the great modernisers in Europe of electoral law and processes that they went off harum-scarum to buy an electronic voting system that cannot be used and which the Commission on Electronic Voting has said in no uncertain terms is unreliable and wide open to abuse.  The Government could not even keep the electoral register accurate and could not assemble an accurate list of people entitled to vote.I recall the Taoiseach at the time of the controversy over electronic voting poking fun at the Opposition, saying that we were not keeping up with the times.  He said they were using it in India and why could we not vote electronically.  What is his contribution to the issue of the state of the electoral register?  It is to say that the claims about the electoral register are nonsense.  He specifically stated:There are still some people who did not answer the door when people called and did not answer the letters.  If people refuse to check the website and listen to the ads that have been plonked in the media for weeks and do nothing, there is nothing you can do.  You cannot force them to go on the register.In other words, the Government's failure has now become, according to the Taoiseach, the failure of the hard-working people in this country who were not at their door when the person from the local authority called because they were out at work or they were stuck in traffic getting home from work or they were collecting the children from the childminder or were too busy with their daily lives to deal with this issue.  The Taoiseach and the Government are out of touch with the reality of the lives of people in this country.I welcome the proposal to extend the date to 9 December because I have been calling for an extension for some time.  However, it is not good enough.  One of the reasons it is not good enough is that the information which those of us who are engaged in the political process, those of us in political parties, rely on has not been made available to us.  I thank the Minister for accepting the principle of the amendment even though he has his own wording for it.  The Labour Party proposal is that the Data Protection Acts will not be used as an obstacle to a list of the deletions being compiled.The problem is that the Act will be amended to allow for the compilation of a list of deletions but by the time we get it, we will not be able to use it because the date of 9 December will be upon us.  For that practical reason, if for no other reason, I ask the Minister that when we come to deal with the detail of the amendment, to extend the date of 9 December as this does not give sufficient time for us to make our contribution to the updating of the register.  I regret that we are in this eleventh hour situation.  We have another mess which has been created by a Government which has really lost the run of itself.I listened with some amusement and some sadness to the many speeches that were made at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, the general tone of which was that nobody can run or govern the country but Fianna Fáil.  Any of us would make a better job of this than they are making.  None of us would have ended up in a situation where the electoral register, the basic document on which our democracy is founded and run, is in such a sorry state as it is now.  The belated attempts being made to put it right are resulting in new problems which the Government is only belatedly coming to even recognise, much less resolve.

Even though the Minister accepted that request somewhat belatedly, it is still welcome and it will help to achieve a better register of electors for many parts of the State.The register of electors is an extremely important document.  Unless one's name is on the register of electors, one does not have the power to vote and if one does not have the power to vote, one has no say.I do not wish to simply hang the noose for the catastrophe of the electoral register around the neck of the current Government because it has been around the necks of successive Governments for some considerable time, going back to 1997——

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	314	The Deputy's party shares some of the responsibility for this mess.  The slide happened since 1977 when Jack Lynch abolished rates.  No correction was made and many Deputies now on the Opposition benches could have made it but chose not to do so.  It is spread around the place.However, this Government must take the lion's share of that burden.  It has been in Government for 18 of the past 20 years and it sat on the fence, particularly in recent years.  I make some concession to Deputy Gilmore's point.  The huge population shifts in recent years resulted in a crying need for attention to the register of electors, but this attention was not given.  Responsibility was left with the local authorities but this was responsibility without resources.  How could local authorities ever be expected to cope with the huge shifts in population?  The job was much easier in olden days when rate collectors visited every house in the State.Now that this has changed, a central agency with complete responsibility for the register across the State is absolutely essential.I get mixed messages from local authorities.  Some co-operate well with elected representatives in sending out and publishing their lists of deletions but others do not.  For example, a letter from South Dublin County Council in response to a request for the list of names of persons removed from the register said, "In this connection I wish to inform you that, based on advice received from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the council is not in a position to provide you with the requested information as it could give rise to data protection implications".  That is nonsense.  Why is there such a level of confusion among local authorities?  Are they messing around?  Is it someone playing God, or something close to it, with the register of electors and telling elected representatives to take a running jump?  It is completely unacceptable and demonstrates the need for a central authority to deal with these issues.There has been a significant increase in the register of electors in my Louth constituency.  While there have been more than 8,000 deletions, of which 3,035 were notable, more than 12,000 net additions have been made to the register.  I know there has been some innuendo as to why that might happen; I see the same is happening in Donegal.  I wish we could get to the bottom of it and sort it out rather than engaging in mud-slinging and innuendo.  It needs to be resolved.  I note that one polling station in Dundalk has had an increase of more than 37%.  However, when I examined the area I found that two substantial new housing schemes had been developed in the area.  This offered some explanation of why such an increase would take place.Some local authorities have visited libraries and other places to encourage people to check the register.  However, one could argue that libraries are the wrong venue as people visiting those tend to be literate and therefore up to speed with matters such as checking that their names are on the register.  One could argue that local authorities should have visited post offices and shopping centres where their presence would be more widely recognised and would have offered significant help and assistance to voters.While I welcome the legislation and acknowledge the extended deadline has been helpful, it could have been managed better.  In discussion with Deputy Ó Snodaigh earlier, I argued that one of the reasons in the past for lengthy lead-in times for registers of electors was their manual construction.  Nowadays registers can be checked by the push of a button.  More time could have been afforded to ensure this was done properly.  We will support this amending legislation.  I hope the Minister will undertake to establish a central agency with responsibility for the register in the not too distant future.The North was earlier cited as an example.  However, the North got it badly wrong and wiped hundreds of thousands of people off the register.  Luckily enough, my colleagues lobbied those foreign ministers who visit the place from time to time and they accepted the option and changed the register.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I welcome the deadline extension.  I also welcome that, for the first time, an attempt is being made to achieve a reliable electoral register.  I have highlighted this issue for as long as I have been a Member of this House, and that is quite a long time.  During the debate on introducing electronic voting, I said we would be better off spending our time and energy streamlining the electoral register than in trying to change the voting system.  This was dismissed with the casual arrogance that seems to go with some people in ministerial office.The Minister will know that I have raised the complete lack of a verification process regarding the creation of a reliable register.  This is quite remarkable in an age of such sophisticated technology.  To be certain, I contacted those in Dublin City Council charged with compiling the register.   They confirmed what we all know: they accept at face value all names and addresses submitted to them by persons who complete the relevant form.  There is no process for cross-checking or verification.  This might not be as serious as it sounds, other than we know that Members have been elected to the House by one vote, or just a handful of votes.  Governments have been elected on that basis, yet we have no verification process.  I also discovered that one cannot be added to Dublin City Council's parking permit list without producing four or five individual identification documents, including a utility bill as proof of address.I would like to continue at length but I am sharing time with Deputy Murphy.  I raised this with the Minister at a time when he could have done something about it, but he dismissed me out of hand with the same arrogance that Deputies Noel Dempsey and Cullen dismissed the argument during the debates on the introduction of electronic voting.  It is a great shame that something so essential to a fair and democratic process is being ignored.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	316	An accurate electoral register is the cornerstone of any democracy.  I doubt that the huge problems that exist with the current review will be dealt with in the next fortnight.  The failure to provide information on the deletions is a case in point.  The default position taken by some local authorities, including my own, is that if one is not listed one cannot vote.While the population of Kildare has increased by 20,000 in the past four years, the register is now smaller by thousands.  It is not a question of these changes being accounted for by people who died or by duplicate entries.  When one examines the register one will find that not every home in a housing estate has an entry.  For example, one will see entries for houses number one, number 13, number 25 etc., and the gaps in between clearly show that people are being excluded.  It is easy to see how this would occur in a constituency like mine where people are so time poor due to travelling to work times etc.  One in five people have been chopped off the register in Naas, Clane and Maynooth, while it is one in four in Celbridge.  Very little fieldwork was done in Leixlip for a particular reason.The online version is simply the draft register.  No one can check the online version for changes between now and February.  There is the possibility of doing something meaningful with this so that people can check if they have been added to the register.  The supplementary register requirements could be changed so that while identification is required, people are not required to go to Garda stations to be added to it.Everyone is entitled to be added to the register, but fieldworkers have told me that the variation in entitlements has not been properly scrutinised.  People who are only entitled to vote in local or European elections will now be allowed to vote in the general election.  This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed in its own right.I do not believe local authorities are the correct agencies to carry out this fieldwork any longer.  They do not have the relationship on the doorstep they used to have when the domestic rates regime was in place.  Using an agency like An Post, which has a direct daily relationship with householders, is a better way to deal with this.  We must learn some lessons from this.  Money spent on this exercise will be wasted if there is not an ongoing corrective process.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	317	There is no argument but that this is a bit of a mess.  One of the cornerstones of democratic behaviour has been called into question as we approach what will be a very important general election.  It behoves us all to ensure this mess is sorted out as soon as possible.  It also raises questions as to how many elections have been held on a near fraudulent basis.  As was mentioned, elections have thrown up unusual results.  Not only could future elections be challenged because of the way this is being handled but previous elections could be called into question given the system we have used to compile the electoral register.We need to move beyond a stop-gap, band-aid measure such as that which the Minister has been forced to introduce here.  We need to put in place fail-safe mechanisms and technology exists that may allow us to do that.  We need to put in place procedures on how we identify residents and citizens.  A proposal made by my party and supported by others is the use of personal public service, PPS, numbers that would allow people to be registered and would allow for their movement around, in and out of the country.There are other structural faults the Minister has, to date, been unwilling to tackle.  Each local authority is given responsibility for compiling the register but each has a different standard and approach.  In my constituency and in many others, the register is compiled by two local authorities.  In some constituencies, it may be the case that more than two local authorities are involved.  The lack of consistency in approach raises further questions.Deputy Catherine Murphy raised further doubts about the existing electoral register not only in regard to names inadvertently taken off it and names that remain on it when they should not be there, but in regard to the different categories of people named on it for local, European Parliament, Dáil and presidential elections and for referenda.  Doubts exist because people are being wrongly categorised.  We are sowing the seeds for further questions.  We must address the fundamental problem before us.  We must put in place technology that can properly identify citizens.I do not agree with the approach of the Labour Party in regard to the census.  I accept some of the argument the Minister made in that regard.  I see a role for the Central Statistics Office outside its census activity.  The ability to address this problem lies within the public service.  However, I question whether there is the political will and the means to put in place the resources to tackle this problem.  Many of us who have been involved in electoral politics for some time will have seen the abuse of electoral registers — for example, people registered as living in houses which were not occupied and family members being registered while no longer living in particular houses.  In addition, there are questions about the value of the document each of us seeking election to this House and to elected bodies must use.On these grounds, the Minister is being forced to introduce a measure many of us believe does not even scratch the surface of what must be done.  He should be willing to take a more collective approach to ensure this problem is dealt with systematically.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I thank Deputies and would like to take up a number of the points made.  Turning to Deputy Boyle's contribution, I have said several times that this must be taken out of the political maw and that we need an electoral commission that will take over the totality of this.  I agree with the comment that this should not be an issue for one side of the House.  I would welcome a debate in that regard.Incidentally, I also commented in precisely the same way as Deputy Boyle on the probable impact of all this on previous elections.  We must remember that in 2002 the electoral register on which we were all elected had one third of a million more people named on it than should have been named.  As was said in some of the argument and analysis subsequently, the electoral register here has been out of kilter by as many as 860,000 people.  My calculation at the early part of this, which is a matter of record, was that there would be of the order of 300,000 to 400,000 errors on the register.  The names of more than one quarter of a million people were not on the register whose names should have been on it.  As it happens, there were half a million people in respect of whom there were deletions and corrections.  At least 300,000 plus of those should not have been on the register, including tens of thousands of names of people who had passed away and whose names were not removed from the register.  In the city of Waterford, the names of 1,400 people who were deceased were still on the register.  I regard that as a scandal and that is why far from being either obstructive or difficult, I am the first Minister ever to take this matter on.  No Minister has ever taken it on because it has been regarded as a hot potato.  Everybody knows that once one gets into the job of correcting the voter register, one must get into the area of deletions which make politicians unpopular.Deputies Catherine Murphy and Morgan referred to field work.  It has been a challenge for local authorities and it has been difficult for them because of the sheer volume of change.  A most cogent argument in this regard was made by Deputy Gregory.  Far from being blind or deaf to the point he made, I agree with him and I will return to that point.  On this occasion and for the first time ever, central government funds have been made available to the local authorities specifically to do the job on the register.  I am delighted with the consensus emerging in this House that we need to look at the role of local authorities.  The position in law — I am not shirking responsibility in this matter — is that local authorities are responsible for this job.  They have argued with some validity that the job is massive and they have had a problem with resources.Deputy Boyle made a very valid point about the inconsistency between local authorities.  I am not sure if the Deputy is aware of this and I am not faulting him but before this process was undertaken, I sat down with the county managers' group to identify the problem with the inconsistency between one local authority and another.  Deputy Boyle is quite right in that the distances between local authorities is stunning.  That is why this year, before this process started, and before I got funding for the local authorities, I also changed the guidelines.  For the first time ever, remarkably, we had a consistent set of guidelines.I will take up the positive points, although there will inevitably be a little point scoring and who could blame us.  I would do the same if I was on the far side the House.  Deputies O'Dowd, Morgan, Catherine Murphy, Gregory and Boyle touched on the issue of some central format.  We will have to commit to moving to an independent electoral commission and I have said that several times.  The electoral commission will have to handle all aspects of this, including the boundaries, the construction of the register, the basis on which the register is constructed, the voting system, the form of voting used and, to go back to Deputy Gregory's point, the form of voter verification.  I have more difficulty registering for residential parking in my local authority than I have getting on the register.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I have been an advocate of a rolling register here.  Regarding whether we could use PPS numbers, if there was a simple way of converting the 5 million plus PPS numbers, which are not sensitive to addresses, to a voting register, it would be done.  However, there is no simple way of doing that without a massive change in the way we do our business.  Returning to Deputy Gregory's point, PPS numbers would certainly be useful as a means of verification, but they are not the simple solution to creating the register.  Allow me give a figure that illustrates this.  In the period since 1 May 2004, some 295,171 people from the ten new EU member states have joined the workforce and got PPS numbers.  PPS numbers are not sensitive to their address as they move around.  Some lived for a while in County Kildare, but now they are in Wicklow and we all know this happens.  It is not a question of being obdurate or difficult, but of dealing with reality and choosing the best way to do the job on this occasion.I agree with Deputy Boyle and I am amazed there has not been a challenge previously on the basis of the inaccuracies of the register.  Excellent work was done in The Sunday Tribune by Messrs O’Flynn and Coleman and if their figure of 800,000 inaccuracies was correct, it was a scandal.  Even if the figure was my lower estimate of 400,000 plus, it was still a scandal.  That is intolerable and that is the reason we are making the effort to amend the register through this Bill.  I am grateful for the support of the House in extending the dates.Deputies Gilmore and Catherine Murphy raised the issue of data protection.  I regret the decision made on data protection and do not understand the logic of it.  I do not understand how Deputies Crowe and Rabbitte were refused access to the register.  They did not want the information for anything other than to assist democracy and they should have been facilitated.  I am pleased to accept the amendment on that issue and have strengthened it.Given we must issue the register by 15 February, it is not practical to postpone its issue until March or later.  On 14 February, the existing register goes out of date and it would be wrong to allow a lacuna to build where we would have a day where we would not have a register other than the 2005 register.  I will make it clear to local authorities that Deputies will have the right, up to the time of the electoral court and the time the county registers sign off on the register, and the opportunity to put forward their lists.I have noticed, although it was not mentioned in the debate, there has been a disproportionate amount of deletions in some local authority housing estates.  This is reprehensible because the specific guidelines sent to local authorities advised they should not lightly strike off electors living in council estates, particularly as they will accept rental from these same people the following week.  I noted this myself and have sent out a circular advising local authorities to pay more attention to this matter.To return to the point made by Deputy Catherine Murphy, when Members get the opportunity to see the registers, they will see superb field work was done in many areas and much trouble was taken.  However, in some areas the field work may not have been so good.  Where there is a disproportionate amount of deletions in a specific area, I have asked local authorities to pay particular attention.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The Fine Gael and Green Party amendments repeat amendments which were debated extensively on Committee Stage.  Deputy Morgan's amendment, which has been struck down, related to much the same issue.  These amendments may be summarised as the provision of information and assistance for the prisoner in the registration and in the voting process.  We had fun with this on Committee Stage when we discussed cell to cell canvassing.We must bear in mind that we need to strike a balance between providing for and facilitating, as much as possible, the prisoner's right to vote and the need to maintain an orderly and appropriate regime within our prisons.  The proposed amendments should be considered in the context of the approach being adopted to support and promote the provision of practical information and assistance.Section 5 of the Bill already requires local authorities to give public notice of the availability of prisoner postal voting.  Under this section, application forms must be made available by the local authority, including in every prison.  These forms will contain appropriate explanatory information as to what needs to be done.  Complimenting this, it will also be possible to arrange for appropriate posters to be devised advertising the new arrangements for the prisons and for leaflets to be made specifically available through the Prison Service.It is the case that prisoners must receive information on their arrival in prison.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that guidelines would be issued to ensure we have a common approach in this regard.  Library facilities in prisons are an important focal point.  Prisoners have access to a wide range of media and they have access through their families and organisations representing prisoners.  To the greatest degree that is practically possible, the Bill allows for information to be made available.The issues raised by Deputy O'Dowd's proposed new section 6 and Deputy Cuffe's proposed new section 8 relate to information and assistance.  The relevant official in the prison will have an important role in helping the process and further informal arrangements may well emerge at local level.  It is not necessary or appropriate that we place a direct role on the relevant official, or the Prison Service generally, beyond that already specified.  It is specified in the Bill that there will have to be designation of a specific official.  Overall, the arrangements being put in place are more than adequate to ensure that prisoners will have access to both information and assistance.My Department will collect data on the number of prisoners taking up postal voting, which will provide a basis for monitoring the process.  It would become quickly evident, particularly as prisoners' rights organisations will also be very interested in this aspect, if there was, for example, a disproportionate under-registration in any prison.  That in itself will operate as a reporting mechanism.For those reasons, it is not prudent for me to accept the amendments.  This is not because I wish to be difficult or obdurate but because sufficient devices are already in place.

However, there has historically been a serious problem with the numeracy and literacy of a significant number of prisoners.  In that context, perhaps those staff involved in education in the prison might be able to assist in this area.  While I do not want the Minister to be prescriptive on this issue, it is important that those involved in education in the Prison Service would address this issue and that part of the curriculum would deal with it.  Staff within the prisons, who would not be seen as administrators, such as chaplains, might usefully become involved.One issue raised on Committee Stage was the question of the oversight of this process within the prison system.  While I accept totally the integrity and professionalism of prison officers and governors, there should be another presence, although not one who is in control or in a position where he or she could be placed in physical or other danger.  There should be a verification process and a signing off of the process so that it is as the legislation states.  In that context, perhaps an official of a local authority could be placed within the system, although not in a position of physical danger, so that there would be an independent verification of the process in the interests of transparency.  I do not doubt the integrity of the process but wish to avoid criticism or other issues.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Amendment No. 26 seeks to have responsibility placed on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in co-ordination with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to ensure that it is the responsibility of the Prison Service to ensure that registration forms and ballots are available to people in prisons.  I am concerned that if responsibility for the provision of ballot papers and the process is not tied down, there may be a void between these agencies.  There could be a metaphorical scratching of heads, looking at one another and wondering who is actually responsible for making this happen.I am disappointed the Minister does not intend to address amendment No. 9 which seeks to ensure that if prisoners were not in a position to prove their previous ordinary residence to the satisfaction of the registration authority, they would not have the right to vote.  Many people in prisons come from a homeless background or from a background where they were moving from house to house and simply did not have what would be considered a permanent residential address.  I am concerned that such people are not catered for in the Bill.  They would stand to lose their franchise — their right to vote — on foot of their previous circumstances.  It is most unfortunate the Bill does not deal with this serious issue, which applies to a considerable percentage of the prison population.I ask the Minister to consider amendment No. 9.  While it was suggested it was not discussed or dealt with on Committee Stage, I contend otherwise.  However, I will not labour the matter as it is not properly before the House.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Deputy Morgan has cleverly slipped the matter under the door.  He is correct.  The relevant official in the Prison Service will be at deputy governor or governor level so there will be responsibility over this process and, for example, there will not be a situation where the local authority does not send out forms and they end up in the bin.  It is a serious matter.To return to Deputy O'Dowd's earlier point with regard to monitoring, one of the best indications as to whether a prison offers this facility will be if a disproportionate number of people are not registered.  For example, if there is a large registration in one prison but not in another, that will be an indicator.  I have great sympathy with the point made by Deputy O'Dowd.  To make people accept part of the responsibilities of citizenship is very positive in terms of education and the development of the person.There are 200 whole-time equivalent teaching posts in the prisons and the prison education service will play a major role in this area.  It would be over-prescriptive to prescribe this in law.  However, I would expect and will ensure that a communication is issued to ensure the work is done properly.I ask the Deputies not to press the amendments as the issues have been dealt with.

I am advised it is not necessary to include a definition of "registration authority" in the Bill as proposed, although I understand the Deputy's intention.  Section 18(2) already provides that the Bill when enacted is to be read as one with Electoral Acts 1992 to 2005.  These Acts include the appropriate definition of regulatory authorities, and it is in these Acts that the definition is captured.  It is captured particularly in section 6 of the 1992 Act, which refers to city and county councils.  It would be unwieldy if we were to always repeat definitions and use the collective construction provisions, as in section 18(2).My advice is that as this is already captured in the other legislation, and as this legislation is to be read as one with the Electoral Acts 1992 to 2005, the desire of the Deputy for clarity in this regard is captured.  If the Deputy's draftsperson considers this point it will be seen that the collective description captures the definition.

A person can become an Irish citizen, or claim Irish citizenship, in a number of ways.  Such a person might never have lived in this country.  If someone arrives at Dublin Airport with a stash of banned substances in his or her suitcase and another prohibited substance in his or her pocket, and he or she is then detected, arrested, duly lodged in prison, charged, found guilty and imprisoned, the only time when he or she will have been resident in this country will have been the period he or she spent in prison.  The person in question will not have established any prior residency here.  In such circumstances, it would be unwise to give criminals a right that is not enjoyed by law-abiding citizens who are not resident in this country.  It would be odd to create this right simply by reason of residency in prison.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 4, line 20, to delete "place" and substitute "constituency".This amendment arises from a submission that the Labour Party received from the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  The submission drew my attention to the possibility that many prisoners were homeless before they were committed to prison.  The Bill currently proposes to deem, for the purposes of registering those prisoners as voters, that they are ordinarily resident in the "place" where they would have been residing if they had not been detained in prison.  I seek to change the relevant section to provide that prisoners be registered in the "constituency" in which they would have been residing if they had not been imprisoned.  I am trying to make a wider provision for two reasons.  First, it will not be possible to deem that people who were homeless before they went to prison had been residing in a "place" because they will not have an address that can be used to show they were residing there.  Therefore, it is possible that people might not be capable of being registered if they were homeless before they were imprisoned.  Second, it may not be appropriate in some cases for people to be deemed to have been resident in a place prior to their incarceration.  For example, the prisoner may have been convicted of a serious offence, the victims of which are still residing in the place where the prisoner originally resided.  I am thinking about horrendous cases of sexual abuse involving members of families, for example.  It might not be appropriate, in the interests of the victims of the crime in question, for the prisoner to be deemed for the purposes of registration to be residing in the place where he or she is living, and to be registered at that place.  For the reasons I have mentioned, it would be better to give consideration to the prisoner's "constituency" rather than to his or her place of residence.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I gave a great deal of consideration to this proposal.  The Deputy's last point related to the use of the word "place" to refer to the place where the prisoner would have been residing if he or she were not in prison.  This amendment, which was discussed on Committee Stage, seeks to change the text of the Bill to indicate that a person will be deemed to be ordinarily resident in a "constituency", rather than in a "place".  On the face of it, the amendment seems to involve a relatively minor change of words.  A person who is in legal custody may be registered as an elector under section 11(5) of the Electoral Act 1992.  Such people are normally deemed to be ordinarily resident in the "place", as it is worded in the Bill, in which they would have been residing if they were not in detention.  The text of the Bill follows existing law.  It seems the word "place", as opposed to the word "constituency", has been used for the best part of four decades.Deputy Gilmore made a specific point when he referred to the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government had consulted the trust and was aware of its understandable concern that homeless people, in particular, might have difficulties in establishing their links to specific places.  Under the current system, such people face notable difficulties in engaging with the electoral process, regardless of the provisions of the Bill before the House.  One of the Bill's fundamental principles is that it will not designate prisons as places of ordinary residence, because that is not what they are.  The disproportionate effect that such a designation would have on certain constituencies would not serve democracy.  I am sure Deputy Gilmore would not intend to have such an effect.We need to consider the same question that we consider under the current system.  What is the best way of linking a particular homeless person with a particular place?  The only home a homeless person currently has is the place where he or she resides, not necessarily voluntarily.  This matter is best considered by the local registration authority and the relevant person.  People could be registered at the hostels and shelters where they were permanently or temporarily residing before they were imprisoned.  Current practice suggests local authorities adopt a flexible and common sense approach to this matter.  If a person who happens to be detained at Wheatfield Prison wishes to designate Wexford or Wicklow as their constituency because they are from such places or they feel some affinity with them, they can do so.Deputy Gilmore raised a related issue on a previous occasion, although he did not mention it this evening.  I refer to the good point he made about the need for documentation as proof of residency.  He asked how a prisoner who was homeless before he was incarcerated can be expected to have such documentation.  It is not necessarily the case that proof of address would be demanded in every case.  Given the circumstances involved, local authorities should be reasonable and adopt a common sense approach in these and other cases.  Guidelines will be produced in this regard as the best way of ensuring there is flexibility.  Other options can be considered if there is a need for documentation.  In the cases of homeless people living in hostels, I understand it is sufficient for them to produce letters saying where they were from.  I appreciate that Deputy Gilmore is anxious to ensure homeless people have the same rights under this legislation.  Nothing in the Bill as it stands is contrary to that wish in any way.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I am disappointed the Minister has not agreed to accept the amendment.  I foresee that there will be practical difficulties in this regard.  As homeless people do not have addresses, we cannot know the addresses at which they will be registered.  When the Minister speaks again on this amendment, perhaps he will indicate whether it is intended to require that any given prisoner will be on the register on the basis of his or her home address, and with a "P" — standing for "postal vote" as opposed to "prisoner" — marked beside his or her name.  If that is the case, it will not be possible to register homeless people who are prisoners because they do not have addresses.  I would like the Minister to address a second aspect of such an approach.  The home address of a prisoner who is a sex offender, for example, could be the house in which the victims of the sexual offences in question are still living.  In such circumstances, the victims might not want the prisoner to be registered at the home address.  As we know, the electoral register is used by people who send out all kinds of mailshots.  If correspondence addressed to a sex offender comes through the letterbox of the victims, that might give rise to concern and upset within the household.  I will summarise my queries.  How will people who were homeless before they were sent to prison be registered, in practical terms?  What facility, if any, will be made available to the families of prisoners who simply do not want them to be registered at the home address?

I understand that if a person does not want to be registered at an address, he or she can be registered at a certain street — such as West Street in Drogheda — without the number of the house on the street being mentioned.  One does not necessarily have to be identified by a specific location.  One could opt to be on a street and not necessarily have to be at the address, but I would like clarification on that.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I see the point the Deputy is making.  Deputy Gilmore made the point that if an offence had been committed and a family did not want one of its members registered at that address the local authority would have to work out an appropriate way of registering the person.  In the case of a prisoner who does not have a previous address or who is homeless, the association will be at some hostel or some place where the person lived at some stage.  It will be difficult for the local authority to find out the address of people who cannot remember their last address.  If a person says he is from Wexford, it will be up to the local authority to try——

That flexibility could apply.  I am more concerned about the other point made by Deputy Gilmore.  He is worried about two things and one of them is the problem with homeless people registering, but practical arrangements can be made in that respect.  His other concern was about someone who might be put in jail for incest.  It would be an embarrassment to the family that the person would be registered in the family home.  The address to be listed would have to be another place where the person might have been residing.  The Deputy made a good point and I have not given a particularly coherent answer.  I will look at how that issue can be dealt with in the guidelines.  It is better to do it there than in primary legislation.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I wish to speak on amendments Nos. 17, 20 and 22.  Amendment No. 17 is aimed at people who have difficulty in proving identity.  If they have problems in producing identity, then surely the registration authority should rely upon the information that the Irish Prison Service has on prisoners' identity.  That is reasonable because I do not suspect that there are hundreds of people in prison under false identity.Amendment No. 20 seeks to extend the period, from seven days to 28 days, to allow a prisoner obtain information from outside.  The Irish Prison Service allows one statutory visit per month.  If the prisoner was to lose the privilege of additional visits, the one visit per 28 days would be a reasonable period of time within which to secure the information.  I know that seven days is the minimum and I accept the point the Minister made, but I would prefer to see the minimum set at 28 days just to be sure.Amendment No. 22 states that the registration authority shall rely upon the identity details of the applicant provided by the Irish Prison Service for the purposes of processing that person's application.  If a person is in prison under a particular identity, surely the weight of the deprivation of the person's liberty and the details provided the Irish Prison Service should be sufficient to satisfy the terms of the registration authority, especially if that prisoner is not in a position to secure other information.  There could be a breach from the family or the person may not even have a family.

It is hard to find peace and quiet in the new Ireland.  If it is not jack hammers, it is car alarms.  If it is not the roar of traffic from the bypass, it is the noisy party in the flat next door.  We need remedies that are timely, effective and simple.  The problem is that the current legislation is cumbersome, unwieldy and ineffective.One issue that comes up time and again in queries from constituents is noise.  It can be the next door neighbour, car alarms, the baying of dogs.  We have to introduce legislation that works in fighting noise pollution.  I was perturbed by the reply from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government two weeks ago, when I asked whether he had any plans to modernise the legislation on noise pollution.  He said that given the extensive controls on noise pollution from various sources, it was not proposed to introduce further legislation in this area.  The Minister is living in cloud cuckoo land if he does not recognise that there is a serious problem as regards noise pollution for many people today.The purpose of our noise Bill is to introduce a one-stop shop for noise pollution.  We want to tackle loud noise coming from building work, car alarms and barking dogs.  The purpose of the Bill is to simplify and enhance the system that protects people from forms of noise pollution that are being inadequately tackled by the current laws.  The existing legislation only deals with certain types of environmental noise and it involves an enormous range of bodies as well as the courts.  We need to put in place simple measures that work, that are timely and are easily accessible.  Our Bill provides a one-stop shop for noise complaints and gives local authorities real powers to stop noise pollution at source.  We are not reinventing the wheel with this.  We are looking at best practice examples, from London, Paris and around the world.  We are becoming a more urbanised people.  Many more of us are living in towns and cities.  We are living in terraced houses and apartments.  Life is becoming a misery for many of us because we lack the tools in law to tackle problem noises that are keeping people awake at night.  We need to modernise this system.All of us will have experienced problems with neighbourhood noise at some point in our lives.  Yet for some reason noise does not receive the same levels of attention as other forms of pollution.  It is only recently that the European Union took steps to compel local authorities to map noise pollution in municipalities.  We welcome this and see it as an effective step in realising and coming to grips with the scale of the problem.  However, we must place the obligation on local authorities to tackle such noise.  It is not good enough to just say something needs to be done about noise pollution.  We need to put in place clear easily accessible legislation that gives the ordinary citizen the power to tackle the problem of noise.At the moment the laws are inadequate and the system is very confusing for people who wish to make a complaint.  The forms are on the Internet and available from the post office or ENFO office.  One may put down a complaint and give it to the courts.  In the event, one has to wait two or three weeks for the case to come up, if one is lucky.  That is not much use if one is being kept awake with a young child at 3 o'clock in the morning.  We need to put in place measures that work at the same time that the noise is registered rather than waiting for the courts to come up with a remedy.  Not too many people can afford the time off from work, minding the children or whatever to go to court and to wait, hopefully, for their cases to be heard.  More often than not the case will be adjourned because the other side has not turned up.  That is not effective or clear and it is not working.We want, this evening, to point out that there are different types of noise, ranging from house and vehicle alarms, construction and animal noise, traffic and air traffic such as low flying helicopters which are often significant sources of noise pollution for many people in urban areas today.  All of these issues need to be dealt with at a single focal point.  We propose that the local authority should be the lead agency.We do not want the local authority to say, "Go and talk to the Irish Aviation Authority", or that the dog warden is dealing with something.  We want the local authority to be given the power to tackle this form of pollution.Under the existing law various agencies are responsible for dealing with noise from different sources.  Barking dogs are dealt with by local authority dog control officers, loud music by the HSE's environmental health officers, while the Irish Aviation Authority is responsible for noise from low flying helicopters.  We need to ensure that matters move quickly and that people have an effective remedy to hand.  We suggest that noise control officers are employed by local authorities to take immediate action once a complaint has been received.  They will have the powers to take action 24 hours a day, seven days a week, if necessary.  The funding for this, we believe, will be partially financed by the revenue generated by fines accruing from breaches of the legislation.We need to give people the effective remedies.  If there is a party with Michael Jackson playing at top volume at 3 o'clock in the morning, one does not want to have to go to the courts to deal with that.  One wants a noise control officer to turn up within an hour and warn the person that something will be done about the situation if he or she does not deal with the noise.  That is what happens in London and in other cities.  There are clear and effective remedies.  There are other long-term issues that need to be tackled, for example, the building regulations.  While they specify a maximum level of noise transmission from apartment to apartment, I am not convinced that the "as built" versions match what is said on plans.  Very often there are complaints from apartment dwellers that they are losing sleep at night because of the noise from next door.  We want both the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities to take a more proactive approach to the management of the building regulations.  Far more frequent inspections are needed and there must be clear data from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicating where the breaches occurred and what was done about them.   It is ridiculous if the Minister cannot give clarity as to what problems accrued from court cases involving breaches of the building regulations.In essence, however, we believe this Bill goes part of the way towards tackling noise pollution.  We are not arguing that it contains every remedy and we are handicapped by the fact that we cannot impose financial measures that would be a charge on the Exchequer.  The actions in our proposed legislation are discretionary rather than mandatory.  However, we believe that if the legislation is passed it will result in noise control officers being hired by the larger local authorities to control noise levels in large populations in urban areas.  This is about helping people whose lives are a misery due to noise.  Noise is often there on an ongoing basis and it is not so much the loudness as the persistence of the noise.  A small noise that persists week in and out from a next door neighbour, the air conditioning on the shop next door or the neighbours who turn the decibels up every weekend are examples of what need to be dealt with.  This legislation goes much of the way towards addressing the concerns that exist in this regard.We are not looking for the impossible but we believe that people are entitled to some peace and quiet.  That is the purpose of the Bill we are tabling this evening and I commend it to the House.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this Private Members' Bill from the Green Party.  I regret that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, having been in the Chamber for a number of other debates, has left for this one.  I hope he will read the debate and that he will have a chance to contribute later in the proceedings.  Alternatively, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport could relay many of the concerns expressed by my colleague when introducing this Bill.The legislation regarding noise clearly requires amendment.  It has already been argued clearly that inappropriate sound — which is what noise is — should be under the control of a single authority, rather than the current situation in which several State agencies are responsible for identifying and prosecuting its existence in local communities.  It is an instance of anti-social behaviour, which is all too prevalent in many communities, that local authorities could go a long way towards tackling if provided with the resources and legislative means.I recently had the privilege of attending a 40th anniversary commemoration by the Cork Deaf Association.  In respect of noise legislation, Members tend to forget that just as inconveniently-placed street furniture constitutes an intrusion on those who are partially sighted or visually impaired, the existence of any inappropriate sound for those who are hard of hearing makes life more difficult.  The need for stronger legislation in this regard was made clear to me at the aforementioned commemoration, which included a speaker from Denmark who outlined how changes had been made to Danish legislation and how ongoing campaigning continued in Denmark to improve their advanced legislation in this regard.  His presentation noted the existence on Danish public transport — and on trains in particular — of designated carriages.  Where there used to be non-smoking carriages, many European countries now have public transport carriages in which people are not permitted to use mobile telephones or other extraneous sound material.  This gives people the option of travelling in a better environment, particularly those with partial or impaired hearing.Another issue that must be raised in this debate is that for too long the legislation pertaining to noise has been concerned with the volume of a particular noise at a given time.  This debate should be concerned with inappropriate sound.  I refer to continual and persistent car and house alarms, as well as the noise from kango hammers.  Moreover, for many people who live adjacent to our ever-expanding road network, the sound volumes that can be reached simply by passing traffic — which is now practically a 24 hour activity — can be extremely difficult to live with.  I live next door to a road that is part of the inner city road network in Cork, namely the south city link road.  In recent years I have recorded noise levels from traffic there between midnight and 6 a.m., in excess of 100 decibels, which is far above existing permitted levels.  These are examples of simple quotidian noise with which people live.  I refer to the inconvenience of being woken up unnecessarily and to the cacophony associated with living with noise in one's garden or household that is not of one's choosing and over which one has little control.  Consequently, the need for this legislation becomes all too apparent.  The Minister of State or whoever will speak for the Government should articulate its understanding that the legislation under discussion is badly in need of reform.The real problem with the existing noise legislation is that it is virtually impossible to secure a proper prosecution regarding individual citizens' complaints because it is so cumbersome.  First, there is an obligation to have the volume levels recorded.  Members are aware that local authorities lack both the technology and the resources to properly record volumes on an ongoing basis.  Often, the requisite machines must be imported or leased on an ongoing basis.  While I am open to correction, I know of no local authority that possesses decibel recording equipment as part of its arsenal of matériel used to police the public realm.  They simply do not exist and there is too much reliance on other agencies and private companies to carry out such recording on behalf of local authorities.If complainants are sufficiently lucky to have their complaints accepted as having validity and to have the sound recorded, the law obliges the sound to be recorded on three separate occasions, namely, when the sound is at its highest, at a time deemed to be in the middle of the day and at a time deemed to be the quietest period of the day.  The latter is usually in the middle of the night.  When the existing legislation puts such an onus on individual citizens to prove the burden under which they live in terms of inappropriate sound, the Government must realise this is simple legislation that can be changed quite easily.  If the will exists, the House can act collectively to put in place some necessary changes that will improve the quality of many people's lives.This Bill is not concerned with the quality of sounds and I still wish to have the ability to play my Sex Pistols' CDs at an appropriate volume without disturbing my local neighbours.  It does not pertain to how people choose what constitutes good or bad sounds.  The current legislation determines that volume is the main basis on which people may use the legislation, albeit in a cumbersome manner.  There are good health and safety reasons for volume to be the key determinant.  However, as my colleague has already noted, the legislation should be broadened to encompass inappropriate sounds.  I refer to the persistence of particular sounds that have become part of the sound track — particularly in urban areas — of too many people's lives.  Unless Members are prepared to make such changes, I fear that public unhappiness regarding living in such a fashion might be translated into other types of activities.  As legislators, Members would not wish to see such developments in their local communities.It is curious that the first ASBO issued in Northern Ireland was to a person who was deemed to be playing his record player or CD player too loudly.  This legislation is not about that.  It pertains to the fact that in many communities, people who live in housing that is not effectively insulated hear the aforementioned sound track of urban life coming through their doors and windows.  I refer to heavy vehicles rumbling along roadways and to other sounds that might be linked to industrial installations.  These sounds are in addition to the type of sound track with which people in such communities live in any event.  Moreover, this legislation does not pertain to groups of young people hanging around street corners and engaging in boisterous activities.  It is to try to induce the Government to understand that a problem faced by too many people in too many communities can be solved easily through a simple piece of legislation.I accept the Bill requires further definition and would require passage through Committee Stage.  Deputy Cuffe is willing to engage in this process and since publishing the Bill, he has identified another section that could be added to this Bill on Committee Stage with regard to the sound threats posed by low-flying helicopters.  This risk appears to have arisen from the Celtic tiger.  On these grounds, there are compelling arguments for the Government to accept this Bill graciously.  It could be worked on collectively by Members and could be enacted to add to the existing legislation in this area, which Members have learned from experience is not effective and must be dramatically changed for the public to gain confidence in it.  This should be done in order that in future, individual citizens and communities who live with unnecessary inappropriate sounds can identify a route to remedy such problems and can seek quick and easy alleviation.  The Government should be prepared to respond graciously.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I wonder whether waffling Ministers could be included as a noise pollution effect.  While I do not refer to the Minister of State who is present, the idea would be interesting.I welcome this legislation from the Green Party.  While there are some who might be inclined to view this proposal as slightly amusing, it highlights what is a serious problem for many people.  There is substantial literature on the effect noise can have on people and it is a significant feature of anti-social behaviour.  One British survey found that nearly 10% of complaints about anti-social behaviour concerned domestic noise and that the cost of tackling these issues came to more than Stg£1 million per year.  The effects on those concerned included serious health problems as well as a general undermining of their quality of life.Public representatives and local authorities here will also have experience of complaints made about domestic noise and it is obviously a problem to be dealt with.  This proposal represents one such attempt.  At a basic level, every person should have the right to enjoy their own home space without noise interference from neighbours or other sources, including industrial plants.  The bottom line on domestic noise ought to be that no person should have to put up with interference from another which causes serious disruption to him or her.It is only part of generalised anti-social behaviour, which is a key concern for many people, particularly in urban areas.  It is interesting that when the mayor of Dublin last year established a consultation process with citizens on this, many of their recommendations were similar to my party's recommendations.  These included a much more prominent and long-term role for community policing and effective measures on the part of local authorities to deal with habitual offenders and persistent problems.  Sinn Féin in Dublin is currently engaged in a similar process and the response is much the same.What most people seem to want is a more visible presence by the Garda and that the Garda would be seen to be part of the community rather than a remote, and sometimes inaccessible, external agency that only appears in emergencies, if they are lucky.  There is a lack of trust between some communities and the Garda, based on a lack of understanding and contact.  Many young gardaí know little or nothing of working class communities other than those who offend and are often ignorant of the sources of many of the problems, for example, around drug dealing.An agency with the legislative authority to deal with noise issues there and then is what is needed.  This legislation is long overdue.  I welcome this Bill from Deputy Cuffe and the Green Party.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I wholeheartedly welcome this debate.  I am sure I am not alone in finding noise pollution and inappropriate noise probably one of the most frustrating issues brought to my attention as a public representative on a regular, if not a daily, basis.  It is frequently difficult to solve the problem.  All involved become frustrated and the system is undermined.  The reason is that the existing legislation is totally inadequate, confused, unclear and cumbersome.  No doubt the lack of a single agency to deal with the area of inappropriate noise is a serious problem in ensuring that something is done about it.I am satisfied that the current legislation is in need of review and updating.  The Noise Bill 2006 put forward by the Green Party should be a template for the Government to take on board and, through the parliamentary process and particularly the committee system, to expand and outline in more detail.  I hope the Government will take that view of this legislation because it provides an opportunity to once and for all take the issue of inappropriate noise by the scruff of the neck and ensure that something positive and effective is done for ordinary people who frequently find themselves in difficult circumstances as a result of noise.The Bill seems reasonably simple, fairly practical and, above all, workable.  If taken on board by the Government and by the Parliamentary Counsel, it could be fine legislation that would solve many of the problems in this area.  The key to the legislation is that the matter be the responsibility on a single agency.  In this case the local authority is identified as that agency.  The current position is that there are two, three, four or perhaps more agencies involved and people find it difficult to deal effectively with the matter.The Bill  provides for immediate action on the difficulties that arise with inappropriate noise.  The current lack of an immediate remedy is one of the most frustrating aspects of this problem for individuals affected by this noise and for politicians like me.  I am sure Members on all sides of this House find the entire process frustrating because it is impossible to deal effectively with noise.  The question of immediate action, which is vitally important, is addressed in the legislation.The Bill contains a section on barking dogs.  For almost 12 months I have been trying to deal with a problem concerning barking dogs.  This case has been kicked from Billy to Jack — from the dog control officer to the tenant liaison officer, the EPA and the courts — without a result.  This tenant involved will shortly turn the key in the local authority house door and go into private rented accommodation because he and his family simply cannot live with the situation for much longer.  I, therefore, welcome the section in the Bill dealing with that area.Construction is good example of another area in which there is need for the immediate action provision and for a single responsible agency.  While noise levels are generally addressed in planning permission, in an attempt to ensure a project is brought in on time developers are often prepared to carry on work out of specified hours, and involving noise levels exceeding those contained in, the planning permission.  They can only do that because there is no immediate or effective action to stop them.  Under this Bill, however, the local authority noise control officer could go to such individuals and within a short period could stop the noise.  We have all regularly come across cases where local residents complain about noisy developers working into the night.  When one tries to sort out the situation one finds that the noise has been continuing for two or three nights to complete a job.  The work was done quickly and finished in a couple of days but there is no immediate or effective action to stop it.  A noise control officer could deal with such situations as they arise, which is one of the attractions of this legislation.I would like to address a number of other issues but I will give way to my Independent colleague, Deputy Cowley.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I am glad to support the Green Party's Noise Bill.  Noise is defined as any unwanted sound which is a nuisance, would endanger human health, damage property or harm the environment.  In my experience, there are two or three noise-related matters which I would like to see resolved, but they cannot be dealt with due to the lack of adequate control mechanisms.  The first matter concerns blasts from quarries.  I have come across several cases involving damage to houses caused by such blasts, but nothing can be done due to faulty monitoring and inadequate legislation.  People have been frightened out of their lives by quarry blasting which has caused cracks in their houses.  Such explosions are supposed to be conducted under the auspices of local authorities but the regulations have not been properly enforced.Second, rock breaking continues around the clock in quarries but while people have adequate remedies in that regard, local authorities are not doing their job.  I have come across a number of such instances.Third, major noise pollution is occurring in a pristine, 400-acre footprint in Bellanaboy, County Mayo.  The sound of pile-driving there is certainly an unwanted nuisance.  It creates a terrible racket in an area where before now the only noise came from the twittering of birds or the howl of the wind through the glen.  Those sounds were much more welcome than the current nuisance going on in that area.  I would like to see the passage of legislation, such as the Noise Bill, to put an end to that pile-driving work, which is very unwelcome.  Those 400 acres will be taken over as the Government wishes, and as Fine Gael would also wish.

It is a lot of money which could do much for our roads.  It could do much for our country generally instead of going to places like Norway.  I do not begrudge the Norwegian people anything but they have gone further towards nationalising their natural resources than we have.  We have just given it all away.  Currently, there is no EPA legislation that can stop what is happening.  Those involved have not applied for any EPA licence so far.  We may be witnessing the silent theft of our natural resources.  What is being established there is a sub-sea system that will syphon all the resources away through a thin-gauge pipe.  Our future resources will disappear through a pipe to anywhere and everywhere except to those for whom it could be of real benefit, and for what cause?If we ever get that gas, we will pay the same price as if we were getting it from Russia, the United States or Norway.  We will pay the market price for it because that is the law governing the situation.  It is a great scandal.  The unwanted noise we hear from Shell's cheer leaders in the Government parties and in Fine Gael is trying to drown out the desperate cries of the ordinary decent people of Rossport.  It has to end.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to speak about this Bill.  I commend the Green Party for proposing the Bill to deal with the huge increase in noise pollution in our community.  Let us hope it has an impact and will give support to everyone who has had to put up with this situation.  Noise is defined in the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 as an unwanted sound which is a nuisance, would endanger human health, damage property or harm the environment.I wish to deal with some recent events that could have been dealt with under this Bill.  During construction of the Dublin Port tunnel, the residents of Fairview, Marino, Drumcondra and Santry had to put up with a lot of noise and disruption.  This commenced with disturbing noise coming from the huge tunnel boring machines, which woke children in their beds.  Toilets even moved during the construction phase.  To make matters worse, there are now 273 damaged homes and another 117 cases are awaiting resolution.  This has been ignored by the Government as the rights of local residents were trampled on in the name of so-called progress.  It is neither acceptable nor good enough.  I stand by all the residents affected by the construction of the tunnel in Dublin North-Central.  Even if it is not popular or fashionable to do so, I will stand with the residents on this matter.  The silence from the major political parties is deafening and the silence from the other Deputies in the constituency is an absolute disgrace.Section 3 of the Bill deals with complaints about neighbourhood noise at night.  The issue of anti-social behaviour arises and the noise and disruption caused to residents in this respect is not good enough.  Every Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday night residents of the Howth Road and surrounding areas must put up with noise, violence and disruption coming from the Bar Code centre at the end of the Howth Road.  I urge the council and the Garda Síochána to do something urgently before we have another Anabel's situation.  I do not say this lightly and I urge action to prevent serious injury or death in my constituency.  I am demanding action forthwith.Section 12 refers to noise from barking dogs.  I have received complaints about noisy dogs that are left unattended all day long and disturb people going about their business.  Meanwhile, night workers are unable to sleep during the day.  These mad dogs are barking day and night, waking up families throughout the neighbourhood.  Dog owners should have more respect for their neighbours.  This situation cannot be tolerated and, as legislators, we must do something about it.I urge dog owners not to allow their pets to roam the streets biting children, postal workers and even politicians.  I have been bitten twice by dogs while working in my constituency, which is very serious.  Two of my election workers were also bitten by dogs while doing voluntary work in the constituency.  A little more respect and manners are needed as a priority.  To resolve this matter, I had to buy a dog dazer which emits a high-pitched sound to distract dogs.

It sends out a high-pitched sound and can protect postal workers, politicians and political activists from dogs.  It is a valuable piece of equipment, which all Members of the Oireachtas should seriously consider using.  I understand that in the United States all postal staff are supplied with a dog dazer free of charge when undertaking their duties.  I have raised these issues because the legislation concerns noise pollution and related issues of public safety.Another issue that has arisen recently in my constituency, particularly around Clontarf, is the noise from jet-skis which emit a high-pitched buzzing sound.  It is unacceptable that young children are awoken by such noise at 8 o'clock in the evening in residences on the Clontarf Road and surrounding areas.  Questions of public safety also relate to these issues.  These are not trivial matters and I urge action before they get out of control.  The Green Party has been creative and radical and it is not the first time it has brought a sensible Bill before the House.  This is well thought out legislation and I urge all Deputies to support the Green Party's Bill because it will be important in dealing with noise pollution.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this Bill and to outline Government policy in this area.  Environmental noise arises from a great many sources, from large scale activities such as industrial installations, urban road and rail traffic and major construction sites to more local noise associated with security alarms, social activity and general neighbourhood noise.  Many industrial and commercial activities are no longer confined to traditional business hours and noise at night, especially between the hours of midnight and 7 a.m., can be very stressful for many people.Noise is a very individual issue.  On one side, some people tend to be naturally noisy while others are very quiet, and a significant majority falls somewhere between the two extremes.  On the other side, some people are very sensitive to all forms of noise while others are generally unaffected by the din of everyday activities.  Seeking to address environmental noise is ultimately a matter of balance and reasonableness.Environmental noise is a symptom of our very active and busy lifestyle that presents a catch-22 type situation in that we all need some quiet time to rest and recharge our batteries if we are to keep pace with family, business demands, and social activity.  In many instances it seems that social activities are more likely to begin rather then end at midnight.  Unlike other areas of environmental pollution on which we have developed a very definite and determined focus over many years, such as air quality, water quality and waste management, noise is something that has crept up on us to a certain extent.If time permitted, I am quite sure every Deputy in the House would be able to provide examples of noise issues for the purposes of this debate.  I fully understand the background to the Bill, my difficulty is that no context is presented in terms of the various provisions that already exist in law.  This is the appropriate starting point for any debate on environmental noise.Controlling environmental noise pollution is principally addressed through section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994.  More recently, the Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 give effect to EU Directive 2002/49/EC concerning the assessment and management of environmental noise. On foot of this legislation, local authorities have significant powers to address environmental noise.  These powers enable local authorities to intervene to prevent or limit noise in a wide range of activities and they have proved effective for many years.  An immediate area of interest in this debate is the opinion of local authorities on the effectiveness of the existing legislation and whether there are improvements that might be made from their perspective.In addition to the powers available to local authorities, individuals and groups of individuals now have access to an inexpensive and simplified legal remedy to noise nuisance under the 1994 regulations.  This allows any person experiencing noise nuisance to bring a case before the District Court for a nominal fee of just €18 and with no requirement to have legal representation.  As a general rule of thumb, non-domestic environmental noise issues are pursued by local authorities while domestic cases, such as issues between neighbours over anti-social use of radios, televisions and other sound systems, are a matter for the individual affected by the noise.  In such domestic cases, direct access to the District Court offers a simple and effective remedy.  To bring as much clarity as possible to the debate, I now propose to look at the existing legal remedies in more detail.Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to have measures taken to prevent or limit noise.  These powers are generally exercised in preventing and limiting noise from commercial and industrial premises within their functional areas.  Notice can be served by a local authority on any person in charge of any premises, processes or works, other than an activity which is subject to the integrated pollution prevention and control licensing system administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.  In the case of an activity that is required to be licensed by the agency, it is a matter for the agency to address all complaints about the activity, including those related to noise.The Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994 allows any individual or local authority to take a noise complaint to a District Court and to seek an order from the court to deal with the noise nuisance.  For example, an order might be sought to address a case of noise that is so loud, so continuous, so repeated, of such pitch or duration or occurring at such times, that it gives a person reasonable cause for annoyance.First, the person or local authority submitting the complaint must give notice to the person causing the noise of the intention to take the matter to the District Court.  The court will hear both sides and where it finds in favour of the person who made the complaint, it can order the person or body making the noise to reduce it to a specific level, to limit it — for example, to specified times — or to stop it altogether.My Department has produced a leaflet for the public providing general information about noise nuisance which also details the procedures to be followed when taking a case under the 1994 regulations.  The leaflet is available from the Department, ENFO, and from their respective websites.Noise nuisance caused by neighbours makes up the vast majority of noise complaints to my Department.  The source of the noise generally dictates the most appropriate course of action.  A key element in most neighbourhood issues over noise is whether the individual causing the noise is a private homeowner, a private rented tenant or a local authority tenant.If the person causing a noise nuisance is a private homeowner, the most appropriate course is for the person experiencing the noise nuisance to use the legal remedy provided under the 1994 regulations and take the matter to the District Court.  I appreciate that such a course is not suitable in every instance but it should not be overlooked as a simple and effective course of action that is available to everyone at a very modest cost.Since December 2004 all privately rented properties must be registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  In the case of noise nuisance being caused by individuals in private rented accommodation, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 imposes statutory obligations on landlords and tenants of private residential tenancies.  Tenant responsibilities under the Act include an obligation not to engage or allow visitors to engage in anti-social behaviour, which is defined as including persistent noise that interferes with the peaceful occupation of other dwellings in the neighbourhood.  The Act also imposes a responsibility on landlords to enforce the tenant obligations.There is provision in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 for third parties who are adversely affected by a failure on the part of a landlord to enforce tenant obligations to refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  If an alternative legal remedy is being pursued, such as the remedy provided for under the 1994 noise regulations, then the board cannot intervene.  It is important, therefore, for persons who are affected by noise from a private rented dwelling to examine both options before acting.Local authorities are empowered under section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of a tenancy agreement.  Noise nuisance is one of the areas covered under this legislation.  The tenancy agreement, the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions on the types of behaviour which are acceptable and not acceptable.  A person who is affected by noise caused by a tenant of a local authority property should raise the matter directly with the local authority in the first instance.Noise nuisance from domestic and commercial intruder alarms is one of the most noticeable problems and a common cause of complaint.  Generally, noise nuisance caused by an intruder alarm on commercial premises is a matter for the local authority concerned.  I have mentioned the extensive powers available to local authorities to address noise.Noise nuisance from domestic security alarms should be taken up with the occupier of the property in the first instance.  If this course of direct action proves ineffective — I am aware of how unaccommodating some people can be in matters of this nature — the matter should be pursued as a neighbourhood noise nuisance problem which should be referred to the local authority and, if necessary, the District Court.Noise nuisance from alarms has also been addressed through industry standards.  The new European standard, EN 50131, was introduced in March 2004 and incorporates considerably stricter controls regarding minimum and maximum durations for the sounding of external intruder alarms in buildings.  The minimum time is 90 seconds and the maximum time is 15 minutes.  Furthermore, from 1 November 2005, installers of alarms are required to register with the Private Security Authority and from 1 August 2006, installers cannot operate in the State without a licence from the authority.  For the purpose of obtaining a licence, applicants mush show they have attained the European standard EN 50131. In addition, I understand that the connection of monitored business intruder alarm systems to Garda stations is contingent upon, inter alia, the use of alarm systems that are certified by the National Standards Authority of Ireland and installed by certified installers.Noise nuisance from pubs and nightclubs is another common source of complaint.  The problem can be addressed by the local authority concerned or on foot of an application to the District Court by any individual or group of individuals.  A complaint can also be pursued through the licensing laws and should be brought to the attention of the Garda.The Control of Dogs Act 1986 consolidates, amends and extends the law relating to the control of dogs and contains powers to deal more effectively with the problem of dangerous dogs and general dog control.  A series of regulations was introduced under the Act, including 1987 regulations which prescribe the form of notice to be served on the occupier of a premises in which a dog is kept and where a person intends to make a complaint to the District Court regarding a nuisance due to excessive barking of a dog.  Recourse to the 1994 noise regulations is also available as a legal option.Outdoor events, especially during the summer months, are important to the social life of town and cities and, in some cases, the nation.  From a noise point of view, these events present local authorities with a new challenge.  For example, Dublin City Council reported that 2003 was an extremely busy year for outdoor events in the city.  The noise control unit of the city council carried out monitoring at a number of venues, including most notably the highly successful opening and closing ceremonies of the Special Olympics, both during the sound tests and over the duration of the events.  Furthermore, members of the unit are engaged at the pre-planning stages, liaising with promoters and organisers of events.  An important element of the city council's success in this area is the issuing of notices under section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 prior to all events.  A successful prosecution was secured for breach of a notice during one event in 2003.On noise nuisance caused by building or construction work, there is a common misconception that a specified statutory period applies during which certain works, for example, construction, road works and DIY, are prohibited.  While this is not the case, a planning authority may attach conditions to individual planning permissions for any development on a case by case basis.  These tailored conditions may include restrictions on the times at which construction work can be undertaken.  A person who experiences unacceptable noise from a construction site should, in the first instance, contact the local planning authority to ascertain whether any such conditions apply.  If no conditions apply, a local authority may still address the issue under section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 or the person affected by the noise may pursue the matter under the 1994 regulations.Part E of the 1997 building regulations sets out minimum requirements for sound insulation in buildings, including new dwellings.  Home Bond is carrying out a major study of sound insulation standards in Ireland and a number of other European Union member states.  The survey is due for completion by mid-2007 and it is intended to initiate a review of Part E of the regulations and the related technical guidance document in the light of its results and in consultation with the building regulations advisory body.

The 2006 environmental noise regulations, which entered into force in March this year, give effect in Ireland to EU Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise.  Environmental noise is defined in the regulations as unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activities, including noise emitted by means of transport, road traffic, rail traffic, air traffic and from sites of industrial activity.  The regulations are designed to address noise at a strategic level and are not intended to address domestic or neighbourhood noise.A two stage approach to the assessment and management of environmental noise is provided for in the regulations.  First, they provide for the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, for example, large agglomerations, major roads, railways and airports.  Second, based on the results of the mapping process, the regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned.  The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.The regulations provide for strategic noise maps and action plans to be made available to the general public.  They also provide for public consultation on proposed action plans and for the results of public consultation to be taken into account in finalising action plans or reviews of action plans.The Environmental Protection Agency is the national authority with overall responsibility for implementing the regulations.  At local level it is a matter for the local authorities concerned and Dublin Airport Authority, the National Roads Authority, Iarnród Éireann, and the Railway Procurement Agency.  As the regulations are implemented they will allow people who live in areas affected by environmental noise to have a genuine voice in influencing appropriate responses.  These regulations are a first step in addressing noise pollution at a strategic level and will deliver wider benefits over time.I hope this overview of the range of provisions already in place to address environmental noise will help to inform the debate over the course of Private Members' time.  Noise is a very individual issue and individuals on both sides of the argument — those causing excessive noise and those affected by it — can be unreasonable to varying degrees.  In many cases, a lack of thought about the impact of noise on others is the fundamental issue; in some cases there is also an element of unreasonableness on the part of one or both parties.  I am not convinced that further legislation is the answer but it is timely to look at the issues and this discussion of the Bill tabled by the Green Party is a welcome starting point.The Government will not oppose this reading of the Bill.  That said, the Government believes the proposed provisions therein are premature pending further consideration of the underlying issues in existing legislation.

I should add we have no difficulty with dogs because Fianna Fáil is dog-friendly.

Sadly, he changed his tune at the last minute.On behalf of Fine Gael, I thank the Green Party for introducing this Bill.  While we, like the Minister of State, have some reservations about aspects of the Bill, it is a worthy effort and we will vote for it with a view to discussing the details on Committee Stage.  That is what the Minister of State should have advocated.Anyone who lives in a built-up area knows the nuisance and distress noise can cause.  Car alarms, house alarms and building work at ungodly hours are par for the course these days, particularly with developers trying to finish estates at night.  Apartment life has greatly increased existing problems.  Poor insulation in new apartment blocks means the neighbour's burglar alarm is not just a distant irritant but a serious disturbance.  It is for those reasons we intend to view the Bill in a sympathetic light and we urge the Minister of State to do likewise, although he killed that hope in his speech.

#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Like so many areas in the environment portfolio, the Government has effectively washed its hands of the matter.The Department's website notes that 12 years ago the then Minister made regulations under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 whereby any individual, person or local authority may complain to the District Court to seek an order to deal with noise pollution.  The nuisance was defined as noise so loud, so continuous, so repetitive, of such pitch or duration or occurring at such times that it gives a person reasonable cause for annoyance.The process which the individual or group must go through to seek redress, however, is too tough in our view.  A complainant must give notice to the person making the noise of the intention to make a formal complaint to the District Court and then he or she must serve a notice on the alleged offender that a complaint is being made at least seven days in advance of that complaint being made to the court.  The District Court will hear both sides of the complaint and where it finds in favour of a complainant, it can order the person or bodies making the noise to reduce it to a specific level, limit it to specific times or stop it all together.  The process for doing that is far too long and cumbersome, it is like using a machine gun to swat a fly.  The courts should not be involved at all, we should be able to devise a system where a satisfactory solution can be reached without resorting to the time and expense of the District Court.The most recent move in the noise pollution area came from the Minister in April but it did not even refer to domestic noise.  The Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 dealt only with unwanted or harmful outdoor noise created by road, rail or air traffic or industrial sites.  While we welcome any regulations aimed at managing noise in urban areas and around major national infrastructure works, it is a remarkable oversight that measures to deal with the problems addressed by this Bill were not taken.The Minister said in April, "I know that neighbourhood noise nuisance is a serious problem in many areas, and a number of options already exist to address it".  Could the Minister clarify these comments in his response to the debate?  Is he happy with the current framework for complaints and does he think nothing needs to be done or does he now feel differently?  If so, what does he intend to do about it and when?The Environmental Protection Agency will have overall responsibility for the implementation of April's regulations but governance at local level will be a matter for the local authorities and Dublin Airport Authority, the National Roads Authority, Iarnród Éireann and the Railway Procurement Agency.  Part of the problem, however, with much of what the Government tries and fails to do is the lack of joined-up Government and the tendency for things to fall through the cracks because so many Departments and agencies are responsible.  I am concerned that the lack of over-arching responsibility will act against the proper implementation of such regulations and I am glad this Bill touches on the area by establishing a one-stop shop for noise complaints while empowering local authorities to do what needs to be done.I welcome the provisions in section 11 of the Bill regarding intruder alarms.  Far too often these alarms sound when there has been no intrusion onto or into someone's property and the din goes on for hours at a time because the property owner is not present.  Indeed, it is not uncommon for such alarms to sound for days on end while residents are on holiday.  The Bill states that external intruder alarms which remain activated after a 15 minute maximum will be considered unmonitored and may be removed on foot of a complaint to a noise control officer to cease the noise.  That is eminently sensible.As a party of rights and responsibilities, Fine Gael believes that being a good, thoughtful citizen is one of the most important duties of every individual and ensuring that neighbours are not subjected to endless noise is a part of that.  It is easy to programme an intruder alarm to ensure it does not disturb one's neighbour for an undue length of time but often people do not think of doing this.Section 11(6) states an alarm device fitted to a vehicle may be activated for a minimum of 15 seconds and a maximum of 90 seconds.  While this provision is welcome, if the Minister were to allow the Bill to progress to Committee Stage it would be possible to debate the 90 seconds time limit and the other provisions.  I favour a 15 minute maximum limit similar to the provisions in the Bill relating to home intruder alarms.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's or the Government's views on having two different maximum time limits.

It is a truism that wherever there are neighbours, there will be disputes.  New living and settlement patterns especially in apartment blocks mean that people live in closer proximity than ever before and this can lead to friction and disputes.  As legislators we should do everything we can to ensure that unreasonable demands from a neighbour are not unfairly entertained by local authorities.  Where there is a legitimate grievance, I agree that local authorities should be available to sort out the matter but not in cases where the complaint is driven by malice or spite, or bad neighbours.Fine Gael is also a little concerned by the provisions in section 12 relating to barking dogs.  While it is obviously not right to keep a hound in the back garden barking constantly, we must be careful to ensure that this Bill becomes more than an order to muzzle all dogs.  Fine Gael would also seek to amend the Bill relating to the provisions that where the local authority receives two or more complaints regarding the same dwelling or premises within a two-week period from the issuing of the notice, a fine of €100 shall be imposed.  It should be made more explicit in the legislation that the complaints would have to come from two separate households and not two complaints from the one person or household.  The complaint should be independently verified by an independent witness.On the issue of house and car alarms, I suggest we need to look beyond the issue of personal responsibility and instead concentrate on the type of products being put on the market.  The Green Party will be more aware than most of the campaign in Europe to eliminate the standby function on electrical items such as televisions and video recorders.  Leaving such machinery on standby is hugely wasteful and damaging to the environment.  It is up to us to fully switch off appliances and not leave them on standby.  It would be preferable if the standby function simply did not exist on such items.  While Fine Gael favours this Bill, manufacturers of these house and car alarms need to be compelled to build into their design an automatic switch off function which means the noise ceases when they are sounded and ignored.  This function should be installed on all alarms.  I would be interested to hear the views of the Minister of State on this issue.Fine Gael compliments the Green Party on proposing this Bill.  While we cannot support every provision we will be supporting it in principle at this stage and look forward to a vigorous debate later as suggested by the Minister of State.  It is to be regretted that the Minister of State did not allow this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage for debate.

Many people around the country will have more than a passing interest in its contents.  A person's home is his or her castle.  With all the activity and hustle and bustle of modern living, everybody to some degree experiences an encroachment on their private space, but the line has to be drawn on the degree of encroachment.  Many people will be interested in ensuring that the neighbours from hell syndrome is stopped.  There was nothing with which I disagreed in the Minister of State's speech except that when people look for help, they find it very difficult to get it.I know of one dog in one rural area which nearly drove the townland mad for a year.  There was a legion of people trying to nail him in one way or other, or to nail the owner, but between the dog and his owner, they won.  This is the sort of situation which makes many people fed up to the teeth, especially when they cannot get a night's sleep.  There seems to be no overall responsibility.I come from a rural background——

I refer to anti-social behaviour and louts who make noise at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.  This has been discussed in this House in various guises down through the years but there are more louts on the streets on Saturday and Sunday nights than ever before.  They are making more noise and they seem to be getting away with it.  If the Green Party Bill can put a silencer on those fellows, I am in favour of it.  It can be arranged and it is a matter of control.I will be surprised if in the rural areas of the Minister of State's new constituency a dog does not take a bite out of his heel at some stage.

I am far past the disco stage but I note the outrageous decibel level at weddings.  This cannot be good for young people's eardrums.  The Army deafness controversy would pale into insignificance compared to the damage being done to young people's ears.  It seems nothing can be done about this.  Planning regulations stipulate a control on the decibel levels, but in my experience of the few discos I have witnessed in recent years, the levels seem to be louder.  It could be argued that my hearing is going down but I do not think so.  There could be a significant health danger associated with these levels.  I also note people using MP3 players as they cycle, dance and mess around.  I understand that due to the volume of the earpieces they would not hear an airplane passing, never mind a car.  These are all noise problems that need to be tackled.  It could be argued that an individual should be allowed do what he or she likes.Noises can be appropriate to their locations.  What would be a real problem in one part of the country or in one set of circumstances, might not be so bad in another.  Those of us living in rural areas often welcome people who come to live in our area.  It is noted that such people can become very upset and hot under the collar if they hear cows lowing at night on the occasion when calves are being weaned and they are in for a chorus for two or three nights.  I agree this is not pleasant, but try telling the calves to stop.  If one is in a rural area, one must accept rural ways.There is also the issue of control.  A barking dog would appear to be a small matter to me, but it can be a serious matter to affected householders.  As Deputy McCormack said, it is a pity that something like this would have to be brought to the District Court.  The Minister of State described going to the District Court as a simple route.  It is not all that simple because many people do not like going to court if they can help it.  I would be surprised if there was not a simpler solution.  Most sittings of the District Court are jammed with cases involving anti-social behaviour.The encroachment of noise levels into the private life of the citizen has become a serious issue.  Let us consider the question of noise levels on construction sites.  In fairness to the current and previous Governments, efforts have been made to make such sites more pleasant and safe to work in, and that extends to noise levels.  However, the earplugs workers might use are not sufficient to drown out construction site noise.I do not know how soon this Bill will be discussed again.  It is an important aspect of living.  I hope the Government will take this issue seriously.  Whatever we come up with, whether that is everything that Deputy Cuffe has suggested or parts thereof, tonight's business has not been in vain.  I look forward to this issue returning to the House.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I congratulate the Green Party for introducing this Bill.  The Minister of State mentioned the various sources from which noise emanates.  At one stage of my career, I was chairman of a safety committee in a very noisy industrial installation.  At that time, the decibel levels were far above what was permitted.  Many of my colleagues suffered hearing damage.  However, this was before the time that people took legal action against employers regarding such matters.  We must recognise the work done by health and safety organisations in controlling noise levels and preventing hearing damage.One instance that highlights this issue is the experience of the State in the Army deafness claims.  This occurred at the same time as damage was being done in industrial and construction environments.  At that time, noise levels were accepted as a matter of life and there was no understanding or recognition of the damage it could do to people's hearing.  Some people were unable to hear conversations unless they were speaking on a one-to-one basis.Some Members have mentioned anti-social behaviour.  This issue has been raised with me regarding noise levels after weekend discos close in Newcastle West.  There is a considerable level of noise in residential areas in the town.  Gardaí find it difficult to control such behaviour when there is no apparent breaking of the law.  A gang of young men can create a lot of noise and wake up residents, particularly elderly residents.  The Bill will be more than welcome if it addresses this problem.  This is a serious issue and while people tend to tolerate it, it is unfair on those who must endure it.We have all come across the issue of dogs barking loudly.  It is specifically mentioned in the Bill, and the Green Party has qualified this by stating that an independent witness would be required to activate the involvement of the noise control officer.  A night-shift nurse living on a council estate told me that she cannot sleep because of the noise emanating from her neighbour's dogs.  I asked permission to report this to Limerick County Council, but she asked me not to as she did not want to draw attention to it or upset the neighbours.  An elderly couple nearby also raised the issue, but they too insisted that it should not be reported because of the upset and difficulty it may have caused.  That is unfair on those people.  I was in a dilemma over whether I should report this problem, but chose not to because I felt the finger would be pointed at the individuals in question.Some method of taking positive action with the council or noise control officers would be useful.   This does not only happen in local authority housing estates where some action can be taken, but it also happens in private housing estates where the council has no involvement.The Minister of State also referred to noise caused by urban road and rail traffic.  I do not know what can be done about such traffic.  It would be difficult to reduce noise on our main thoroughfares.  I presume the approach will involve limiting noise output from vehicles or reducing speed limits.  However, it would be contradictory to reduce speed limits when we are building highways.  When I was growing up I lived quite close to a railway and we found the whistle of passing trains to be quite attractive.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	413	There was confusion earlier in that a group of amendments is being taken together.  Amendments Nos. 7a, 15 to 17, inclusive, 17a, 18, 18a and 19 to 23, inclusive, are being taken together.  The group of amendments relates to section 4.The substance of the amendments was discussed on Committee Stage.  Section 4(1) is necessary so the registration authority can get the information required for it to perform the functions under law.  As I explained on Committee Stage, the bottom line here is that we cannot take away from the core objective of the section which is to ensure registration authorities can require the minimum information they need to do their job properly.  The issue before we adjourned was the amount of information they would require.I accepted the genuine concerns a number of Deputies expressed on Committee Stage and I undertook to discuss this issue with the parliamentary counsel.  Unfortunately, none of the Deputies who were present on Committee Stage are here.  I undertook to go to the parliamentary counsel to see if there was scope to devise an alternative formulation which would allow some greater flexibility in setting deadlines.  This has been done and Deputies will see the amendment I have tabled brings forward two new subsections — section 4(2) and 4(3) — which will be substituted in place of the original provision.The revised provisions clearly recognise that formal deadlines need not always be set and provide local authorities with the reserve power to set a deadline when the local authority considers it necessary in the particular circumstances of a case.  This is clear from the new subsection (2) and the use of the words "may specify" a deadline instead of the previous mandatory requirement to do so.  Where no deadline is set, it will be a matter for the prisoner to reply in the time he or she needs to given the circumstances involved.  This goes a long way to meet the concerns Deputies had about this issue of an inflexible time which could operate to the prisoner's disadvantage.I again make the point that I expect local authorities to set guidelines only when needed and when doing so to give the maximum time possible.  As I explained on Committee Stage, there could be times in the best interest of the prisoner that a relatively short deadline has been set.The concerns expressed by Deputies Cuffe, Morgan and other Deputies who contributed have been dealt with.  I ask the Deputies to accept the bona fides of amendment No. 18 which meets all the requirements put to me on Committee Stage and to withdraw their amendments.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I made it clear if the Deputy followed the point I made.  During the Committee Stage discussions, Deputy Gilmore raised a concern and wanted to delete the word "shall" which he said was inflexible and substitute the words "may be required to".  The general tenor of the discussion on Committee Stage was that it would be wise to try to introduce a more flexible arrangement.To answer Deputy McCormack's specific question, section 4(2) provides for the specification of a deadline but it gives councils the reserve power to set a deadline when the local authority considers it necessary in the particular circumstances of the case.  The words used are "may specify" a deadline instead of the previous mandatory requirement which stated "shall specify".  The idea is to give the flexibility which members of the Opposition, who raised this issue, sought.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	419	Amendment No. 27 is very interesting.  Amendments Nos. 27 to 30, inclusive, effectively cover the same issue and deal with the matter of automatic registration.  They raise very significant difficulties.  What is proposed is a system of automatic registration when a person reaches 18 years.  There is a problem with the amendment, notwithstanding the fact that automatic registration might be a good route to take.  Automatic registration is tantamount to compulsory voter registration, something we have never had.  While some people feel it might be good, the matter should be discussed in its own right before taking that route.  There are also other more cogent reasons to ask the Deputy to pause and reconsider the matter.Automatic registration, with an opt-out, as proposed in the amendments, is complex.  It is easy to contemplate, but difficult to see how it would operate.  For example, what would be the process of securing automatic registration?  I was born in Wexford, moved to Dublin where I spent many of my teenage and adult years and subsequently moved to various parts of Wicklow.  How would the process of registration follow me as I move around the country?  There is no requirement on me as a citizen, who has moved from one part of the country to another on various occasions, to register where I live and there is no process that could relate where I currently live to where I lived at the time of my birth.  Most of us were registered as being born in maternity hospitals.   While there is a certain attraction to automatic registration, there are practical problems.Another problem for a voter who has just turned 18 years of age is how he or she would know of the process in place to exercise the automatic opt-out.  Which registration authority would receive the automatic registration and how do we know that would be appropriate as young people move around quite significantly in their late teenage years and early 20s?  What procedures should young people follow who want to tell a registration authority they do not want to register and what timescale would be allowed for that?  A series of issues arise.I do not wish to be negative.  Deputy O'Dowd made the point that voter registration needs to be examined in a more holistic way.  Currently, we probably have the worst system of voter registration.  Our system goes back to the 19th century and is the responsibility of local authorities.  Some of these do the job superbly, some moderately well and some not well at all.  Some take it seriously, but others do not.  Deputy Boyle mentioned that in our system — it happens in his constituency — local authorities adjacent to each other adopt radically different procedures.It would not be practical to take this route until we have adopted a different system of voter registration.  It may well be we should adopt a different system.  I would not knock that.  The concept of automatic registration deserves discussion in that context, rather than here.  I am sure the amendment was tabled by Deputy O'Dowd with a view to airing that general point.  It would not be wise to accept the amendment as a series of practical questions arise from it.

It would not matter then whether young people moved from one area to another or whether they were born in one place and now live in another.  PPS numbers move with people wherever they go.  Could we not have a system where the register of voters would be linked to PPS numbers?We all agree with the Minister that the process of registering needs examination in view of the difficulties we have all experienced in our areas.  I welcome the extension of the window of opportunity for correcting the draft register until 8 or 9 December.  However, we must develop a system where we will have a longer time allowed for correction of the draft register.On the proposed amendment, I am convinced the Minister agrees something must be done.  If this amendment is not acceptable, what system will the Minister recommend that will allow automatic registration of people at the age of 18?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I am grateful to the Deputy for his remarks.  The Deputy asked about the use of the PPS numbers.  I have made the point several times that PPS numbers are primarily for use by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and were established for a particular purpose.  We have approximately 5 million PPS numbers in the country and approximately 3.1 million voters.  To convert PPS numbers to a voting registration system would be fraught with all sorts of difficulties, not least because PPS numbers do not necessarily reflect current address.  I am sure many Members who have a PPS number do not necessarily have their most up to date address recorded for it.I mentioned some of the problems associated with using PPS numbers earlier, probably when Deputy McCormack was not here.  Between 1 May 2004 and 1 November 2006 some 295,771 numbers were issued to people from the ten new EU member states alone.  PPS numbers are carried with the person from place to place, but they do not have to recognise where a person currently lives or whether the person is in the country.  The PPS number is, so to speak, the equivalent of a person's barcode and is not designed for that purpose.I do not wish to be negative on the issue of registration.  The Deputy asked what I think is the right way to go about the matter.  I think we need a rolling register, something which was mentioned by Deputy Morgan.  The resources currently going into producing what can at best be regarded as a flawed, sometimes seriously flawed, register, should be taken and invested into creating a rolling register.  As I said on Committee Stage, the PPS number could be very useful for verification when a person's name is being entered on the register.  For example, the PPS number is currently used when people renew their passports.  The idea would be to use it for the purpose of verification on registration.Also, if we had a system where PPS numbers were cleaned up and it was possible to use them for voter registration, we could also use the REACH system to allow people to vote on line.  However, the idea that we can have an automatic system where every 18 year old will be allowed to vote, without putting into operation a structure to manage that, is not viable.Deputy Morgan was right in the point he made earlier.  In the North of Ireland where insurance numbers, which are the equivalent of PPS numbers, are used, a massive and hugely costly effort was made to prevent electoral fraud, and the national insurance numbers were introduced for that reason.   There, they had to move to a system of a rolling register.  To pass this amendment without putting into operation the infrastructure required to support it would create major difficulties, not least the practical difficulty of in what constituency a person would be registered.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	422	In the context of the overall point of this Bill as it relates to prisoners, this amendment deserves particular consideration.  Our prison population is overwhelmingly under the age of 25.  Also, significant numbers of young people between the ages of 17 and 18 reach the age of majority and acquire the right to vote while in prison.  We need a mechanism to deal with their right to vote and participate while prisoners in the prison system.  Even though we are on Report Stage, does the Minister accept this is a particular that remains to be dealt with and which we need to revisit?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	423	The Deputy was not present when I dealt with this specific point.  The idea is that we would have a recognised official in the prison at senior level who will take responsibility for this issue and that, for example, the prison education service would have a specific role to play, a point made earlier by Deputy O'Dowd.  Deputy Boyle is correct that a disturbingly high proportion of the prison population is young people, but to introduce an automatic system for every person of 18 years to be registered before all issues are resolved, such as where they reside or what constituency they would be associated with, would be fraught with evident difficulties.  The problem the Deputy addresses, namely, the specific issue of getting young prisoners registered, is a matter that will be dealt with during the reception process, when their right to register to vote will be dealt with.

Does it matter where a voter in a presidential election lives?  A voter would not necessarily have to be attached to a constituency to be eligible to vote in a presidential election.  Can a distinction be made along the lines proposed by the amendment?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	425	Practical difficulties arise.  We clearly could not have a separate register for each different election.  There is no need to know a voter's address for a referendum, for example, but as the electoral register is difficult enough to construct once, to construct four or five different electoral registers would be extremely difficult.The idea of automatic registration or, for example, a system for tying it in to PPS numbers, or using PPS numbers for verification, are all issues that belong to a wider debate on the issue of how one constructs the register.  If, for example, one was to take on board the point I have just made, namely, that I would favour the idea of a rolling register with resources provided to make sure that rolling register is kept up-to-date and accurate, one could have a debate in that context.  However, one could not introduce the arrangement suggested in the amendment without creating chaos.

It is the nub of the work in this debate.  The amendment seeks to insert a new section that will allow additional time for councils to complete their work on the electoral register, which Members have welcomed, and allow members of the public more time to return their registration correction forms to their city or county council.  The dates are being extended to 2 January and 9 December respectively.  The amendment provides for a new timetable to apply in the case of the 2007 and 2008 register.Amendment No. 30a is a Labour Party amendment.  I have indicated I support the spirit of the amendment.  As Deputy Gilmore has explained, a number of Deputies, including Deputies Rabbitte and Crowe, sought to obtain lists of deletions and were not given these on the basis that there may be a problem with the data protection commissioner.  I have indicated to Deputy Gilmore that I accept the point.  Every Member of the House and every public representative should have had the list of deletions.  I am happy to accept the underlying proposal that will make it publicly available.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I am pleased to have an opportunity to move the motion, which allows Dáil Éireann to have a unified voice to express its concern at the continuing crisis in Darfur.  The motion itself sets out the range of issues which makes the situation in Darfur so grave and complex.  I wish to focus on a few key points and to bring the House up to date on the latest developments.  While the situation is very complex, the conflict has since 2003 caused huge social upheaval and human suffering, which I witnessed when I visited Darfur last July.  We cannot forget that basic point.Estimates vary but we believe at least 200,000 people have lost their lives as a direct and indirect result of the conflict.  Furthermore, more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes and livelihood.  Currently, 4 million people, two thirds of Darfur's population, are in continuing need of humanitarian aid.  Faced with so serious and dangerous a situation, the international community has focussed on three main challenges, first, bringing aid to the millions who need it, second, trying to encourage the parties to the conflict to cease their violence and reach a political settlement, and, third, creating and deploying an international peacekeeping force that is sufficiently robust, large and well-equipped to provide the basic security which is essential if the first two goals — the delivery of humanitarian assistance and working towards a political settlement — are to be achieved.As regards humanitarian assistance, Ireland has provided more than €16 million in aid to Darfur since 2004.  Total Irish Aid funding to Sudan in the same period exceeds €32 million.  I salute the courage and dedication of the UN agencies and NGOs, including those from Ireland, who work so tirelessly there.  The dedication of the mostly young people who work in Darfur is an inspiration to us all.  However, continuing violence and attacks on humanitarian workers are making it very difficult for agencies on the ground.  Mr. Jan Egeland, the UN humanitarian relief co-ordinator, warned the Security Council on 21 November that large parts of Darfur are seeing a meltdown of law and order.  He cautioned that the rampant insecurity was taking its toll on the delivery capacity of an increasingly beleaguered humanitarian community and warned that, if that trend continued, the situation in Darfur would spiral out of control.The shrinking space for humanitarian delivery is of great concern to the Irish NGOs.  Attacks that affect humanitarian workers are in direct contravention of international humanitarian law.  We are concerned about the safety of our own people, about the NGO community in general and about their capacity to deliver the assistance they are there to supply.The collective efforts of the international community to restore peace and security have not succeeded.  Successive ceasefires have been broken by all sides.  The Sudanese Government has failed to implement its pledges to disarm the Janjaweed.  A recent report by the UN's panel of experts monitoring the arms embargo indicates that it is being blatantly violated by all parties.While the Darfur peace agreement was rightly hailed as providing a comprehensive framework for the restoration of stability, it has been seriously undermined by the fact many major rebel groups have not signed it.  Little has been achieved in terms of implementation.  Both signatories and non-signatories have been intensifying their military activities.  AMIS has done a reasonable job in the areas in which it has operated but has been hampered by its small size, logistical and command and control shortfalls, lack of enforcement capacity and refusal of co-operation by the parties.Due to concerns about AMIS's ability to fulfil its role, the international community, including the AU itself, agreed earlier this year on the need for transition of this force to a UN mission.  On 31 August the UN Security Council authorised the sending of 17,300 UN troops and 5,300 civilian police to Darfur to support implementation of the peace agreement.  However, the resolution invited the consent of the Sudanese Government.  Since President Bashir remains firmly opposed to the implementation of this Security Council decision, it has not been possible to deploy a UN peacekeeping force.In an effort to unravel the current difficulties, the UN Secretary General and the chairperson of the commission of the African Union co-chaired a meeting of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a number of African states, including Sudan, in Addis Ababa on 16 November last.  It was agreed at the meeting that the UN and the African Union should within 15 days organise a meeting of the signatories and the non-signatories of the Darfur peace agreement with a view to reaching agreement before the end of 2006 on the amendments to the agreement which would enable the non-signatories to adhere to it.  The African Union's chief mediator for Sudan, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, is visiting Khartoum to move the process forward.  The 16 November meeting called on all parties to commit immediately to a cessation of hostilities.  In light of the regional dimensions of the conflict, Chad and Sudan were urged to stop the fighting along their common border in Darfur and to respect previous peace commitments.The meeting agreed to expand the UN's support to the AU mission in Sudan, taking into account the Secretary General's proposals for a phased approach to the strengthening of the peacekeeping operation in Darfur.  More significantly, agreement in principle was reached on the deployment of a hybrid AU-UN force in Darfur.  Some important issues remain to be resolved, however, including the size of the force and its command, control and reporting arrangements.  I welcome these developments, especially the agreement in principle on a hybrid UN-AU force.  Early acceptance by Sudan of the outstanding issues is essential, however.  Sudan will give its considered response at tomorrow's meeting of the AU peace and security council in Abuja.Although recent signals from Khartoum are not encouraging, I appeal in the strongest terms to President al-Bashir to endorse the agreement.  The UN Secretary General's proposals meet Sudan's criteria that the peacekeeping force in Darfur should be basically African and that the African Union should maintain a strong leadership role in it.  While there have been too many false dawns in this conflict for us to be foolishly optimistic about the present situation, we must never despair.  We owe it to the people of Darfur and their suffering to continue to support them and to work for a solution to their plight, no matter how long or difficult the path.  The Government will continue to offer major financial assistance to Darfur for as long as it is needed.  It will also continue to use all avenues and opportunities to highlight the crisis and to urge concerted action to resolve it.Last July, I was the first EU Foreign Minister to visit Darfur since the signing of the peace agreement.  I met the Sudanese Foreign Minister in July in Khartoum and again in September in New York.  Through bilateral meetings and letters, I have urged the leaders of key states such as Egypt, South Africa and Ethiopia to use their influence with Sudan.  It is essential that efforts to resolve the situation in Darfur remain at the top of the international agenda.  Ireland will continue to play a full and active role in these efforts.  I will continue to explore every avenue open to us.  In doing that, I know I carry with me the strong support of the House and the Irish people.  I am pleased to commend the motion to the House.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I am pleased this motion has been tabled in the House.  I thank my colleagues, especially Deputies Woods, Michael D. Higgins and Allen and the other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, who have contributed to the formulation of this motion.  It is an important milestone.  This all-party motion sends a clear message to the Sudanese regime that the people of Ireland are at one in their opposition to the war and the humanitarian disaster in Darfur.  Regardless of our political differences, we are uniting in opposition to the deaths of 400,000 people; the systematic use of rape as a tool of war; the displacement of 2 million people, 50,000 of them in the past four months; and the failure of the Sudanese regime to meet its clear responsibility to protect its people.In supporting this motion, I hope it will be followed by motions from all European national parliaments.  After the motion is passed, I will ask the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to contact its counterpart committees in the parliaments of our EU colleagues with a view to seeking the ratification of similar all-party motions across Europe.  I accept that our voice is a small one, but we must play our part.  A larger voice can grow from our small voice, expressing the anger and opposition of the people of Ireland and across Europe to the appalling crisis in Darfur.The United Nations and the African Union signed a memorandum of understanding on Saturday, detailing the additional assistance the UN will provide to the AU force in Darfur.  The UN support includes staff in public information, civil affairs, administration, finance, humanitarian co-ordination and mine action, as well as military staff officers and police advisers.  Communications and night vision equipment are also being provided.  The hybrid UN-AU operation will have about 17,000 troops and 3,000 police officers, which represents progress.  We wish the force well.  We hope its work translates to real peacekeeping action locally.  Mr. Kofi Annan has called the agreement a "turning point".  The world will hope he is right because the under-funded and under-resourced AU mission in place is not up to the job.I urge everyone who wants a real and credible assessment of the crisis in Darfur to read the monthly reports of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to the UN Security Council on the crisis.  The reports are available on the UN website.  The most recent report tells an appalling story, which is that the humanitarian crisis is worse than ever.  Humanitarian workers are being targeted for theft and attack, systematic rape is taking place and thousands of civilians are being displaced.  According to the Secretary General, the displaced civilians find little protection in camps where members of armed groups are committing rape, robbery and murder.The World Food Programme says that 355,000 people in northern Darfur were without food aid in July and August.  Humanitarian access is severely limited.  More than 100,000 people in the Jebel Marra area have been denied access to humanitarian aid as a result of militia attacks.  Aid agencies are providing assistance to 2.6 million people despite these outrageous attacks.  The International Criminal Court has stated in recent days that it is close to launching prosecutions against war crimes suspects in Darfur, which is welcome.  Just as we must hunt down the killers in Srebrenica and Rwanda, we must send out a message that those who commit similar crimes in Darfur will face punishment.Ireland has taken a tough position with the Sudanese regime.  I applaud the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has raised this issue time and again and is personally committed to doing all he can to relieve the plight of the people of Darfur.  He has visited the region, met his Sudanese counterpart and spoken to countless other governments about it.  As Members of the national Parliament, we must play a part by urging our constituents to lobby and be advocates for the voiceless innocents in Darfur.  Ordinary Irish citizens can play a role by writing to the Chinese and Russian ambassadors to pressurise Sudan.  If people want to write to the Sudanese President or to the various embassies, they can get the addresses from their local Deputies or from Amnesty International.  This motion sends a clear message that the Irish people are appalled by what is going on in Darfur.  This crisis is bringing shame on the world because we are watching while thousands die.  We must make our voices heard.  This motion is part of that process.I do not have time to speak in detail about the commendable report on the Sudan divestment task force, which was produced by the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa.  The Irish nation might look at how it can withdraw pension investments from companies like Total which are involved in Sudan.  Such actions will not change the world, but they will send a clear signal to the rest of the world that we stand for certain principles in the area of human rights.  This country should take a lead role in the well thought-out and strategic campaign of intelligent economic pressure.  I commend the campaign in question, just as I commend this motion to the House as part of that process.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I thank Deputy Allen for facilitating me, as I have another engagement.  I am happy to support this all-party motion on behalf of the Labour Party.  I commend the decision of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to visit Darfur so early and to remain engaged with the tragedy that is taking place there.  It is important that we recognise what is at stake in Darfur.  An enormous tragedy is unfolding in front of us.  It is a real tragedy of a scale that involves a significant level of loss of life, as we heard in the Minister's speech and in Deputy Carey's contribution.I would like to make some points that are equally challenging.  When people use the term "genocide", they usually define it in terms of what is the intention.  In this case, the intention is about occupation and dispossession.  What is happening meets nearly all of the characteristics of genocide in international legal discourse.  The issue is also raised of the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities and the lacunae that exist in international human rights law on such protection.  Human rights law is challenged by our action or inaction on Darfur.  The media and the public in many countries are interested in seeing, reading and hearing about the number of victims, but they sometimes do not see these minorities as the carriers of rights.The next important challenge is in regard to the United Nations.  The UN, moving in the direction of being active in the vindication of international human rights, has been stressing the nature of the concept of human rights protection.  Human rights protection is crucially different from human rights intervention.  In the case of human rights protection, it is the need of the indigenous people or the minority that defines the case for protection.  Human rights intervention has been abused over many decades as it is the intention of the invading force which is the defining moral justification.  We cannot accept any longer the suggestion that sovereignty can stand as a veil between the rights of people who are minorities or indigenous people.  Neither can we accept the suggestion that people can participate in horrific crimes with any sense of impunity.The proposal for the enhanced peacekeeping force, strengthened as it is by the most recent UN resolution, needs to be better resourced in the short term.  It is probably the best prospect for acceptability if increasing numbers are drawn from African neighbours.  It also needs logistical and financial support if it is to be able to sustain its activities.  There are other important issues and I do not want to underestimate the depression people feel now that both the signatories and the non-signatories of the southern Sudan agreement have factionalised, sometimes on personality grounds.  That is deeply depressing.  The international community must take a clear and unequivocal stand on the external context of this conflict.  Interested parties that seek to put their economic and commercial interests above the rights of those whose rights are so grievously being trampled upon, need to be shamed internationally.  The position of China on Sudan is simply unacceptable for a member of the international community that has begun to acknowledge, through its notional acceptance of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, the concept of international responsibility.The Darfur case shows the importance of accepting an indigenous definition of the notion of governance.  Governance must mean something that is rooted in people's experience and in people's memory.  There was a tragedy in Somalia, where the clan system was the best prospect of providing a mechanism that would stand against the two warlords in Mogadishu.  The clan system was rejected at the time of the Somalian famine.  It has been recommended by international scholars since then, but it has never been accepted.  If we are to see past the tragedy of Darfur, it will require addressing of regional issues, as the Minister's opening speech stressed.  It will also mean taking the concept of governance as something that is not to be imposed from outside, but something that is to be amplified from within acceptable local structures.  This is always more difficult and is slower to bring about, but it has a much better prospect of being accepted.At this stage, there have been calls for immediate sanctions on the Sudanese Government, including the divestment mentioned.  However, we must remember that the attacks on civilians, with the clear intention of dispossession and removal, qualify as genocide and justify intervention.  I regret to say that, but it is the case.  I also believe that the UN refugee camps for internally displaced people are no longer safe havens.  Women are in danger of being raped and appalling decisions must be made, such as sending older rather than younger women to collect firewood, in the desperate hope that they will be safer.  The duplicity of the Sudanese Government, which has clearly been involved with the Janjaweed in the attacks on villages, should be exposed for what it is.  Those people who have been captured and exposed are clearly operating with the direct and indirect support of the Sudanese Government.It is clear from population movements that have taken place that a kind of ethnic cleansing has occurred.  Half of the 6 million population has been devastated since December 2005 and 2 million people are in camps, and I do not know of any aspect of a definition of genocide or displacement that is not being met by these statistics.  I wish it was true that the May 2006 agreement was not in tatters.  However, it is sometimes suggested in the media that this is a religious conflict, but it is not that simple.  It is a conflict about resources and about the relationship and use of resources for different peoples with different identities in an international context.  That is why there are such powerful interests refusing to act or acting malignantly in regard to the conflict itself.It is important to state that the Minister and the Government have the support of all of us in the Dáil in seeking to take such steps as may be necessary.  There is a UK proposal for a regional meeting which would involve all of the interests, conditional on the acceptance of the President of Sudan.  In the preparation for such a conference, which would address all of the issues on a regional basis, if some prospect is offered as the first phase of a desperate movement towards a peace process, it should be taken.There is no doubt that there have been crimes against humanity.  The UN can only have credibility if we support it internationally, giving it moral and political support, but also by making contributions and granting resources.  The UN is also being tested because following the reviews of its powers and future functions, its future seems to involve a greater regional activity.  If it is to involve a regional activity, it will involve the transfer of resources.  It will also be important that the previous colonising powers get out of the way and allow countries with a record in peacekeeping and peace building to put genuine initiatives in place.I am seriously concerned about another feature that is revealed by the Darfur experience.  Issues of identity within state borders are increasingly the source of the most desperate conflicts.  Therefore I come back to the point I have suggested, namely, that no longer can we regard the sovereignty argument as an absolute that stands in the way of making human rights universal.  We are tested by that because whenever we have appeared to loosen before as regards the concept of sovereignty, we were accused sometimes of having changed ideologically on issues of colonisation and decolonisation.  The reality is that if human rights is to be universalised and become a major perspective, we must accept the need for its protection and we must be seen to be willing to have it vindicated.  This is true for the source of and impulse to rights as well.The media, in covering Darfur, must invite their readers and viewing public to move again from seeing people as just the victims of a humanitarian crisis.  They should see them rather as people with differing identities and positions on land and resources who are being deprived of their rights.  They should be seen as people who are rights carriers, whether Palestinians, Afghans or, as in this case, the different groups that comprise Darfur.  What we need to stress therefore is that the new type of rights we must enable are within as well as between countries.For all these reasons relating to the invasion, occupation, dispossession, appalling loss of life and extended rapes that have taken place as well as the cynicism in which members of the international community have viewed these matters, it is very important that we should act together.  Indeed, I very much welcome the suggestion that our motion, having been passed, should be communicated to equivalent assemblies in Europe and committees such as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am proud to be a member, to advance such views.  In this way we shall be able to say that even though we knew it was going to happen, we did not remain powerless to act, as has often happened before.  However much it takes, by whatever different means, we must act, and I believe the Government, in taking such steps as will either build peace or put an end to the massive abuse of human rights in the failure of peace, will have the support of all Members of the House.  It certainly will have the support of the Labour Party.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	436	This timely debate comes in a week when the Sudanese President, Umar Hassan al-Bashir, rejected a proposal for the United Nations to assume joint command over a peacekeeping force in Darfur and said that he would only accept UN assistance to African Union troops.  He addressed a press conference yesterday, according to Bloomberg, which was televised throughout eight cities in Sudan and surrounding countries, to the effect that he was rejecting the hybrid force.  He was quoted as saying there was no question of accepting the hybrid force because it was being rejected.  He said, "Our troops in Darfur should be part of the African Union and under the command of the African Union".If those reports coming from the coalition from Darfur are correct, it is a serious rebuff to the United Nations.  It is a timely debate, coming at a time when it seems there has been a rejection of the hybrid force.  President al-Bashir has laid down conditions that any peacekeeping force should be part of the African Union and under command of the African Union only.  This is a serious rebuff to the United Nations which has proposed, in conjunction with the African Union, the creation of a hybrid force of about 20,000 soldiers and police that would operate under joint African Union-UN leadership.In addition, the Sudanese President has described the Darfur crisis as a media creation and declared that only 9,000 people have died in the violence.  In fact, this figure is 1,000 less than he quoted at a 25 September press conference.  The United Nations has estimated that as many as 200,000 people have died in Darfur since the war erupted in February 2003, and that the region is the scene of the world's worst humanitarian crisis.  The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, said on 16 November that Sudan's Government had agreed in principle to allow the United Nations to provide $21 million in aid, advisers, equipment and logistics to help strengthen the 7,000-person African Union peacekeeping force.However, President al-Bashir has claimed that there is an international attempt to recolonise Sudan, and part of this attempt is the campaign to publish false information about genocide and mass rapes in Darfur.  The Sudanese President has also denied that his Government is rearming pro-Government militia in Darfur, describing them as bandits that his police force was pursuing.  We all know that this posturing from the Sudanese Government is unacceptable and is seriously undermining peace efforts in Darfur.We must support the African Union's Peace and Security Council's efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the human rights crisis in Darfur.  We must be alarmed at the situation there, and also in eastern Chad, given the recent increase in hostilities.  The volatility on the Sudan-Chad border and the escalation of militia attacks on civilians in both countries as well as the increasing security risk to humanitarian aid workers in the region are unacceptable.  I want to pay tribute to the brave talented people who operate under appalling conditions in that area.Despite all diplomatic efforts, the situation is clearly deteriorating.  Therefore, renewed and stronger action is urgently needed to protect civilians and end human rights abuses.  Given the recent proposal of a hybrid UN-African Union force for Darfur which was agreed in Addis Ababa on 16 November, the subsequent rejection of that proposal by the President of Sudan is most disappointing for those seeking peace.  This is based on reports from Bloomberg released last night.  Whether our lines are crossed I do not know.  I am just going on those press releases from last night and I hope they are wrong.We must condemn unreservedly the Sudanese Government's indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other war crimes, but we must push for a strengthened international protection force that has the requisite mandate and capacity to provide effective protection to civilians.  We must again call on both the Sudanese and Chadian Governments to accept such international deployment immediately.Since February 2003, at least 200,000 Darfurians have died as a result of the armed conflict.  The Government's counter insurgency operations have been characterised by war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.  Some 4 million people, more than half of Darfur's population, are now dependent on some form of international food relief.  Widespread killings, rapes and attacks by Sudanese Government forces and militia have forced 2 million people into camps.  Even these camps are not safe and the killings and rapes continue unabated.Unfortunately, civilian access to humanitarian assistance is at its lowest point since 2003-04.  With 13 aid workers killed in Darfur since May of this year and much of the region too dangerous for overland travel due to continued attacks on staff and convoys, humanitarian agencies are unable to reach hundreds of thousands of people in need across Darfur.  It is an understatement to say that the current situation in Darfur requires urgent action.  In the first week of November alone, it has been documented that the Sudanese Government has indiscriminately bombarded from the air civilians in Sudanese and Chadian villages on both sides of the border.  Water points in Darfur — essential for the survival of displaced civilians and their livestock — have also been attacked.  There is photographic evidence available of these incidents as well as countless eye witness accounts.The killing of children, including at least 26 who died in a place called Jebel Mun, and the systematic slaughter of livestock is blatant evidence that civilians and their property continue to be targeted in violation of international humanitarian law. It is questionable whether the proposal of a hybrid African Union-UN force, as outlined at the meeting in Addis-Ababa on 16 November, would have met the needs of the Darfur people or the neighbouring Chadians.  It is obvious that the Sudanese Government continues to delay and weaken any further international deployment to the region and wishes to continue with its dirty work.I support the Human Rights Watch demands that call on the Government of Sudan to cease offensive military flights, as outlined in UN Security Council Resolution 1591 and defined in the UN panel of experts report of October 2006, and to end its support, mainly funding and arms, to the Janjaweed militias and other paramilitary groups.  I also support Human Rights Watch in its demand for an immediate Sudanese Government consent to a strengthened international force in Darfur; its request that the African Union mission in Sudan, AMIS, force and any strengthened international force monitor the Government of Sudan's commitment to cease further support for ethnic militias; and its call on the Sudanese Government to accept international support and extend the mandate of the existing African Union force.Moreover, I support the application of targeted UN sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, as authorised under UN Security Council Resolution 1591 of March 29 2005, on senior Sudanese Government officials, should they continue to fail to consent to the deployment of a stronger international force in Darfur; sanctions on those individuals or groups responsible for human rights abuses or violations of the May 2006 Darfur peace agreement; and the expansion of the arms embargo provided for by UN Security Council Resolution 1591 to cover all of Sudan, not simply Darfur and the establishment of a nationwide mechanism for monitoring and enforcement.  I call on the Government of Chad to cease support for abusive Darfur rebel groups and to consent to a strengthened international force in Darfur and along the border with Chad to deter further attacks on civilians, monitor the existing UN arms embargo and help to implement the Tripoli agreement of February 2006 between Sudan and Chad.The African Union's Peace and Security Council should unanimously support a robust international protection force with the capacity to protect civilians in Darfur and along the Sudanese-Chad border.  I hope the Council members of the African Union will so do at its meeting tomorrow in the Nigerian capital of Abuja.  The African Union's slogan is "Africa Must Unite" and this is exactly what its member states must do tomorrow in Nigeria.  Darfur is a critical test for the union's Peace and Security Council and its members must unite behind the people of Darfur and eastern Chad, rather than behind governments that abuse these populations.While the appointment of Andrew Natsios as United States special envoy for Sudan and the recent tougher talk coming from Washington is welcome, it is likely that even more could be achieved by implementing and expanding the reach of some of the measures that have already been agreed by the Security Council and elsewhere.  I believe the United States, United Nations, African Union and European Union, acting together to the greatest extent possible, should now apply targeted sanctions; authorise, through the Security Council, a forensic accounting firm or a panel of experts to investigate the offshore accounts of the Sudanese National Congress Party, NCP, and NCP-affiliated businesses, to pave the way for economic sanctions against the regime's commercial entities, the main conduit for financial NCP-allied militias in Darfur; explore sanctions on aspects of Sudan's petroleum sector, which is the NCP's main source of revenue for waging war in Darfur, to include at least bans on investment and provision of technical equipment and expertise; and obtain consent of the Chad Government to deploy a rapid reaction force to that country's border with Sudan and to plan on a contingency basis for a non-consensual deployment to Darfur if political and diplomatic efforts fail to change government policies and the situation worsens.A United Nations panel of experts has recommended that sanctions be imposed on those who continue to abuse civilians and violate the arms embargo and clearly Khartoum policy makers should be top of this list.  Therefore, the European Union and its governments must apply targeted sanctions on the President and other senior Sudanese officials who are responsible for the ongoing military offensive.What can Ireland do alone?  Deputy Carey has already referred to the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, AWEPA.  Ireland can do much as a nation and AWEPA has put forward proposals regarding the impact of Irish pensions' divestment in Sudan.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who is a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, has the opportunity to set a European precedent by divesting the National Pensions Reserve Fund from companies operating in Sudan.  This has worked before because a campaign that persuaded major oil firms to divest from Sudan in the late 1990s was one of the decisive factors that forced Khartoum to negotiate an end to its civil war with south Sudan.There is a clear link between Khartoum's oil revenue and its spending on weaponry used to devastating effect in Darfur.  As Sudan is an indebted economy, a major Human Rights Watch report has shown that foreign direct investment in oil makes the all-important difference to Khartoum's military spending.  This would be a campaign of intelligent economic pressure.  It does not call for blanket divestment or for divestment from industries such as agriculture which would directly affect Sudanese civilians.  Instead, it calls for targeted divestment from industries that contribute to Khartoum's war machine.This would also be a pragmatic, strategic campaign.  In respect of the company in which Irish pensions are most heavily invested, namely, the French company Total, the campaign does not call for immediate divestment.  Instead, it calls for the Government to use the threat of divestment first and for Total, in turn, to use its leverage on the Sudanese Government to stop the killing in Darfur.Ireland has signed up its National Pensions Reserve Fund to the UN's principles for responsible investment, which constitutes a real commitment to ethical investment.  The US states of Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon and California have given this campaign momentum by divesting billions of dollars from Sudan.  In Europe, Norway is one of the Scandinavian countries that is said to be considering divesting from Sudan.Divestment is only one of a number of tactics that might apply intelligent pressure on Khartoum, first to accept a UN peacekeeping force and then to implement the Darfur peace agreement.  Further economic sanctions that would target Khartoum's interests abroad and further sanctions remain possible.

Tá sé tábhachtach anois agus arís go labhraíonn gach duine sa Teach seo le guth amháin, go háirithe ar cheisteanna a n-aontaímid leo, ceisteanna idirnáisiúnta.  Is féidir linn seo a dhéanamh amach anseo arís ar cheisteanna móra eile faoi áiteanna ina bhfuil slad agus ár á ndéanamh thar lear.Dhá bhliain ó shin, ag Ard-Fheis an pháirtí, rinne an ballraíocht trí rún a rith i dtaca le Darfur.  Ag an am sin, ghlaoigh muid ar an Rialtas anseo agus Rialtas na Breataine gníomhú go práinneach ar mhaithe le muintir an réigiúin a bhí ag fulaingt cogaíochta agus an foréigean a tháinig as.  Luíonn an rún anseo inniu leis an méid sna rúin sin ach amháin go bhfuil sé dhá bhliain níos déanaí.Is coimhlint dhearmadta í an choimhlint seo i nDarfur, le fócas na meán agus an fócas polaitiúil dírithe ar an chogadh san Iaráic agus san Afganastáin.  Cuireadh an slad i nDarfur i leataobh in a lán aigní.  Tá, áfach, ár ollmhór á dhéanamh sa tSúdáin, le breis is 30,000 duine marbh, os cionn 1 milliún brúite óna dtailte agus breis is 200,000 teifigh lonnaithe sa tír chomharsanach, an Sead.  De thairbhe ionsaithe ar oibrithe a bhí ag tabhairt cúnaimh daonna sa tír, tharraing siad siar as an tír agus, dá réir, tá curtha leis fulaingt an phobail.The report of the United Nations Secretary General to the United Nations Security Council on children and armed conflict in Sudan that covers the period from May to July 2006, details incidents of grave abuse of children's rights.  It outlines "the killing and maiming of children and, their recruitment and use as soldiers, grave sexual violence, abductions and denial of humanitarian access to children".  That recent report "indicates that these violations continue in the Sudan largely unabated".  A number of parties to the conflict in Darfur are explicitly identified as committing these abuses and these include the Sudanese armed forces, the popular defence forces, the Sudan Liberation Army, the Janjaweed militia and the Chadian opposition forces.  All members of the international community must make every appropriate effort possible to protect all vulnerable children in areas of conflict such as this and to bring an end to these grave abuses.The Darfur Peace Agreement outlaws the recruitment and use of children by rebel forces, however that agreement has had little effect because many of the rebel groups are not signed up to it.  The motion before us recognises this shortcoming and welcomes efforts to bring the non-signatories on board.  The importance of these efforts must not be underestimated.  We must also be careful not to focus on the atrocities of the Sudanese Government to the exclusion of those of the rebel forces.  There is a concern that the rebels have been emboldened by the relative lack of scrutiny to commit further and graver atrocities, and to hold out for an agreement that better favours them.While backing today's motion which condemns the appalling security, humanitarian and human rights situation, calls for all parties involved to immediately halt the violence and to ensure the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and calls on the Sudanese Government to consent to a UN mission, I also want to commend the work that has taken place thus far, particularly that of the African Union.  It is essential that this work is continued, built upon and bolstered by the UN.Ultimately while much of the focus of the motion is on security and this is crucial, particularly in the immediate term, there is also a real need for the international community to focus on assisting the political resolution of the conflict.  This is crucial if a sustainable peace is to be built.  Every appropriate effort should be made to realise the power-sharing provisions of the Darfur Peace Agreement in a meaningful way.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	438	It is worth remembering that the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan described the conditions in Darfur as little short of hell on earth.  That is probably a mild enough description of what has occurred there.  In 1994 the world stood by and watched as the Rwanda genocide claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, yet we are witnessing the same today in Darfur.  I wonder what we have learned from previous experience in Rwanda.This genocide began in 2003 when the Sudanese Government initiated brutal attacks against civilians in Darfur after rebels in the region rose up to demand a greater role in Sudan's leadership.  The goal of the killing is ethnic cleansing and the Sudanese are carrying out the genocide to wipe out the ethnically distinctive Darfurians and take over the region.  The Arab militia or Janjaweed — the riders from hell — is the primary perpetrator of most genocidal acts in Darfur and is armed and equipped by the Sudanese Government.  The Sudanese Government often attacks Darfurian communities with bombers and ground troops in co-ordination with the Janjaweed.  The Janjaweed continues to attack black Darfurians who have fled to refugee camps.  They wait for the refugees to leave the safety of the camps for desperately needed supplies like firewood.  Then they torture and kill the men and women and rape even pregnant women — there are no barriers here.More than 400,000 civilians have lost their lives in Darfur and maybe this would focus our minds on how we distribute humanitarian aid in the Third World.  No doubt getting aid to the targeted need is the big issue.  Quite often, as has been mentioned, one is dealing regularly with corrupt people and governments, and it is quite difficult.  Rather than trying to deal with every corrupt government, we should concentrate our aid on one country.  While there always will be flash points, like Darfur, the tsunami or Hurricane Katrina for which we will need a special reserve fund, we should concentrate our Third World aid.  The developed countries should adopt an underdeveloped or Third World country.  This is the way forward.  Then we can target aid and see where it goes.I gather that of €1 given in charity, 10 cents is hitting the target.  That is not good enough and the position will not improve if we try to change the entire African Continent.  We should pick or adopt one of these African countries because we are pumping in hundreds of millions of euro — a certain amount of our GDP — into Third World aid.  If we did so, we could take on education, health, infrastructure and food aid projects in that country and monitor them with full-time staff, rather than try to dot our administration across Africa, which cannot work.  I would like the Government to foster that idea amongst the developed countries.  This notion of providing a little here and there is no good.  It does not provide any way of policing the vast amount of money we will be giving and the increased amount we will be asked to give.  This would also help to reduce our administration costs.  I realise the staff must do their work out there but when one considers all the administration for which we are paying in the Third World, it is not morally right.  We should ask ourselves whether we are getting value for money.We are institutionalising children in Romania.  The type of institutional policies that we abhor in this country are coming back to haunt us here.  We are funding and recommending the building of orphanages in Romania and it is not the right way forward.  We should sit back and examine policies which we now see as wrong.  The fruits of that will only come to haunt us in 25 or 30 years time.  We should be taking a more critical look at the money that we are giving to Third World countries.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	439	It is important that we debate this issue and I am glad that the Government has put forward this motion.  My colleague, Deputy Boyle, has previously suggested that we use our pension funds in ethical ways and this may have been alluded to earlier, but certainly the suggestion that has come from our AWEPA group is worthy of consideration.  What AWEPA has suggested, and what the Green Party has previously suggested, is that we look at the pension funds in a creative and constructive way and that we should not use our pensions money to invest in harmful products such as tobacco, alcohol and armaments.  AWEPA is suggesting that we divest Irish pension funds from Sudan.  It is a suggestion which the Government Deputies ought to consider.  AWEPA states clearly that while the diplomatic deadlock persists, this is a means of applying extra pressure on Khartoum now that President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan has rejected the plan to allow the African Union UN force to be deployed in Darfur by 1 January next.  If we were to take the action AWEPA is suggesting, it would be a small step, which perhaps some would regard as insignificant but which would set the ball rolling for a much wider campaign at European Union level.  We can light that torch.  If that is done and all of the European Union countries were to act together on this, the effect would be significant.  That is why it is important that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, takes that initiative to his colleagues in the European Union as a way forward.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has a role to play in this.  He is a former Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He could set a precedent within the European Union by divesting the National Pensions Reserve Fund from companies operating in Sudan.  This has worked previously, as AWEPA has stated.  We persuaded major oil firms to divest from Sudan in the late 1990s and it was one of the decisive factors that forced Khartoum to negotiate an end to its civil war with southern Sudan.There is a clear link between Khartoum's oil revenues and its spending on weaponry which has been used with devastating effect in Darfur.  As Sudan's is an indebted economy, a major Human Rights Watch report has shown that foreign direct investment in oil makes "the all important difference to Khartoum's military spending".  This could be regarded as a campaign of intelligent economic pressure.  It does not call for a blanket divestment or for divestment from industry such as agriculture, which would directly affect Sudanese civilians.  Instead, it calls for targeted divestment from industries that contribute directly to Khartoum's war machine.  It is also a pragmatic and strategic campaign.  The campaign does not call for the immediate divestment from Total, the French company in which Irish pensions have most heavily invested; rather, it calls for the Irish Government first to use the threat of divestment and for Total, in turn, to use its leverage on the Sudanese Government to stop the killing in Darfur.Ireland had signed its National Pensions Reserve Fund up to the UN's principles of ethical investment, which is a real commitment to ethical investment.  My colleague, Deputy Boyle, has also tabled an ethical investments Bill for debate in the House.The American states of Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon and California, which have the largest pension fund in the United States, have given this campaign momentum by divesting billions of dollars from Sudan.  In Europe, Norway is one of the countries that is said to be considering divesting from Sudan.  Divestment is only one of a number of tactics that might apply intelligent pressure on Khartoum to accept a UN peacekeeping force first and then to implement the Darfur peace agreement.  Further economic sanctions targeting Khartoum's interests abroad and further military sanctions also remain as possibilities.When replying to the debate, the Minister of State should take this constructive suggestion into account.  I hope he will lead the way.
#MichaelJWoods	unknown-#MichaelJWoods-party	unknown-#MichaelJWoods-dob	unknown-#MichaelJWoods-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	440	As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I welcome this all-party motion requesting urgent action at international level to end the crisis in Darfur.  I welcome the efforts of the African Union through its 7,000 to 8,000-strong AMIS, or African Mission in Sudan force.  The decision of the UN Security Council to send a 23,000-strong peacekeeping force to Darfur is also welcome.  In this case, people cannot complain about the UN, which is anxious to send in this force in numbers.  The UN is doing everything it can to get people in on the ground.  I deplore the continuing refusal of President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan to allow the deployment of a UN force in Darfur, which the president reportedly reiterated today at a press conference in Khartoum.  I note that Sudan is to give its considered response at tomorrow's meeting of the African Union's peace and security council in Abuja.The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs had a full and intensive discussion on Darfur in October.  A delegation from the committee, comprising Deputy Michael D. Higgins, Senator Mooney and me, highlighted the need for more immediate UN efforts at conflict prevention at a recent UN meeting we attended in New York.  I condemn the brutal and inhuman treatment of the people of Darfur, as well as the fact that those in desperate need of food aid have risen from 1 million two years ago to more than 4 million this year.  I commend the work in Darfur of Irish missionaries and Irish NGOs, through which more than €16 million in official aid has been provided by the Government, bringing the total to €32 million.Ireland is doing everything it possibly can in this respect.  The House can rest assured that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will take up the proposal by Deputy Carey to contact all the foreign affairs committees in the other 24 EU member states.

Members of the House will be aware that tomorrow is a landmark day when the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, will hopefully see something through in terms of this hybrid force that has been spoken about.  I do not wish to minimise the situation or say things that may be inappropriate, but Ireland has contributed €16 million towards this effort and cannot be criticised in this regard.  We cannot praise enough the role of our NGOs, including GOAL and Concern, and many others that operate in the most difficult environment in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan.  They are doing great work, which is supported by the Government and the people.As regards the investment issue, the Government is hamstrung by legislation in that the pension agency has statutory independence.  However, it has adopted the principles of proper investment, as dictated by the UN.  I agree with Deputies Gormley, Boyle, Woods and Carey that we need to use this leverage in the future.  It is imperative that we should have control over this matter.  When other humanitarian disasters and denial of human rights occur, we cannot be left exposed on this issue.  I totally agree on those matters.

It is hugely important that we should have a coherent response.  As a country and as a people, we should not be placed in a position whereby a State investment agency is investing in companies that are facilitating genocide, as we have seen in Darfur.  I share that concept totally.As a journalist, I reported on the active Irish-American campaign on the MacBride principles.  I saw the British Government's attitude to fair employment in Northern Ireland change.  This was precisely because the financial controller of New York, which has the largest pension fund in the world, arrived in Downing Street and indicated unhappiness with the situation.  That is one of the main reasons the fair employment legislation came into being in Northern Ireland — because the financial controller of New York applied a higher ethical standard than the British Government and others with regard to fair employment in Northern Ireland.Pension fund investment has a real impact, so we should be strong enough to say that we are not prepared to stand over certain practices.  I am glad to say that our pension fund has adopted the UN principles on responsible investment.  If the Government needs to go further, it will do so.  I will speak to the pension fund representatives directly in my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights.  I intend to take this matter up directly with the agency concerned.  At the moment, I am not convinced that it is doing anything wrong because it is a signatory adhering to the principles of responsible investment.  However, if we need to go further I assure all Members of the House, including Deputies Woods, Carey and the Green Party Members, that we will do so.  The lesson to be learned from the horrible and disgraceful genocide that has occurred in Darfur is that we will go the extra mile, if necessary.I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue because I feel a strong case is to be made on amending the legislation to bring forward stronger guidelines.  The Criminal Justice Act 1999 contained a provision made by the Oireachtas on the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted of offences involving drugs with a value of €13,000 or more.  There is an urgent need to address this problem and surveys throughout Europe support this.There is a growing crisis involving young people availing freely of drugs, particularly crack cocaine, cocaine and heroin.  It is time we acknowledge that the Judiciary has not adopted the spirit of the legislation passed with the support of all sides of the House in 1999.  Some of the sentences handed down in recent years for the importation, distribution and sale of drugs indicate that a lenient position has been taken by the Judiciary in many cases on the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence.A quick perusal of relevant sentences suggests that approximately 80% fall into the category of exceptional circumstances and I find this hard to accept.  The Judiciary is accustomed to seeing drugs as an element of modern society and not a devious thing in which to be involved when it is a major problem in Irish life.  The evidence in surveys demands that this issue be addressed in a serious manner.It is time to address a small section of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 and tighten the definition of an exceptional circumstance.  The provision in the Bill will allow a member of the Judiciary, when handing down sentence, to take into account the perpetrator's co-operation with the authorities.  This might include an early plea of guilty or help with subsequent prosecutions and I accept that people in such circumstances should receive a more lenient sentence.  This is a positive thing that will encourage perpetrators to plead guilty and co-operate with the authorities in assisting in the prosecution of those higher on the drug distribution food chain.  However, I do not believe the Judiciary is acting in the spirit of the legislation.I have been criticised for speaking out on this issue but I cannot be silenced when people caught with between €80,000 and €90,000 worth of cocaine receive a sentence of seven years imprisonment with two years suspended for mitigating circumstances.  This is completely against the spirit of the legislation of 1999.  As a society, a community, parents and public representatives, we must accept that the Act passed by this House is not having the desired effect on sentencing.When one considers the affluence of Irish society and the price of drugs on the street it is obvious that people are willing to take the risk of importing, distributing and selling drugs because there are huge financial gains to be made.  If one is prosecuted, pleads guilty of engaging in such activities and assists the authorities, one receives a more lenient sentence.  This sends out a weak signal to those on the fringes, gauging the mood of the Judiciary and watching the deterrents that are in place.  It fundamentally fails our young people.I believe that the majority of people support my view and I call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Judiciary to interpret the spirit of the 1999 legislation and impose the mandatory minimum sentence on those involved in these activities.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I thank Deputy Kelleher for raising this important topic.  It is not the first time he has done so in this House.  He has been steadfast and committed on this matter on behalf of his constituents and out of a strong personal interest on a moral and political level.Mandatory sentences for drug trafficking offences were first introduced by then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  A new offence of possession of drugs with a value of, at that time, £10,000, for sale or supply was created.  The offence was inserted into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 by a new section 15A.  The offence under section 15A carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  The section provided that a court could depart from the mandatory minimum but only where there were "exceptional and specific" circumstances that would make a sentence of ten years unjust.  This is a matter that concerns Deputy Kelleher.  The new section went on to list certain factors that could be taken into account in this regard, such as a guilty plea, the stage at which a guilty plea was entered and whether the person materially co-operated with the Garda investigation.Unfortunately, the new provisions seem to have been applied sparingly, as Deputy Kelleher implies.  Figures available to the Department suggest application of the mandatory sentence reached a peak of about 20% in 2004.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is, of course, mindful of the need to respect the independence of the Judiciary and I am also conscious of this, but I am also conscious of Deputy Kelleher's comments which represent the feelings of his constituents in Cork.  The Tánaiste took the view that the intention of the Oireachtas, as set out in the 1999 amendments, was very clear and he therefore decided, in the context of the recently enacted Criminal Justice Act 2006, to strengthen the provisions to underline the intentions of the Oireachtas on the issue.The recent amendments differentiate between first and subsequent drug trafficking offences, an important point Deputy Kelleher has mentioned to me on many occasions.  In the case of first offences, the 1999 provisions continue to apply but additional factors are added which the court must take into account when deciding that the mandatory minimum sentence should not be imposed.  These factors include consideration of whether the public interest in preventing drug trafficking is served by a lesser sentence and I would suggest that in most cases the protection of the public interest would demand, as a minimum, the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence.  Where the person has a previous conviction or convictions for drug trafficking offences, it is now provided by section 84 of the 2006 Act that a sentence which is not less than the mandatory minimum sentence must be imposed.The 2006 Act created a further drug trafficking offence to which the mandatory minimum of ten years is to apply, specifically, the offence of importing drugs having a value in excess of €13,000.  This is inserted as section 15B into the 1977 Act and, for sentencing purposes, is treated in the same way as the section 15A offence.The Tánaiste's intention in the recent amendments is clear — he wishes to underline that the circumstances in which the mandatory minimum sentence may not be imposed are truly "exceptional and specific".  This is the clear intention of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, I think, Deputy Kelleher and the Oireachtas.  The Tánaiste's proposals attracted broad support in this House when the Criminal Justice Bill, as it was then, was being debated.  The Tánaiste is confident that the new provisions send a strong message and that they will be a strong deterrent for anyone planning to involve themselves in the drug trade.I thank the Deputy again for the opportunity to put this information on the record of the House.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, for attending to respond to this matter.  We all know of the great work done by charities, specifically Irish charities whose work is recognised internationally.  They must be supported and encouraged in their endeavours.  One way the Government can do this is to support the call by the Irish charities tax reform group to remove the VAT burden on charities through the introduction of a VAT compensation scheme.Charities are seeking compensation for the unreclaimable VAT they pay on expenditure.  I do not buy the argument made by the Department of Finance that charities do not pay VAT on their services because while that is the case, they pay VAT on a range of other expenses to which I will refer later.VAT compensation is a priority for several reasons, including the fact that it has been identified by charities as having a significant impact on their ability to undertake their work.  The Department or Minister must not hide behind EU directives or regulations.  The relevant EU Commissioner has stated that there is no impediment at EU level to such compensation being paid by EU member states.The Danish Government has recently acknowledged that charities have a right to such compensation and is engaged with charities in finalising the practicalities of a compensation scheme.  I ask the Department to adopt a similar approach and engage with charities here to identify ways in which it can be of assistance.  I doubt much of the money which flows back into the Exchequer every time we give a few euro to charity is allocated to priority areas such as those in which charities are involved.Charities pay VAT on fundraising efforts, promotion, essential equipment, professional fees, capital expenditure and necessary overheads in buildings and facilities.  Unlike the business sector, charities cannot reclaim VAT they pay on this expenditure.  The Minister for Finance has the power to relieve this VAT burden by compensating charities without contravening EU regulations, as was confirmed by Mr. László Kovács, the Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union, when he stated:The Commission has always considered that any scheme designed to relieve the VAT burden for charitable activities can be regarded as compatible with EU legislation if it is clearly separated from the VAT system...  I have to underline that the decision to set up such a refund mechanism is strictly a national budgetary issue over which the Commission has no say or influence.I ask the Minister for Finance to meet representatives of charities to devise a scheme to compensate for the VAT paid by charities.  The requirement on charities to pay VAT has a human cost.  For example, the €300,000 VAT bill paid annually by the Irish Cancer Society would run its entire cancer information service for a year, while the VAT bill paid by Concern last year was almost as high as its entire budget for Rwanda.  Last year, the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart paid €55,000 in VAT, a sum that would feed, clothe and educate 153 AIDS orphans for a year and achieve a tremendous amount for impoverished people in underdeveloped and developing countries.The current VAT regime as it affects charities is no more than a tax on initiative which has a major negative impact on the work of charities and the people they seek to help every day, while forming a minuscule portion of tax revenue for Government.  In bringing this matter to the Minister for Finance in the strongest possible terms I urge him to initiate discussions with the charities to provide a VAT compensation in the next Finance Bill.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	447	As the Minister of State with responsibility for Irish aid and human rights, I am impressed by the arguments the former Minister, Deputy Walsh, has marshalled on this topic.  The Minister for Finance is sympathetic to his point of view and I urge the Deputy to discuss these matters with him at the earliest possible date because he will find the Minister to be receptive.I am pleased to take this opportunity to clarify matters relating to the VAT treatment of charities.  The VAT regime and rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the sixth VAT directive charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services they purchase.  Essentially, only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.Ministerial orders have been used in the past in a limited way to provide refunds of VAT on certain aids and appliances for the disabled, medical equipment donated voluntarily to hospitals, equipment and buildings used by water rescue organisations and humanitarian goods for export.  These orders are focused and designed to target specific circumstances.  However, under EU law, it is no longer possible to introduce new schemes within the Value-Added Tax Act 1972 to relieve charities from the obligation to pay VAT on goods and services they purchase.  Further, under EU law it is not possible to remove or reduce the VAT rate for a particular customer, in this case charities, as the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service rather than the category of customer. It would not be possible, therefore, to remove or reduce the VAT paid by charities.In summary, EU law precludes removing or refunding the VAT which charities are required to pay under the taxation system.  This view is also held by the European Commission, which has stated that while charities cannot be refunded through the VAT system, there is nothing to prevent national governments paying charities a subsidy to compensate them for the irrecoverable VAT they have incurred, provided state aid rules are observed. Given that Exchequer funding is made available to very many charitable organisations, this is in effect happening.The tax code provides exemption for charities from income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, deposit interest retention tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty, probate tax and dividend withholding tax.  Charities also benefit significantly from the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations introduced in the Finance Act 2001 which, for the first time, allowed tax relief on personal donations to domestic charities and other approved bodies.  The relief is based on the taxpayer's marginal rate which for an individual donor could be as high as 42%.  In the case of donations from the PAYE sector the relief is given directly to the charities.

I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment as it concerns the care of patients with cancer in the constituency we both represent.I acknowledge the work of the Irish Nurses Organisation in highlighting the issue I raise. It is surely one of those cases which completely baffles people when they contemplate the state of our health services and the way in which the Health Service Executive and Department of Health and Children operate them.  The issue is the need to appoint an oncology liaison nurse to Cavan General Hospital.  Oncology liaison nurses provide specialised advice and counselling for patients diagnosed with cancer, as well as a valuable channel of communication between the patients and the oncology team which provides their medical treatment.In February 2004 the Irish Cancer Society funded a half-time post for an oncology liaison nurse at Cavan General Hospital and a half-time post in the Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  The local cancer steering committee agreed to fund the other half of the post for Cavan General Hospital.  Despite this funding, the position has not been filled because the Health Service Executive has failed to act to permit the appointment.It is scandalous that a post for which funding is available and which could be providing a very valuable service for cancer patients has not been filled.  The Health Service Executive has let down cancer patients in the Cavan-Monaghan catchment area served by Cavan General Hospital.  I understand that the Irish Cancer Society can no longer hold its funding for the post and if the HSE does not act it will be lost.  This would be a huge disservice to cancer patients.An oncology liaison nurse in St. Luke's Hospital describes her work as follows:My role is one of support during diagnosis of cancer and throughout subsequent treatment.  I also provide an extra channel of communication between the patient, their family and the oncologist.  This helps to ensure that both patient and family understand exactly what lies ahead.  In many cases I can help to answer questions and help to alleviate unnecessary fears.  I believe that by giving people information, time and support, there is a real benefit for the patient's psychological and emotional health, both during hospitalisation and later on at home.I commend the Irish Nurses Organisation for highlighting both the need for this post at Cavan General Hospital and the unacceptable approach of the HSE.  Cancer patients need and deserve better than this and I urge the Minister of State, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the HSE to act immediately to fill this post, otherwise, we will tragically lose the commitment to fund same.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	449	From the outset, I personally wish the Deputy and his party well in terms of the re-establishment of both an Executive and an Assembly in the North.  I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.The strategy for cancer control, launched by the Minister in June, makes recommendations on the organisation, governance, quality assurance and accreditation across the continuum of cancer care from health promotion, prevention and screening through to treatment services, supportive and palliative care and research.  There is a strong emphasis in the strategy on health promotion, addressing inequalities and quality assurance.  The Minister is committed to providing quality cancer care to the people of Ireland on an equitable basis regardless of where they live.  Deputy Ó Caoláin will take sustenance from that assertion.As the Deputy will be aware, the organisation and management of the health services is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  That is precisely why the executive was set up, to deliver services on an equitable basis across the country, free from political or other interference or pressure.The Health Service Executive has advised the Department of Health and Children that in 2005, the Irish Cancer Society offered to part fund a post for an oncology liaison nurse at Cavan General Hospital.  It was not possible to fill the post at that time.  However, the Department has been informed that the filling of the post is being actively pursued by the Health Service Executive.In fairness to the Minister for Health and Children, the Deputy has received a strong reassurance that an active process is under way to fill that vacancy.  I hope for his sake and the sake of his constituents that happens.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 152 together.In order to ensure that children whose first language is not English can succeed at school, my Department gives additional support to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of teacher posts.The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.Recent years have seen a significant rise in the number of language support posts being provided by my Department.  In the current school year there are more than 1,100 such teachers in our schools, at a cost of €67 million.  This compares with approximately 820 language support teachers last year and just 260 in the 2001/02 school year.  Hence there has been more than a four-fold increase in language support posts over the past few years.In addition to the full-time posts approved, grants towards the cost of employing part-time teachers are paid to primary schools with between 3 and 13 eligible non-national pupils.  In the 2005/06 school year, 409 schools sought grant aid under this provision.Between extra language support posts and grant aid, the level of support provided to schools to meet the needs of children whose first language is not English has increased dramatically in recent years.  Nonetheless I am very conscious of the pressures on schools — such as those in Tallaght that the Deputy has brought to my attention — that have large numbers of non-English speaking children enrolled.  I am determined to provide greater support for these schools.To that end, provision has been made in the 2007 Estimates for an extra 200 language support teachers in 2007.  A further 350 posts will be provided under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement between 2008 and 2009.  These extra posts will allow the current cap of 2 teachers per school to be reformed.While details as to the precise number of posts to be allocated at both levels in the current school year and the schools to which the posts will be allocated have yet to be finalised I can assure the Deputy that I will be anxious to ensure that the additional resources are properly targeted at those areas where they are most needed.    A comprehensive strategy is currently being finalised which will ensure that the extra investment in this area is being used to the best effect, and that it is underpinned by the right support and training for teachers.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	451	The latest figures available to my Department show that in the 2005/06 school year the vast majority of schools were offering biology while a large proportion of schools offered the other science subjects.The precise numbers are as follows:691 schools offered biology, 554 offered physics, 550 offered chemistry, 193 offered Applied Mathematics, and 69 offered the joint Physics & Chemistry course.As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has prioritised improvements in science education at all levels — from primary school science to advanced fourth level research.Progress has been made in a wide range of areas in recent years:A new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of €1,000 per school plus €10 per pupil;A revised and much more practically-focused syllabus in Junior Certificate Science was introduced in 2003 and examined for the first time in June 2006, its introduction was supported by €16 million in grants to schools;Revised syllabi in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced in the last five years and supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers; andAdditional equipment grants have been provided to schools, while laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme.The Government has also provided some €4 million for the Discover Science and Engineering Awareness Programme to ensure a co-ordinated approach to promoting interest in science.  It is engaged in a range of innovative activities to not only improve interest in science among school children and the general public, but also to encourage young people to see science as a viable career option.As the Deputy will be aware, the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry. These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.Other aspects of the Plan include:reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age;strengthening teacher training in this area;reforming maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curricula;promotion of science initiatives in Transition Year; andthe provision of information and brochures on science opportunities and careers, linking effectively with school guidance services.Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the SSTI will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	452	As the Deputy will be aware, significant improvements have been made in science education at second level in recent years.A revised and much more practically-focused syllabus in Junior Certificate Science was introduced in 2003 and examined for the first time in June 2006, its introduction was supported by €16 million in grants to schools;Revised syllabi in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced in the last five years and supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers; andAdditional equipment grants have been provided to schools, while laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme.The Government has also provided some €4 million for the Discover Science and Engineering Awareness Programme to ensure a co-ordinated approach to promoting interest in science.  It is engaged in a range of innovative activities to not only improve interest in science among school children and the general public, but also to encourage young people to see science as a viable career option.Increased emphasis on science at second level has of course been supported by the introduction of a new science curriculum for primary schools. This aims at stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age and taps into children's natural fascination with the world around them.The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry.  These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.Other aspects of the Plan include:reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum;strengthening teacher training in this area;reforming the Maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curricula; andthe provision of information and brochures on science opportunities and careers, linking effectively with school guidance services.Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the SSTI will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.As I have explained on previous occasions, I am not convinced of the value of providing laboratory assistants for schools.  As the Deputy will be aware, lab assistants have not been a universal feature of support for second level science teaching in other countries.  There is no doubt that provision of assistants in this area would lead to demands for similar assistance across other areas of the curriculum where there is a strong practical component.  So as I have said, I remain to be convinced of the necessity for them.  Nonetheless, I will keep the position under review.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I should explain for the benefit of the House that traditionally, responsibility for acquiring school sites rested with patron bodies.  In 1999 the then Minister took the decision that the Department would purchase sites for new schools where patron bodies were unable or unwilling for whatever reason to do so.However, the option remains for a Patron Body to purchase a school site if it wishes to have ownership of the property.The difficulties attaching to site acquisition, regardless of who the purchaser is, or when the site is being bought, cannot be underestimated even where sites are reserved.  The willingness of a land owner to actually sell the land is the first critical issue — cost is the other.  The House will appreciate that the Department is obliged at all times to achieve value for taxpayers' money. Nonetheless, I want to assure the House that we are moving ahead to acquire urgently needed sites.In terms of the investment being made available by this Government for site acquisition as part of the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme, I am sure the Deputy will be pleased to know that funding for school buildings has increased dramatically in recent years.  We are providing €500 million for the building programme this year, compared with just over €92 million in 1997.While investment has increased five-fold, we are naturally still concerned to make the right decisions regarding what expenditure should be prioritised for the current year.  In this context, substantial expenditure is of course required to meet the building costs of projects that have already been undertaken or are needed immediately.  Within the building programme, the highest priority is given to accommodation needed to meet extra demand in rapidly developing areas.Important changes have been made in recent years to speed up the time in which projects can be completed.  These include innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model.  In recent years, the Department has also adopted a policy of devolving much greater authority to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, which frees up Department staff to concentrate on the larger scale projects.A number of sources of information are used to plan for the correct level of school accommodation.  One of the most important sources is the local authority area development planning process.  Apart from this, a substantial amount of the time and resources are dedicated to on-going contacts with the local authorities, especially in Dublin and within the Dublin Commuter belt, to monitor housing development and to establish the timescale for the delivery of extra school accommodation.    I am anxious for local authorities to use both the powers that they have through the planning process and the resources at their disposal to assist my Department in meeting the demand for schools in their areas.For example, by zoning areas as Strategic Development Zones (SDZ), local authorities can ensure that sites are reserved for schools and also that the schools must be developed in line with the housing and other developments.  I would like to see more local authorities use the SDZ option for major developments.Another way in which local authorities can work with my Department is in the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities.  This enhanced co-operation has the effect of minimising the Department's land requirements and thus reducing site costs while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities. This model will be used in Fingal to deliver approximately 20 schools in the coming years.  The Council will acquire the sites in return for which the design of the schools will be varied to meet community needs.The range of enhanced combination facilities can include large sports halls, stage and dressing rooms, community meeting rooms, all-weather pitches and playgrounds.  These additional facilities, which will be over and above the Department's standard specifications for schools, will be available not only to the school during normal school hours but also to the local community in the evenings, at weekends and during school holidays.  Again, I would like to see this approach replicated throughout the country.These examples serve to illustrate both the extent of the work being carried out with local authorities and the importance which the Department attaches to relationships with them.  I have made my views with regard to the need for more local authorities to play a proactive role in relation to school sites known to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Members of this House can of course also assist this goal at local level by encouraging their representatives on local authorities to ensure that their Council does all they can to assist in the provision of schools in their area.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 64 together.The latest information available to my Department on the number of schools offering music relates to the 2005/06 school year.    Some 501 second-level schools offered music in junior cycle in 2005/06.  Of these, 67 are single sex boys schools, 148 are single-sex girls schools, and 286 are mixed-sex schools.  Some 449 second-level schools offered music in senior cycle in 2005/06.  Of these, 52 are single sex boys schools, 141 are single-sex girls schools, and 256 are mixed-sex schools.The Deputy will be aware that the decision as to which subjects to offer is made at the level of the individual school, subject to compliance with my Department's regulations concerning provision of the core curriculum.  Demand will of course depend on the number of students that want to take other subject options.In relation to take-up at school level, I can inform the Deputy that nearly 10,000 students sat the Junior Cert Music exam in 2006, while nearly 5,000 students sat Leaving Cert Music.The Leaving Certificate syllabus in Music was revised for first examination in 1999.  To ensure the satisfactory implementation of this syllabus, a comprehensive two-year programme of in-career development for teachers of Music was put in place.  Further courses for teachers are provided on an ongoing basis.  The assessment structure allows students to specialise in the component of the course best suited to their interests and ability.  The broad range of performance options available to students has increased accessibility to the subject and allows for students of diverse music backgrounds to participate in the subject.I see an important role for music as part of a broad curriculum that enables all students to develop to their full potential and  realise their own individual talents.  Of course, many students who do not take music as an examination subject nonetheless enjoy taking part in school musicals or singing in the school choir.  Others will enjoy music provision through schools of music operated by the VECs which are allocated teaching hours by my Department.I assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to promoting participation in music for our young people.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	455	A key focus of the Government's education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.The wide variety of measures in place for tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion reflect these concerns.  These measures range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children's literacy problems, reduced pupil-teacher ratios, increased capitation grants and measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community.  In addition, there are interventions in support of youth to facilitate access to third-level and to provide "second chance education" for young people and adults.The total provision for educational inclusion programmes in the 2007 Abridged Estimates is nearly €730 million across all levels of education.  This represents an increase of nearly €95 million on the comparable 2006 figure.  The 2007 provision includes additional funding for the implementation of measures under the DEIS action plan at pre-school, primary and second-level, additional funding for further education programmes and an increase in provision for third level student support schemes including the full year cost of the 22% increase in the top-up grant.My focus in addressing educational disadvantage is to concentrate resources on front-line services and supports for those most in need.  In this respect, the agencies working in the education sector have a key role in promoting equality of access, participation and progression.A broad range of agencies would have a role in that respect from the early education sector right through primary and second level to further and higher education and the youth sector.  These include the following:The Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education;FETAC;HETAC;The HEA; The National Centre for Guidance in Education;The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment;The National Council for Special Education;NEPS;The National Educational Welfare Board;The National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education;The NQAI; andThe Vocational Education Committees.In addition, my Department also funds a range of support services, NGOs and other organisations working in the area of educational disadvantage.  All these agencies have a vital role to play in the Government's multi-faceted strategy to tackle socio-economic disadvantage at every level of our education system.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54, 80 together.All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the NEPS or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are available on my Department's website.Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department's Website.  The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.  In the 10 months to the end of October 2006, nearly €1.2 million was spent on in region of 3,500 SCPA assessments.The NEPS service is locally based and regionally organised with a small national Head Office.  Currently, the NEPS service is now available to approximately 1,604 primary schools (representing approximately 60% of pupils) and approximately 586 post-primary schools (representing 78% of students). This number includes 46 schools in the City and County of Dublin Vocational Schemes, which have their own psychological service.In common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.The introduction of the General Allocation Model for primary schools last year, supported by the provision of over 600 extra resource teachers, means that children with high incidence special needs now longer have to wait for an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support.Since the establishment of NEPS, the number of psychologists in the service has increased from 43 to 127 at present (including 4 psychologists currently seconded to the National Behavioural Support Service).  In the last recruitment round, regional panels were used to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need.In addition to the 127 psychologists currently in NEPS, a further 6 are in the process of being recruited.  On top of this, the 17% increase in funding for the service provided in the 2007 Estimates, will allow some further expansion in the number of psychologists next year.  The actual number of extra staff will be determined shortly.To conclude, since this Government established NEPS, we have trebled the number of psychologists in the service. We have also funded in the region of 3,500 private assessments so far this year. We are committed to expanding the coverage of the service even further, are recruiting extra staff at present and plan to hire more in 2007.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	457	As the Deputy will be aware, there are now no fewer than 4,000 extra primary teachers, compared with 2002.  Furthermore, there are nearly 7,000 more primary teachers than there were in 1997.The average class size in our primary schools is now 24.  With the unprecedented increases in support staff, there is now one teacher for every 17 primary school children — down from one for 22.  Children who need extra help are getting more support than ever before.    I am sure the Deputy will be pleased to know that in the 05/06 school year, the average class size in Roscommon was just under 21 — significantly below the national average.I am sure the Deputy will also be happy to hear that the number of children in large classes nationally has been significantly reduced.  When this Government first came into office, there were more than 52,000 children in classes of 35 and over — five times the number who there were in the last school year. There were also more than 1,900 children in classes of 40 and over — compared to just over 200 in 05/06.While I appreciate the need to make further progress in reducing class size, it should be acknowledged just how much has been achieved.In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those who need help with their English.Special education provision in particular has undergone a level of expansion the extent of which nobody could have predicted a few years ago — and this was only right.  If we had put all 4,000 of the teachers hired since 2002 into classroom teaching, our average class size would be a lot smaller than it is now, but we would have done a great disservice to those children who need extra help the most.  I am sure the Deputy would accept that we have taken the right approach.Now that children with special needs are finally getting the support they deserve, we are providing extra teachers this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year, we are committed to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.We also acted this year to specifically address the needs of growing schools by making it easier to qualify for a developing school post.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned for the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.  This change specifically addressed the needs of schools which are seeing large increases in their enrolments year on year.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled but we are determined to go even further and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	458	DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The DEIS plan states that as well as provision being made for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.DEIS is designed to ensure that the schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available.  Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in DEIS, and which are receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage, can be assured that they will continue to get support to enable them to maintain services for their disadvantaged pupils.As a result of the identification and review processes, 873 schools have been invited to participate in the new Programme.  These comprise 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second level schools.Grants amounting to approximately €7.7 million due to the 670 Primary schools which are participating in the DEIS Initiative were lodged to their schools' bank accounts on 17 November 2006.  This is in addition to payments totalling €1 million which issued to those schools in June 2006.In respect of the 203 Post Primary schools participating in the initiative and 80 Post Primary Schools receiving grants under pre-existing schemes, approximately €1.5 million will have been paid by the end of the current financial year of a total allocation in the order of €4.7 million.  The balance of this allocation will be paid in the course of the 2006/2007 school year.     Also on 17 November 2006, approximately another 1,900 primary schools received some €4.1 million of grant assistance to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage.In addition to supplementary financial assistance which is provided to schools in DEIS, schools will benefit from additional measures which range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children's literacy problems, reduced pupil-teacher ratios, allocation of administrative principals on lower enrolment, measures to tackle early school leaving, measures to strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community and provision of continuing professional development for teachers.

Within NEPS, the strategy for evaluation includes a number of elements including self-review by psychologists of their work using a range of instruments.Business Planning process applies to NEPS as to all areas of the Department and at individual level the Performance Management and Development System is also embedded within the management practices of NEPS.    This Government has prioritised the development of a high quality psychological service.Since the establishment of NEPS, the number of psychologists in the service has increased from 43 to 127 at present (including 4 psychologists currently seconded to the National Behavioural Support Service).  In the last recruitment round, regional panels were used to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need.In addition to the 127 psychologists currently in NEPS, a further 6 are in the process of being recruited.

The purpose of the school survey is to assess the attitude of school authorities to the service provided by NEPS.  The principal variables to be assessed will include access to the service, partnership with service users and service delivery.  Feedback form this survey will inform and enhance future service delivery.

The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism.  My Department's ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs and in this regard my Department has established:175 Special Classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools, 6 of which are located in the Mayo area;5 special Classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome;16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum;12 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis; andApproval has also been given for the establishment of a further two such facilities.Additional training supports for staff engaged in the education provision for children with special needs including autism can be accessed through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  The service will, as appropriate, consolidate, co-ordinate, develop and deliver a range of professional development initiatives and support structures to the relevant staff.An application was recently received from the group in question to participate in the pilot scheme which has facilitated the establishment of the ABA-specific autism units nationwide.  My officials requested that the names and the psychological assessments of the children proposing to attend the centre should be forwarded to the Department in order to progress the application further.  My Department is currently awaiting this information.

All infrastructural projects in these areas, regardless of ethos, are assigned a band 1 priority status under the criteria.Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are being delivered in these areas in the fastest time-frame possible.This Government is delivering on its commitment to provide modern facilities in schools and has progressively increased funding in recent years with an aggregate total of over €2 billion alone between 2000 and 2005 and a commitment to invest a further €3b up to 2010.  This is the largest investment programme in the history of the State.The Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to both rectify decades of under investment in school infrastructure and to meet newly emerging needs in the face of a huge expansion in our population base and the rapid expansion in teacher numbers.  It has no desire to see any school in less than adequate accommodation and it will continue to tackle this issue in a structured and targeted fashion.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that earlier this month I announced a special €6.5m package for primary schools to renew PE equipment.This special PE funding package of €6.5 million was issued last week to all 3,200 primary schools.  Under the package, every school received €2,000 towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment in their school.This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, and will mean that schools can replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.  The modern equipment which can be purchased will help facilitate PE and sporting activities in schools, which everyone recognises is a very important aspect of school life.This funding package is being made as part of this Government's continued commitment to modernise facilities in schools throughout the country.  I expect to announce a PE equipment grant for post-primary schools in the coming months.In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to all primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.  The question of restoring this grant will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process in the coming years.I would, however, point out that schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula including Physical Education.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €145.58 with effect from 1st January, 2006.  From 1st January next the standard per capita grant will be increased by a further €18 per pupil bringing the overall capitation grant per pupil at primary level to €163.58.  This will represent an increase of 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.Second level schools have also benefited from substantial increases in funding for their day-to-day costs.  The standard capitation grant of €266 per pupil in 2003 now stands at €298 per pupil and the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from €127 per pupil in 2003 to €159 per pupil in 2006.From 1 January next the standard per capita grant will be increased by a further €18 to €316 per pupil.  In addition, for voluntary secondary schools the support services grant will be increased by €30 per student, which includes a further equalisation measure, to €189 per pupil.  This aggregate increase of €48 per pupil will bring the cumulative increase in the per capita and support services grants for voluntary schools since 2003 to €112 per pupil.

School building projects are prioritised in accordance with published criteria and those in rapidly developing areas are assigned the highest priority.Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible.  In recent years, my Department has also adopted a policy of devolving much greater authority to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing my Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects.    To put it in context in terms of pupil numbers, if we take new primary schools recently completed, under construction or approved to progress to construction, we are delivering over 15,000 new permanent pupil places, almost 70% of these in the Leinster area.  This figure relates to new schools only and does not include an additional 8,750 school places being delivered under the permanent accommodation scheme.This Government is determined to ensure that every child is educated in a suitable and comfortable environment.  Since 1997, great advances have been made in transforming school accommodation throughout the country, through an investment of €3 billion.  This has funded over 7,800 individual school projects in the last seven years alone.While the challenge before us in reversing decades of under-investment in school buildings and in responding to emerging needs in new population areas is great, nonetheless we are making huge progress in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second level.The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.This year alone, over €500 million is being invested in schools infrastructure and this is funding the delivery of over 1,300 building projects.  This compares with just over €90 million provided for school buildings in 1997.Under the 2006 Budget, €3.9 billion is being provided over the five years 2006-2010 for capital projects at all levels of the education sector from primary to third level.  This is proof of this Government's continuing commitment to educational infrastructure and will allow my Department to continue to take a pro-active approach in meeting school accommodation needs throughout the country.

The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each Local Authority area.The provision in respect of the Library Grant was increased substantially in 2005 — from €1.5 million in 2004 to €2.026 million in 2005, an increase of 35%. The grant was increased further to €2.07million in the current year and provision has been made for expenditure of €2.107 million in 2007.The question of increasing the provision in the future will be considered in the context of available resources and priorities within the education sector.

The guidelines will also provide teachers with information on what to assess in individual subjects of the Primary School Curriculum and how to use assessment information to plan for children's future learning in that subject.  These will be available to schools in 2007.A national report card for recording and reporting data on pupils' attainment to parents is also being developed by the NCCA.  This will be piloted in a selection of schools in the current school year and available to all schools next year.My Department is making ongoing progress in exploring potential implementation models, including dates, for the introduction of the requirement in schools.Another key consideration is how the in-service needs of teachers with regard to standardised testing can best be met.My intention is that we will proceed carefully but as quickly as possible to ensure that the recommendations proposed by the NCCA are implemented in a way that has positive benefits for children, parents, teachers and the system as a whole.

This is 1.78% of the total estimated cost of the Scheme for 2006 which is €78m.The information sought by the Deputy in relation to all categories of capital grant-aid granted to fee-charging schools under the 2006 School Building and Modernisation Programme is not readily available in my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that my Department may provide capital grant-aid to recognised schools under a variety of headings in addition to the Summer Works Scheme e.g., building grants and associated Design Team fees, emergency works, furniture and equipment, remediation programmes, etc.School building projects, whether for fee-charging schools or schools in the free education scheme, are selected for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need using published criteria.  Considerations of State support for minority religions has been an important factor in the provision of funding for such schools, given that much of the fee-paying sector has traditionally been made up of Protestant schools and those with a minority religious ethos.The amount of capital funding given to fee-paying schools has been extremely small in recent years. For example, in the period 1999-2004, the total amount of capital funding given to fee-paying schools represented just 1.6% of total second level capital expenditure.

The cost of providing the school buildings and services for these hours is included in the contract structure therefore additional costs do not accrue to the school.  The availability hours are used by the schools for tutorials, parent teacher meetings and similar school activities, however the hours may also be allocated by the schools for community use.  There is no restriction on this other than the time must be within the availability bank hours and the correct notification periods set out in the project agreement are adhered too. The allocation of the availability bank hours is entirely at the discretion of the school.It is open to any individual or group to obtain use of the school facilities directly from the Operating Company.  This would fall outside of the availability bank hours and would there for be subject to economic costs.  In addition the school authorities have the right to veto any proposed use which would be contrary to the ethos of the school.It is intended that similar provisions will be included in future projects under my Departments current PPP Programme.

The main conditions are that students must (a) be first-time undergraduates; (b) hold E.U. nationality or official refugee status; and (c) have been ordinarily resident in an E.U. Member State for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  Eligibility is determined at date of entry to the course of study.The non-EU spouse and dependent children of an EU migrant worker resident in the State may also be considered for free fees once they meet the other criteria of the scheme.The third level institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, may determine the level of fees to be charged in any cases where the Free Fees Initiative does not apply.With regard to PLC courses, the following categories of students are entitled to free access to such courses:EU nationals;persons who have refugee status in Ireland;persons in the State as the spouse of an EU national, where the EU national has moved from one country to another within the EU to work;persons (including their spouse and children) who have been granted leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds;persons who have permission to remain in the State as the parents of a child born in Ireland; andapplicants for asylum who have been granted permission to work under the terms of a government decision of 26 July 1999.Asylum seekers who do not have an entitlement to work are entitled to free access to adult literacy, English language and mother culture supports only.

It has not yet been approved by the Council or presented to me as advice by the NCCA.Until such time as I receive the advice of the NCCA, I am not in a position to indicate when I will be able to make changes to the examination of Irish.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	473	Most new schools in developing areas are provided on sites purchased by my Department.  In such cases there is no local contribution required.  In relation to refurbishments and extensions to existing school buildings the full cost is typically paid for by my Department except for a local contribution of up to €31,500 or up to €12,500 for disadvantaged or special schools.My Department's primary remit is to ensure that there are sufficient pupil places available to accommodate the demand.  However, the School Planning Section of my Department is working proactively with local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities.  This enhanced co-operation has the effect of minimising the Department's land requirements and thus reducing site costs while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities.My Department recently entered into a partnership approach with Fingal County Council to ensure that new schools can be provided to match the rapid pace of housing development in that area while at the same time providing important facilities for the community.Under the terms of the agreement and based on the school planning projections of the Department, Fingal County Council will identify and acquire appropriate sites where schools with enhanced sporting, community and arts facilities will be built to the benefit of both the school and the wider community.  It is hoped that this agreement will help to fast-track the delivery of schools and community facilities throughout Fingal.A further example is in the case of the Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) at Adamstown, Lucan where the Department is working closely with South Dublin County Council and the developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing. Under the SDZ arrangements there is a requirement that schools are in position ahead of or in line with demand, and I think that this is an approach that should be adopted by other planning authorities in relation to major new housing schemes.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	474	This Government is determined to ensure that every child is educated in a suitable and comfortable environment.  Since 1997, great advances have been made in transforming school accommodation throughout the country, through an investment of €3 billion.  This has funded over 7,800 individual school projects in the last seven years alone.This year we are spending €500 million on school buildings, compared to just over €90 million in 1997.Under the 2006 Budget €3.9 billion is being provided over the five years 2006-2010 for capital projects at all levels of the education sector from primary to third level.While the challenge before us in reversing decades of under-investment in school buildings and in responding to emerging needs in new population areas is great, nonetheless we are making huge progress.The level of work being done under the School Building Programme is at an all-time high.  While increased investment has been a central reason for this, the introduction of new schemes and changes in how projects are managed have also made a major difference.Almost 800 were approved for Summer Works projects this year.  This innovative scheme, which allows schools to get small projects done over the Summer holidays, did not exist when we came into office and schools were waiting for very many years for improvements such as rewiring, or new roofs or windows.  Now when the school gates close for the Summer, the builders move in and the students come back to an improved environment just a few short months later.To reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have also been developed for 8 and 16 classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees.Improvements have also been made in forward-planning through greater co-operation with local authorities and the publication of Area Development Plans.In relation to the school building projects awaiting progression, the Deputy will be aware that the number of projects and their individual classifications can vary according to the stage of assessment and their progression through the building programme.At present, my Department has in the region of 1,300 applications for building works on the main building programme.  These applications can range from extensions and refurbishments to applications for new schools on new sites. Their status can range from applications recently received in the Department to projects at various stages of architectural planning.These projects are assessed and prioritised in accordance with the prioritisation criteria agreed with the Education Partners.  In this regard, it should be noted that a project's banding, or classification, can be subject to reassessment having regard to demographic developments in the area served by the school and also, for example, if on foot of a technical examination of the school it was found that the proposed project put forward by the school was not an appropriate design solution to meet the accommodation requirements.In addition to the projects above, there are also approximately 400 applications under the Small Schools Initiative and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme — many of these may also have applied under the main programme.  These applications are currently being assessed with a view to an announcement being made shortly.  In addition,  1,300 applications for the Summer Works Scheme 2007 are also currently being evaluated.The €3.9 billion envelope provided for education capital in the 2006 budget means that huge progress will continue to be made on school buildings in the coming years.  This year alone over 1,300 building projects will be delivered.

The 2007 Estimate provides nearly €3.2 billion for primary education — this represents a 70% increase since 2002.  The corresponding increases between 2002 and 2007 for the second and third level sectors are 54% and 40% respectively.The Deputy will be aware that staffing levels in our primary schools have improved dramatically in recent years, with 4,000 extra primary teachers put in place since 2002.  Particular attention has also been paid to improving funding to primary schools to meet their day-to-day running costs.Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level was increased from €57.14 per pupil to €145.58 with effect from 1st January, 2006.  From 1st January next the standard per capita grant will be increased by a further €18 per pupil bringing the overall capitation grant per pupil at primary level to €163.58.  This  represents an increase of 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.  In addition, the already enhanced rates of capitation grant payable in respect of pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes in ordinary primary schools are being significantly increased. Depending on the particular category of special need involved, increases in this area range from 30% to 53% with an increase of 96% applying to the physical disability category.  The latest increases in the level of capitation grant are a clear demonstration of my commitment to improve the financial position of schools in the primary sector.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	480	In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, the approved course for Junior Certificate students in second level schools must include Irish, English, Mathematics, Social Personal and Health Education, Civic Social and Political Education and at least 3 other examination subjects.    While Science is an optional subject for the Junior Certificate some 86% of students already study the subject.  I have no plans to make science a compulsory subject.  Curricular choice is important in ensuring that young people are offered a balanced range of subjects in keeping with their interests and abilities.My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects.The revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus which was examined for the first time in 2006 aims to make the subject more relevant to student's needs in the twenty-first century and to provide the students with a richer educational experience.It is intended as part of the recently published Strategy for Science and Innovation 2006 to 2013 to build on this in the approach to science subjects in the senior cycle, ensuring a continuum in the emphasis on project based hands-on investigative approaches and assessment of these as part of the overall examinations, allied with the embedding of key skills, a more applied focus and an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society forms part of the approach.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 130 together.In relation to forward planning in areas of rapid growth, the process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.  Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process, as the school authorities would usually alert the Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.  In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.Over and above the statutory consultation provisions in relation to local authority draft area development plans, the Department has in recent years worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision. On top of this, the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects, which were revised following consultation with the Education Partners, targets school projects in rapidly developing areas by assigning them a band 1 rating which is the highest priority possible.  Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest timeframe possible.  This is clear evidence of the Department's commitment to ensuring that the needs of rapidly developing areas are met as quickly as possible.School Planning Section is also working proactively with some local authorities on the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities.In addition the Department has introduced a new school planning model involving published area development plans.  One of the areas assessed is the N4/M4 corridor which includes Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock.  The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process.  In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.  Arising from this process, an individual plan will set out the blueprint for the future of educational provision in an area, which will be the touchstone against which all decisions in relation to capital investment will be made for the next decade.In all developing areas in Kildare, the Department continually monitors the demand for primary and post-primary education and takes a decision to purchase reserved sites and construct new schools as the need is determined.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 122 together.Earlier this year I announced an implementation strategy following publication of "School Matters" the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, and that strategy is now well advanced.At the core of the recommendations of the Task Force was the putting in place of a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS).  This has now happened with the appointment of a National Co-ordinator and four Assistant National Co-ordinators.  In addition, nine Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates have been recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative.  A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a senior psychologist and three psychologists.  These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way.  A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues:1. The development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement.2. The development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and impact on classroom and whole school behaviour.3. On-going training for the NBSS team.4. Research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.The NBSS has commenced its engagement with schools and a series of information seminars have been organised throughout the country.  Subsequently intensive work will begin with a smaller number of schools most in need of this intervention.It is my intention that this new service will work intensively with those schools initially selected for inclusion in this development.  I have already announced that part of this work will see us trialling the concept of a behaviour support classroom in up to 30 schools next year.  I want to emphasise however that these classrooms cannot be, in themselves, a solution to the issue of poor student behaviour.  They must be one part of a holistic response which should see a school, actively supported by the Behaviour Support Team, defining for itself a pathway to improvement.In relation to the Task Force recommendations in respect of class size, I wish to draw the attention of the Deputies to the significant improvements that have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years.  The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.21:1 in the 2005/06 school year.  The reduction in the ratio was achieved through the creation of 2,017 additional posts and the retention of over 2,100 posts which would otherwise have been lost due to the fall in enrolments.  I should add that I have consistently ruled out the creation of additional teaching posts across the second level system as a response to the issue of poor student behaviour.  On the contrary I see this issue as requiring focused intervention along the lines now being pursued.It terms of expenditure, funding has been provided to cover the costs of the NBSS recruitment process, staff training and development, staff salaries, establishment of an NBSS Office, development of an NBSS website and the information seminars with schools.  At this stage, it is anticipated that the €2 million allocated in 2006 toward the implementation of the Task Force's recommendations will be fully expended by the end of the current financial year.I wish to draw the attention of the Deputies to my announcement in the context of the 2007 Estimates, that I am providing €8million to support the work of the NBSS, in helping schools promote positive student behaviour at second level.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 91, 109, 115 and 140 together.Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools.  The reference date for the provision by schools of this information is the 30th September of the school year in question and the date for return by the schools is 31 October.  Consequently, the details for the current school year (2006/2007) are not yet available.The most recent figures available in my Department are for the 2005/2006 school year in which there were 62,691 children in primary classes of 0-19, 105,797 children in classes of 20 to 24, 162,365 children in classes of 25 to 29, 101,223 children in classes of 30 to 34, and 9,684 children in primary classes of 35 to 39.In terms of measuring progress, I am sure the Deputies will be interested to know that in the school year in which this Government came into office there were 52,190 children in classes of 35 and over — five times the number that there are now.  Some 1,901 of these children were in classes of 40 and over — compared to just over 200 last year.As the Deputies will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.As the Deputies know, all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled but we are determined to go even further and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputies that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.

This compares to primary schools operating book rental schemes which have been paid €28.40 in respect of each eligible pupil in the infant classes and €38.10 for each eligible pupil in the 1st to 6th classes.  Primary schools designated as disadvantaged and operating book rental schemes have been paid €32.00 in respect of each eligible pupil in the infant classes and €44.30 for each eligible pupil in the 1st to 6th classes.A total of €5,350,000 — an increase of €1,350,000 (33.75%) on the allocation for the 2005/06 school year — was allocated in respect of the school books scheme in the 2006/2007 school year.   Of this amount €4,775,253 was paid to primary schools operating loan/rental schemes. The allocation for 2006/2007 included an amount of €0.5m which was made available under the School Books Grant Scheme to primary schools in the School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS.Schools participating in the SSP that indicated that they would operate a book/loan rental scheme in 2006/2007 received grant aid at a higher rate per eligible pupil than applied in the case of schools generally.  The extra funding is aimed at supporting the establishment, development and ongoing operation of book loan/rental schemes.At second level, in addition to the provision of grants towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils, my Department also provides seed capital funding to certain schools in order to assist in the establishment of book loan/rental schemes.  These would be schools designated as disadvantaged or which participate in schemes aimed at combating educational disadvantage.Expenditure on the School Books Grant Scheme in second level schools in 2005 was €7.018m.  Of this amount some €0.3m was provided in seed capital for book loan/rental schemes.  The 2006 allocation is €7,518,000, an increase of €500,000 over 2005.The additional €500,000 in 2006 is for second level schools participating in the SSP under DEIS, which have indicated that they will operate a book loan/rental scheme in 2006/07.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I welcome the Pobal report which was published last month. This report makes a number recommendations for overall government policy, the work of individual government departments, including the Department of Education and Science, state agencies and higher and further education institutions.The achievement of a more inclusive and intercultural approach across a range of state services, including further and higher education provision, is an essential part of our development as a modern society and economy.  Many of the barriers identified in this report are being addressed through the National Action Plan Against Racism 2005-2008.  A departmental steering committee has been established to co-ordinate the Department's response to the education of newcomers.  I will arrange for the Pobal report to be brought to the attention of the steering committee and for the findings of it to be considered as part of its work.The Pobal report is also helpful with the work of the HEA, National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education which, in collaboration with the National Consultative Committee on Inter-Culturalism and Racism (NCCRI), hopes to make significant progress in 2007 on the advancement of intercultural strategies for access to higher education in Ireland.  This will include collaboration with key stakeholders, including Pobal and representatives of higher education institutions, on the development of current policy and practice.  This work will be presented and discussed at a conference to be held later in 2007.A recurrent theme in the Pobal report is the need for better data.  I understand that preliminary findings from this year's census will be available by the middle of next year and that these will also be considered at the conference in 2007.  The information emerging from the 2006 census will, for the first time, allow for the co-relation of data on nationality, ethnic background, age, social class, location and level of educational attainment.  This analysis, as well as the tracking of admission and participation of under-represented groups at all levels of the education system, will be key to advising the focus of future policy and funding.Another recommendation of the report is the need for clear information on entitlements to financial support for potential and actual students from ethnic minorities.  Following the 2005 review of access funding, the National Office are in the final stages of developing a co-ordinated information strategy which will assist students and their families in navigating existing financial supports available to them in further and higher education.  This work includes the development of a new website and accompanying financial information that is being developed for new entrants to further and higher education.

These included projects to progress through various stages of architectural design, tender and construction and projects approved under the devolved schemes.  A further 400 projects were approved for funding this year under my Department's emergency works programme.Over 1,300 building projects will be carried out under my Department's Capital Programme this year alone.  This is in addition to over 6,500 projects delivered following on a record investment of over €2 billion in educational infrastructure in the period 2000 to 2005.I am confident that the allocation from Government of €3.9 billion in capital funding for the education sector over the next 5 years will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach in modernising school accommodation throughout the country.To put it in the context of pupil numbers, if we take new primary schools recently completed, under construction or just now going to construction, we are delivering over 15,000 new pupil places.  This figure relates to new schools only and does not include an additional 8,750 school places being delivered under the permanent accommodation scheme.  The next tranche of projects currently in the pipeline and due to go to construction during 2007 will deliver a further 9,500 pupil places in new school buildings and a further 5,500 pupil places in existing schools.  In addition, the programme of modernisation in existing schools continues apace and will eventually encompass all schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 144 and 151 together.Physical Education is one of seven curriculum areas within the revised Primary School Curriculum (1999).  A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils.In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum.  The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable.  The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.Physical education is an integral part of the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) programme.  All LCA students must take two modules — Leisure Studies and Health Related Fitness — and there are four additional modules from which they can make further choices.The Physical Education curricula at both primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary. Consequently, they offer a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it.Apart from the formal curricula, schools can take a range of measures to encourage physical activity among students during the school day and many provide extensive, broad-based programmes of co-curricular physical activities that are highly rewarding for both pupils and teachers alike.  In particular, schools play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community.  Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for such participation.I have no plans to introduce a specific grant for swimming classes.  Where schools decide to provide pupils with swimming classes in school time, they are expected to fund them from resources already available to them.  In this regard, I recently announced that the capitation grant for primary and second level schools will be increased by €18 per pupil next year.  My Department will also be issuing a special PE equipment grant of €2,000 per school in the coming weeks, as a once-off measure, to all 3,200 primary schools to enable them improve their PE facilities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	490	This Government is determined to ensure that every child is educated in a suitable and comfortable environment.  Since 1997, great advances have been made in transforming school accommodation throughout the country, throughan investment of €3 billion.  This has funded over 7,800 individual school projects in the last seven years alone.This year we are spending €500 million on school buildings, compared to just over €90 million in 1997.  Under the 2006 Budget €3.9 billion is being provided over the five years 2006-2010 for capital projects at all levels of the education sector from primary to third level.While the challenge before us in reversing decades of under-investment in school buildings and in responding to emerging needs in new population areas is great, nonetheless we are making huge progress.The level of work being done under the School Building Programme is at an all-time high.  While increased investment has been a central reason for this, the introduction of new schemes and changes in how projects are managed have also made a major difference.Almost 800 were approved for Summer Works projects this year.  This innovative scheme, which allows schools to get small projects done over the Summer holidays, did not exist when we came into office and schools were waiting for very many years for improvements such as rewiring, or new roofs or windows.  Now when the school gates close for the Summer, the builders move in and the students come back to an improved environment just a few short months later.To reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have also been developed for 8 and 16 classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees.Improvements have also been made in forward-planning through greater co-operation with local authorities and the publication of Area Development Plans.In relation to the school building projects awaiting progression, the Deputy will be aware that the number of projects and their individual classifications can vary according to the stage of assessment and their progression through the building programme.At present, my Department has in the region of 1,300 applications for building works on the main building programme.  These applications can range from extensions and refurbishments to applications for new schools on new sites. Their status can range from applications recently received in the Department to projects at various stages of architectural planning.    These projects are assessed and prioritised in accordance with the prioritisation criteria agreed with the Education Partners.  In this regard, it should be noted that a project's banding, or classification, can be subject to reassessment having regard to demographic developments in the area served by the school and also, for example, if on foot of a technical examination of the school it was found that the proposed project put forward by the school was not an appropriate design solution to meet the accommodation requirements.     In addition to the projects above, there are also approximately 400 applications under the Small Schools Initiative and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme — many of these may also have applied under the main programme.  These applications are currently being assessed with a view to an announcement being made shortly.  In addition, 1,300 applications for the Summer Works Scheme 2007 are also currently being evaluated.The €3.9 billion envelope provided for education capital in the 2006 budget means that huge progress will continue to be made on school buildings in the coming years.  This year alone over 1,300 building projects will be delivered.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 444 and 461 together.The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.I wish to advise the Deputy that the scheme itself has not changed.  However, on review of a number of applications for home tuition, details concerning the qualifications of some of the proposed tuition providers gave rise to concern. As home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, the Deputy will appreciate the need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned.  The usual requirement is a fully qualified teacher.  However, other qualifications are acceptable depending on the individual needs of the child.  In this context a review of qualifications is underway in consultation with my Department's inspectorate.Nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than teaching qualifications have been accepted for the first school term this year to allow time to establish the suitability of the range of qualifications submitted.  I understand that officials in my Department expect to be in contact with all parents concerned next week who will be informed of the decision which will result in approval for subsequent terms of the nominated tuition provider or direction to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications.  It is important to stress that the allocation of tuition hours under the scheme is not at issue in the context of the review of qualifications in this regard.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	493	Student practical work has been a major feature of science syllabi at both junior and senior cycle levels for many years and science teachers have long experience of conducting practical work with their students. Until 2006, practical work was assessed only through the medium of written papers in the Certificate examinations.The revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus which was examined for the first time in 2006 aims to make the subject more relevant to students' needs in the twenty-first century and to provide the students with a richer educational experience.  In this regard, a second assessment component was introduced to allow students to obtain recognition for the practical work they have carried out in the laboratory.  In all, 35% of the marks in the final examination are available for this work.The introduction of the revised Junior Certificate science syllabus has been supported by a comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers. This has focused on supporting teachers in providing students with an appropriate experience of practical work.  In this context, due regard was given to health and safety issues where appropriate.  In addition, the Department has provided substantial equipment grants to schools.  All schools in the Free Education Scheme were provided with a grant of €3,500 for each junior science laboratory and those which had not had a major capital upgrading since 1995 were invited to apply for an enhanced grant on the basis of their identified needs.  In total, some €16 million was made available to schools in 2004 for the purchase of equipment and the refurbishment of school laboratories to facilitate the introduction of the revised syllabus.The Inspectorate of my Department is currently implementing a comprehensive programme of evaluation in schools.  This programme is designed to identify and affirm good practice while constructively identifying areas for improvement in the implementation of the curriculum.  In the case of the sciences, the provision of appropriate practical activities for students is one aspect of the evaluation process.  The Inspectorate will publish a composite report on the teaching and learning of Science in the junior cycle early in 2007.My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects.  Progress in these areas is a vitally important part of our national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.

We have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996/97.  Indeed, the number of PLC places approved for 2005/2006 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004/05 level.  The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188.  We also extended the provision of maintenance grants to PLC students with effect from September 1998.  There were nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they received some €23 million in direct support. Tuition fees for PLC courses are also waived.  PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs.  A supplementary non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable.  This amounted to €5.5 million in 2005.Other developments funded by my Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the Institutes of Technology.The McIver Report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations.  It has been estimated, in consultation with management and staff interests, that the recommendations for staffing would involve at a minimum the creation of at least 800 new posts at a cost of over €48 million.The recently published ‘‘Towards 2016: Ten Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015'' has noted that, having regard to developments in the PLC sector, including the McIver report, concrete prioritised proposals in relation to PLC provision, and focused in particular on the larger PLC providers will be prepared and will be the subject of further negotiations between management and unions.The level of resources for the PLC sector will be determined in the light of resources generally and the implications for other areas of education.  The scope for rationalisation of provision, will also be examined having due regard to ensuring appropriate provision, on a geographic basis and the necessary critical mass for delivery of a quality education service.  I want to invest in educational opportunity for learners in Further Education by providing the necessary system supports that will allow the sector as a whole to fulfil its important potential.

This comprised 228 WSEs at primary level and 57 WSEs at post-primary level.  A further 22 evaluations were conducted in other centres for education including Youth Encounter Project schools, Youthreach Centres and Senior Traveller Training Centres.By the end of 2006 the evaluation phase of WSE will have been completed in all of the above.  160 of the WSE reports will have been issued to the schools or centres by the end of December 2006.  The remainder will issue to schools or centres and be published on the Department's website in early 2007 in accordance with the agreed timeframe for the publication of reports.

The Primary Education Committee was established in October, 2003 in order to examine a range of issues in relation to males entering primary teaching, and to make recommendations on short-term and long-term strategies to increase the numbers in this regard.During the course of its work, the Committee drew on the professional insight of key experts in the area as well as drawing on a number of relevant research studies.  As part of this process, the Committee commissioned the research on male and female teachers' attitudes to primary teaching to which the deputy refers.  In developing its recommendations, this research was given full consideration by the Committee.In November, 2005 I launched the final report of the Primary Education Committee, "Males into Primary Teaching".  One of the key recommendations in the Committee's report is that a promotion campaign, which would encourage more males to enter primary teaching, should be undertaken.  This campaign commenced in January, 2006 and is ongoing.  All other recommendations contained in the report have also received consideration within my Department, and the level of males entering primary teaching will continue to be closely monitored.

There are a total of ninety Youthreach Centres managed by the VEC sector throughout the country.  Overall, there are about 6,500 places available nationally at present, 3,250 of which are in the VEC sector and the remainder in Community Training Centres under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Basic skills training, practical work training and general education are features of the programme, and the application of new technology is integrated into all aspects of programme content.  The programme provides a strong emphasis on personal development, on the core skills of literacy/ numeracy, communications and IT, along with a choice of vocational options such as Catering, Hairdressing, Computers, Woodwork, Photography, Video, Sports, Art and Craft and a work experience programme. Expenditure on the programme in 2005 was nearly €47 million.  In addition my Department provides funding to VEC's annually to assist towards the childcare expenses of participants in Youthreach.The Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015 — Towards 2016 provides a commitment to increase places on the Youthreach programme by 1,000 places by the end of 2009.  I was delighted to be able to announce in the Estimates for 2007, that funding is being made available to begin working towards that target.  400 places out of the total 1,000 will be made available in 2007.

My Department's planning guidelines for new schools include, where appropriate for PE Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts.Such provision is typically included in the accommodation brief for large-scale school building projects.  Between 2000 and 2005 a total of 355 large-scale projects were delivered in primary schools by my Department as part of an overall investment of €2 billion in modernising primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  In addition, my Department has also sanctioned a further 119 such projects in primary schools for progression to tender and construction.This year alone €506m is being invested in schools infrastructure and this is funding the delivery of over 1,300 building projects. Building on the record investment in recent years the Government is providing €3.9 billion in capital funding for the education sector over the next 5 years.  This is proof of its continuing commitment to educational infrastructure and will allow my Department to adopt a multi-annual framework to the provision of modern facilities in school buildings including general purpose and sports facilities.

The purpose of this Team was envisaged as helping identify problems of student behaviour in second-level schools, leading to the development of strategies to resolve these problems and to facilitate the implementation of these strategies in practice.When launching the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour, I indicated my agreement to the establishment of this Behaviour Support Team which I regarded as a priority for my Department.  Since then, and over a short time-scale, a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) has been established which is based in Navan Education Centre.  A multi-disciplinary professional team has been recruited and appointed to the NBSS which consists of a National Co-ordinator, four Assistant National Co-ordinators, eight Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates.  In addition, a senior psychologist and three psychologists have been assigned to the team.  A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues:1. The development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement.2. The development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and impact on classroom and whole school behaviour.3. On-going training for the NBSS team.4. Research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.The NBSS has just commenced its engagement with schools and a series of information seminars have been organised throughout the country.

On foot of various representations which I received regarding management at University College Cork, I asked the Higher Education Authority for a report on the issues raised. The Chief Executive and representatives of the HEA met the Chair and representatives of the Governing Body of UCC on 24th October 2006, to discuss the issues and how they may be addressed.Following these consultations the HEA announced that a person who is external to, and independent of UCC, is to be appointed by the Governing Body of UCC to review allegations not already inquired into by the Governing Body. This person is appointed by the Governing Body on foot of its powers and not under the sections of the Universities Act 1997 dealing with the appointment of a Visitor. The Governing Body of UCC, in agreement with the HEA have, on 13th November 2006, appointed Mr. John Malone as the independent person. Mr. Malone was, until 2004, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture and Food.In the case of allegations which have been, or are being, inquired into by the Governing Body, the independent person will review the Governing Body's process. The independent person will report to the Governing Body, stating if there is substance in any allegations and he can make recommendations for remedial action and/or a further process of examination if considered appropriate. An interim report is expected by 12 December 2006. The Governing Body will then report to the HEA who will advise me of any action they consider appropriate.

Over €440m has been expended to date, this amounts to 87% of the allocation.  I anticipate that the budget will be fully spent by year end as was the case in 2005.  As a result of a record investment in school infrastructure of over €2 billion from 2000 to 2005 over 6500 projects have been delivered in this period.  A further 1300 projects will be delivered in 2006.The infrastructural investment needs in schools will continue into the future.  However, I am confident that the allocation from Government of €3.9 billion in capital funding for the education sector over the next 5 years will enable my Department to continue to take a pro-active approach in modernising school accommodation throughout the country.

The social aspect of breakfast clubs cannot be overestimated and access to such clubs are offered on a whole class/whole school basis to encourage integration of children and young people giving them an opportunity to mix and relax before classes commence.Breakfast clubs provide a caring and supportive environment where young people can engage with their peers and discuss things in a social setting.  They also provide an opportunity to help them with homework, providing pencils, copybooks and other  materials to avoid possible disruption later in the classroom.  Parents are also encouraged to become involved in running breakfast clubs, many of which are also supported by charitable agencies which bring with them expertise such as family support.The School Meals Programme aims to supplement the nutritional intake of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to allow them to fulfil their potential within the educational system and also to reduce the risk of early school leaving.  In 2006, it is estimated that 69,903 children benefited in 1,008 schools under the local projects scheme and the urban scheme provided support for more than 386 primary schools, with 55,000 pupils.  In 2006, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has provided funding of about €10.4 million for the programme — an increase of nearly 27% on the 2005 provision of €8.2 million.My Department has been working in close co-operation with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure that the resources available for school meals are used to best effect and to further expand school meals provision in schools serving disadvantaged communities.  Each of the 873 schools participating in the new School Support Programme, under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, will have access to the School Meals Programme.In addition, it is proposed that under the Dormant Accounts Fund a once-off start-up grant will be provided to schools commencing participation in the School Meals Scheme to provide suitable facilities and purchase equipment.  The provision of breakfast clubs will continue to be a priority for the Government in tackling educational disadvantage.

It provided for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board, a core function of which is to ensure that each child ‘‘attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education". Under section 14 of the Education (Welfare) Act, the NEWB is required to maintain a register of children receiving education in places other than a recognised school and this would extend to situations where parents are educating their children at home.A Working Group of the Inspectorate of my Department has drawn up Guidelines for the Assessment of Education in Places Other Than Recognised Schools.  A key aspect of the Education (Welfare) Act is that children receiving education in places other than recognised schools must be registered with the National Educational Welfare Board.  Parents who choose to have their child educated in a place other than a recognised school must register with the Board, and the Board in turn must be satisfied that the child is receiving ‘‘a certain minimum education.''A certain minimum education should:be suited to the age, ability, aptitude and personality of the child;be responsive to the child's individual needs, should take cognisance of the areas of learning that are of interest to the child, and should ensure that his/her personal potential is enhanced and not suppressed;address the immediate and prospective needs of the child, in the context of the cultural, economic and social environment;provide a reasonably balanced range of learning experiences, so that no one aspect of the child's learning is emphasised to the exclusion of others;develop the personal and social skills of the child and prepare him/her for the responsibilities of citizenship;contribute to the moral development of the child;ensure the development of basic skills (as outlined below) so as to prepare the child to participate in society and everyday life; andprovide opportunities for the child to develop his/her intellectual capacities and understanding.A parent must apply to the NEWB to have his or her child registered and the application must be made in writing and set out the place where the child is receiving the education and must comply with requirements that may be set out in any Regulations made by the Minister for Education and Science or that may be developed by the NEWB with the Minister's approval at any time.The act provides that, initially, the National Educational Welfare Board will carry out, in consultation with the parent who made the application, an assessment of:(a) the education that is being provided, or that it is proposed will be provided, to the child;(b) the materials used, or that it is proposed will be used, in the provision of such education; and(c) the time spent, or that is proposed will be spent, in the provision of such education.The purpose of this assessment is to determine whether the child is receiving, or will receive, a certain minimum education.Our Constitution recognises the family as the primary educator of the child and defines duties and responsibilities for parents and the State in the education of children.  Drawing on these provisions, on legislation, and on case law, the Guidelines for the Assessment of Education in Places Other Than Recognised Schools provide a working definition of ‘‘a certain minimum education'' and guidance on how this may be assessed, given best educational practice and the nature of educational provision in the home and other settings.

Since 1997, great advances have been made in transforming school accommodation throughout the country, through an investment of €3 billion.  This has funded over 7,800 individual school projects in the last seven years alone.  This year we are spending €500 million on school buildings, compared to just over €90 million in 1997.  Under the 2006 Budget €3.9 billion is being provided over the five years 2006-2010 for capital projects at all levels of the education sector from primary to third level.While the challenge before us in reversing decades of under-investment in school buildings and in responding to emerging needs in new population areas is great, nonetheless we are making huge progress.  The level of work being done under the School Building Programme is at an all-time high.  While increased investment has been a central reason for this, the introduction of new schemes and changes in how projects are managed have also made a major difference.Almost 800 were approved for Summer Works projects this year.  This innovative scheme, which allows schools to get small projects done over the Summer holidays, did not exist when we came into office and schools were waiting for very many years for improvements such as rewiring, or new roofs or windows.  Now when the school gates close for the Summer, the builders move in and the students come back to an improved environment just a few short months later.To reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have also been developed for 8 and 16 classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees. Improvements have also been made in forward-planning through greater cooperation with local authorities and the publication of Area Development Plans.In relation to the school building projects awaiting progression, the Deputy will be aware that the number of projects and their individual classifications can vary according to the stage of assessment and their progression though the building programme. At present, my Department has in the region of 1,300 applications for building works on the main building programme.  These applications can range from extensions and refurbishments to applications for new schools on new sites.  Their status can range from applications recently received in the Department to projects at various stages of architectural planning.These projects are assessed and prioritised in accordance with the prioritisation criteria agreed with the Education Partners.  In this regard, it should be noted that a project's banding, or classification, can be subject to reassessment having regard to demographic developments in the area served by the school and also, for example, if on foot of a technical examination of the school it was found that the proposed project put forward by the school was not an appropriate design solution to meet the accommodation requirements.In addition to the projects above, there are also approximately 400 applications under the Small Schools Initiative and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme — many of these may also have applied under the main programme.  These applications are currently being assessed with a view to an announcement being made shortly.  In addition, 1,300 applications for the Summer Works Scheme 2007 are also currently being evaluated.  The €3.9 billion envelope provided for education capital in the 2006 budget means that huge progress will continue to be made on school buildings in the coming years.  This year alone over 1,300 building projects will be delivered.

I expect that NSAC will report on all the applications made to it in the normal time-frame and will make recommendations to me for consideration in the new year.The Department has received proposals from County Dublin Vocational Education Committee in relation to the patronage of primary schools that will be co-located on a shared campus basis with planned post-primary schools that will be under the patronage of the VEC in rapidly developing areas.  These proposals are currently being considered by the Department.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 159 and 160 together.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department's Estimates for 2007 include a provision of €9.8 million for the National Educational Welfare Board.  This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level.This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk.  Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.  The increase in funding for the Board will allow it to expand its services further and increase to staffing.Since we formally launched the Board in December 2003, the number of staff has increased to 94.  The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide.  Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme.  In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.  Educational Welfare Officers monitor school attendance and work to improve it.  They also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.Since January 2004, 20,000 cases involving students with reported school attendance difficulties have been resolved by the Board. The NEWB has also written to every family with children of school going age advising them of their rights and responsibilities in relation to education and school attendance and where they can get help.The first national data on school attendance has also been collected and is being used to inform the Board's work.  In relation to the effectiveness of the service, it is encouraging to note research findings that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved in 2004/05 compared with the previous year.The Board is currently working on guidelines for schools on developing attendance strategies and the prevention of student absenteeism.  Work is also advanced on guidelines for codes of behaviour.  So, while the NEWB was set up just three years ago, a lot has already been achieved by the service and the Government is committed to strengthening its role even further.It should, however, be remembered that the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school.  In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and services such as breakfast clubs and homework clubs.In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently some 490 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school.  School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies.  Access to these services is being increased under the new Action Plan for tackling educational disadvantage, DEIS.My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources and significant scope exists for integrated working between these personnel and Educational Welfare Officers.  Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed including NEWB resources.  It is anticipated that the outcome of this work will continue to inform my Department on the staffing requirement for the NEWB into the future.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	512	As the Deputy will be aware, there are now no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  Furthermore, there are nearly 7,000 more primary teachers than there were in 1997. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those that need help with their English.  Special education provision in particular has undergone a level of expansion the extent of which nobody could have predicted a few years ago, and this was only right.  If we had put all 4,000 of the teachers hired since 2002 into classroom teaching, our average class size would be a lot smaller than it is now, but we would have done a great disservice to those children who need extra help the most.  I am sure the Deputy would accept that we have taken the right approach.Now that children with special needs are finally getting the support they deserve, we are providing extra teachers this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.  This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year, we are committed to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.We also acted this year to specifically address the needs of growing schools by making it easier to qualify for a developing school post.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned for the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.  This change specifically addressed the needs of schools which are seeing large increases in their enrolments year on year.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled but we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	513	In relation to forward planning in areas of rapid growth, the process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.  Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process, as the school authorities would usually alert the Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.  In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.Over and above the statutory consultation provisions in relation to local authority draft area development plans, the Department has in recent years worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision.On top of this, the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects, which were revised following consultation with the Education Partners, targets school projects in rapidly developing areas by assigning them a band 1 rating which is the highest priority possible.  Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest timeframe possible.  This is clear evidence of the Department's commitment to ensuring that the needs of rapidly developing areas are met as quickly as possible.School Planning Section is also working proactively with some local authorities on the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities.  A practical output from this approach is an innovative partnership with Fingal County Council.  Under the terms of the agreement and based on the Department's school planning projections, Fingal County Council will identify and acquire appropriate sites where schools with enhanced sporting, community and arts facilities will be built to the benefit of both the school and the wider community.  In practice, the Local Authority will identify the sites when adopting their Local Area Plans.  The Council will go on to acquire sufficient land as recommended by the Department on which an appropriate sized school or schools for that local area can then be built.  In an area such as west Dublin, the Department continually monitors the demand for primary education and takes a decision to purchase reserved sites and construct new schools as the need is determined.

The database project is linked to the development of an on-line claims system for schools for the processing of salary claims.  The online claims system project will be completed soon and then the primary pupil database will be progressed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	515	In order to ensure that children whose first language is not English can succeed at school, my Department gives additional support to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of teacher posts.  The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.Recent years have seen a significant rise in the number of language support posts being provided by my Department.  In the current school year there are more than 1,100 such teachers in our schools, at a cost of €67 million.  This compares with approximately 820 language support teachers last year and just 260 in the 2001/02 school year. Hence there has been more than a four-fold increase in language support posts over the past few years.  In addition to the fulltime posts approved, grants towards the cost of employing part-time teachers are paid to primary schools with between 3 and 13 eligible non-national pupils. In the 2005/06 school year, 409 schools sought grant aid under this provision.Between extra language support posts and grant aid, the level of support provided to schools to meet the needs of children whose first language is not English has increased dramatically in recent years.  Nonetheless I am very conscious of the pressures on schools that have large numbers of non-English speaking children enrolled.  I am determined to provide greater support for these schools.To that end, provision has been made in the 2007 Estimates for an extra 200 language support teachers in 2007.  A further 350 posts will be provided under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement between 2008 and 2009.  These extra posts will allow the current cap of 2 teachers per school to be reformed.While details as to the precise number of posts to be allocated at both levels in the current school year and the schools to which the posts will be allocated have yet to be finalised I can assure the Deputy that I will be anxious to ensure that the additional resources are properly targeted at those areas where they are most needed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The total annual amount paid in respect of fee-charging secondary schools is some €96 million.  Of this sum approximately €87 million relates to salaries and allowances of teachers.  The balance includes the Protestant Block Grant and funding towards support services such as secretarial and caretaking services and miscellaneous grants.The payment of teachers salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee-charging schools, which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions.  Teachers in fee-charging schools, irrespective of the denominational ethos of the school, are paid by the State.  This may well reflect a long standing pragmatism that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme.There are 55 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant.  The latter schools receive funding by way of the Protestant Block Grant, which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant persuasion to attend schools, which reflect their denominational ethos.  The Block Grant includes payments in respect of capitation and these schools also qualify for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant and secretarial and caretaking grants. Fee-charging schools not embraced by the Protestant Block Grant do not qualify for payment of capitation or related supports.I have no plans, at this stage, to withdraw State support for the payment of teachers in fee-charging schools.  This support has been a long standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments.

These actions include the establishment of a Development Unit at national level to coordinate, manage and carry out research and to develop guidelines for best practice in youth work and assist youth work organisations to implement same.  This initiative will be a key element in the development of youth work and is central to implementation of some 18 of the other actions proposed in the Plan.Having considered the options for the establishment of the Unit proposed by the NYWAC, I approved the establishment of the Unit on a pilot basis within the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM).  Discussions between my Department and the NUIM are ongoing on a number of matters including the drawing up a Memorandum of Agreement between my Department and the NUIM, the establishment of a Management Committee to oversee the management of the Unit, appropriate resourcing of the Unit (both human and financial) etc.  The advice of other interest groups is also being considered.  Terms of reference for the Unit will be developed by my Department in consultation with the relevant youth work interests.  There is provision in the 2007 estimates to further develop this unit.  In my view, this new Unit, in line with other such specialised units, has the potential to contribute significantly to the development of appropriate policies and initiatives that address the educational needs of our young people.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	521	My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them cater for students with special educational needs.  The supports in question include remedial and resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.There are currently approximately 1,854 whole time equivalent additional teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs at second level.  This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils.  In addition, there are approximately 1,365 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.The general allocation model at primary level is based on the premise that all primary schools have children with learning support or high incidence special educational needs.  Early intervention support at primary ensures that many children do not need additional support at second level.The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved.  Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support.  In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be more appropriate response.  Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios.  Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.Second level pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support from the remedial/learning support teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.  All second level schools in the free education /block grant schemes have an entitlement to an ex-quota teacher allocation in respect of remedial /learning support teaching and guidance provision.  There are currently a total of 534 wholetime equivalent remedial/learning support teachers and 684 wholetime equivalent guidance teachers in place at second level.My Department also allocates additional teacher support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and Vocational Education Committees to cater for pupils with special educational needs, including, where appropriate, pupils with dyslexia.  To qualify for additional teaching support, under this category, children must be assessed by a psychologist as being of average intelligence or higher and having a degree of learning disability specific to basic skills in reading, writing or mathematics which places them at or below the 2nd percentile on suitable, standardised, norm referenced tests.The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education Act, 2005.  With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs.  Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and/or special needs assistant support for the pupil.In accordance with the terms of circular letter M 10/94, pupils with dyslexia may also, depending on an educational assessment, meet the criteria for exemption from the learning of the Irish Language on the grounds of having a learning disability.  Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the Certificate Examinations.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 145 together.On the 1 February 2006 the Minister for Health and Children and I published the report of the Fottrell Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training.  As part of these reforms I am increasing the annual number of undergraduate places for Irish and EU students from 305 to 485.  I am also introducing a separate graduate entry stream which will provide 240 additional places per annum.  These increases, which will be phased in over a five year period, will increase the annual number of medical places from 305 to 725.The Higher Education Authority has recently issued a competitive call for proposals to provide the new graduate entry programme, with a view to additional places being provided on this programme from 2007.  It has been decided that graduate entry will be open to graduates of honours bachelor degrees.  The provision of a graduate entry stream is an important development in reducing pressures on aspiring medical students who until now have effectively had one chance of entry, based on their Leaving Certificate performance.  This will allow students to make a decision to enter medicine at a more mature age and should result in a more diverse range of entrants into the profession.  No decisions have been made on the level of tuition fees for the graduate programme as this will form part of the overall outcome of the competitive call for proposals.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 142 together.The Deputies will be aware that, in accordance with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education.  This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most. This is part of my overall plan to introduce service improvements in the administration of the student grant schemes. These will include guaranteed timeframes for the earlier payment of grants, an independent appeals procedure and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments.To effect these administrative and service improvements requires the introduction of a new statutory basis for the scheme to replace the existing arrangements which involve a mix of statutory and non-statutory administrative schemes. Accordingly, the Government has approved the drafting of a new Student Support Bill which will place all student support schemes on a statutory footing for the first time, including providing for the designation of an appropriate awarding authority and for the general basis on which grants will be awarded to eligible students.Work on the Bill is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill in early 2007.  My Department has, as I have indicated previously, engaged in substantial consultations with the key stakeholders, including students in order to map the most logical and effective arrangements for the future structure and administration of the student support schemes.  This process of consultation is on-going. Implementation of the Bill when enacted, will take place in consultation with the relevant stakeholders to ensure an orderly transition and minimise disruption to students.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The Deputy will be aware that, in September 2005 my Department introduced a new system of teacher allocation to all mainstream primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, that is, pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, including those with difficulties in maths.It is a matter for the individual school to use its professional judgement to identify pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.  My Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05 to schools which provides guidelines on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect. The circular contains advice on how best to meet the needs of pupils with difficulties in either reading or mathematics, irrespective of gender. It is anticipated that a review of the general allocation model will be undertaken after three years of operation and I have no plans to alter the system in advance of the review.

This comprised 428 stand-alone subject inspections and 232 subject inspections as part of whole-school evaluations. By the end of 2006 the evaluation phase of the subject inspection process will have been completed in all of the 660 subject inspections planned. 389 of these subject inspections will have been issued to schools by the end of December 2006. The remainder will issue to schools and be published on the Department's website in early 2007 in accordance with the agreed timeframe for the publication of subject inspection reports.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	526	There are currently 5 post-primary and 11 primary schools in the general Lucan area. The position regarding major school building projects in the area is as follows:St Marys Primary School, Woodview — The proposed extension project for this school is to provide additional accommodation to cater for 24 classrooms plus ancillary accommodation. The project is at an early stage of architectural planning. The schools Design Team has been instructed to prepare a stage 1, 2 submission (site suitability/sketch scheme).Adamstown Community College — This is a Design and Build new school project to cater for 1,000 pupils. A stage 3 report has been reviewed by my Department's technical team and their comments sent to the developer. When these comments are addressed and a response received, my officials will evaluate the documentation.St Josephs College, Lucan — The proposed refurbishment project for this school is at an early stage of architectural planning. The project was approved to proceed to stage 3 (Dev sketch scheme) in October 2006. When the complete stage 3 submission is received in my Department, my Officials will arrange a meeting with the School's Design Team in order to evaluate the documentation.Adamstown Primary School — Construction has recently commenced on 2 sixteen classroom schools one is scheduled to be ready for September 2007 and the other for late 2007.Gaelscoil Naomh Pádraig — Construction was recently completed on 8 classrooms plus ancillary accommodation to bring this school up to a sixteen classroom schoolScoil Mhuire — A revised stage 3 for the construction of 3 classrooms plus some ancillary accommodation plus upgrading of the M & E is awaited. When this extension is completed the school will have 24 classrooms.Building projects for Coláiste Cois Life and Balgaddy Senior Primary school were recently completed.I recently gave the ahead to start architectural planning for building and modernisation works at Lucan Community School, Balgaddy Junior School, St. Thomas N.S. and Scoil Áine N.S.My Department monitors the school needs of the Lucan area on a regular basis and will continue to do so in order that any newly emerging needs can be addressed as expeditiously as possible.It is evident from the above that my Department has and is continuing to make a major investment in school infrastructure in the Lucan area. This has been facilitated by a record investment by the Government of over €2 billion in school infrastructure in the period from 2000 to 2005, which enabled my Department to deliver over 6500 projects nationally in that period. An additional 1,300 building projects will be carried out under my Department's Capital Programme this year alone.The infrastructural investment needs in schools will continue into the future. However, I am confident that the allocation from Government of €3.9 billion in capital funding for the education sector over the next 5 years will enable my Department to continue to take a pro-active approach in modernising existing schools and providing additional accommodation where required throughout the country.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	527	The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the total amount of money spent on buying and leasing prefabs in the 2005 to 2006 school year is not available in the format requested by the Deputy.  Records are maintained on a financial year basis as distinct from a school year as sought by the Deputy.  Details in relation to the cost of providing temporary accommodation (including the provision of prefabs) for 2005 to end of October 2006 is outlined in the following table.As the Deputy will see from the following table the spend on temporary accommodation represents a very small fraction of the overall yearly spend on school buildings. The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools. The provision of rented accommodation provides an immediate solution to a deficit of school accommodation, and is often the only available option where extra accommodation is needed at short notice.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	528	The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established under statute in 2002 to provide financial redress to victims of child abuse in residential institutions in order to assist them in their recovery and enhance the quality of the remainder of their lives. The Board received 14,541 applications by the 15th of December, 2005, the closing date for receipt of applications. My Department has included a contingency provision of up to €1.3 billion for the total liability potentially arising from the scheme in the notes to the 2005 Appropriation Accounts. This was based on the total number of applications to the Board, a cumulative average award of €76,000 at end 2005 and estimated legal and administrative costs of approximately 20% of awards.The final cost of the scheme must be viewed in the context of the Government apology to the victims of abuse and the very substantial costs that would have been incurred in any event if no such scheme had been established and if cases had been processed in the normal manner through the courts.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	529	As the Deputy will be aware, there are now no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Furthermore, there are nearly 7,000 more primary teachers than there were in 1997. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. The number of children in large classes has been significantly reduced. When this Government first came into office, there were more than 52,000 children in classes of 35 and over — five times the number that there were in the last school year. There were also more than 1,900 children in classes of 40 and over — compared to just over 200 in 05/06.While I appreciate the need to make further progress in reducing class size, it should be acknowledged just how much has been achieved. In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those that need help with their English.  Special education provision in particular has undergone a level of expansion the extent of which nobody could have predicted a few years ago — and this was only right. If we had put all 4,000 of the teachers hired since 2002 into classroom teaching, our average class size would be a lot smaller than it is now. But we would have done a great disservice to those children who need extra help the most. I am sure the Deputy would accept that we have taken the right approach.Now that children with special needs are finally getting the support they deserve, we are providing extra teachers this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule. This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year, we are committed to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.We also acted this year to specifically address the needs of growing schools by making it easier to qualify for a developing school post. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned for the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06. This change specifically addressed the needs of schools which are seeing large increases in their enrolments year on year. The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled but we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 149 together.I wish to inform the Deputy that the Higher Diploma programmes for post-primary teacher training provide the necessary skills to mitigate and resolve conflict as it occurs in the classroom and school setting. Conflict resolution is integral to all aspects of the education programme which aims to support teachers as developers and builders of a learning environment in the classroom setting and in the school as a learning community. Specific lectures on conflict resolution are included in the Higher Diploma programmes.  However, the subject has many overlaps with other aspects of the programme and it is addressed specifically in areas such as classroom management, practical workshops, tutorials which, on average, amounts to 42 hours.  The issue of conflict resolution also forms part of the teaching practice element of the programme.My Department continues to support teachers in schools to address conflict in a changing school environment as part of the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) Programme at Junior Certificate level.  The support is provided by a dedicated team of seconded teachers and approximately 2,500 teachers have attended SPHE in-service over the past 6 years.  The SPHE curriculum is mandatory in all primary schools and post-primary schools up to Junior Certificate Level in which substance use is one of 10 modules taught.  During 2005/2006, over 900 post-primary teachers attended in-service programmes at their local Education Centre where conflict resolution was a component.In addition, my Department provides a range of support to Principals and Deputy Principals in the area of conflict management as part of the Leadership Development in Schools, the School Development Planning Initiative and the Special Education Support Service.  I recently established the National Behavioural Support Service (NBSS) which will address issues relating to student behaviour in post-primary schools, including training in conflict resolution techniques. At Primary level, my Department provides continuing professional development support through the Primary Curriculum Support Programme which deals with the revised Primary Curriculum.  As part of its remit, support is provided to teachers on conflict resolution in the context of training in the areas of classroom management and Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE).Continuous professional development is also provided on conflict resolution in the context of training provided by a number of Support Services working with all primary schools: School Leadership Development, School Development Planning Service and the Special Education Support Service.  Furthermore, over 5,300 primary teachers attended in-service programmes at their local Education Centre where conflict resolution was a component during 2005/2006.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Young people in the children detention schools attend school and receive tuition in curricular areas, including literacy, in keeping with their needs and age.  These schools are monitored by my Department's inspectorate and, like all schools, are subject to Whole School Evaluation. The monitoring of individual student progress is a matter for the teaching staff of each school. Arising from a review of youth justice provisions, the Government last year approved a package of measures designed to restructure and streamline the delivery of the State's services in this area.  As part of this package, my Department is drawing up an education strategy in order to ensure a continuum of education and training opportunities for young people in children detention schools, special care units and high support units.The strategy will deal with the education and training provision for such young people before, during and after any periods in special care or detention. It will reflect the key role played by education in shaping the lives of these young people and encourage them to assume a positive role in society.  Work on the preparation of the strategy is underway.The Deputy should note that literacy in adult detention centres is a matter for the Irish Prison Service and arrangements are being made for that Service to respond directly to the Deputy in that regard.

Recent thinking on ICT in schools is that the best way to learn ICT skills is to apply them in a meaningful context. Based on this, the focus in Ireland is on developing and promoting the use of ICT as a tool for teaching and learning across the curriculum.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	533	My Department commenced a Radon Remediation Programme in 1998 when it commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to conduct a survey of radon levels in all primary and post primary schools.  The programme initially involved surveying radon levels in schools and subsequently carrying out mitigation works where appropriate. The programme is 100% funded by my Department and has cost approximately €6m to date.All schools have been advised of the programme and where excess radon levels are located, funding is provided for the mitigation works. Follow-up monitoring also takes place to ensure that the remediation action has been successful.The remaining handful of schools who have not agreed to participate in the radon surveys are regularly advised of the need to do so. Radon barriers are included in the design of all new school building projects.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	534	As the Deputy will be aware, the Schools Broadband Programme provides broadband internet access to Primary and Post Primary schools and includes Content Filtering as an integral part of the service.  The Content Filtering service is designed to control the level of access from schools, via the broadband network, to the wider internet. It does this by categorising websites under various categories and providing content filtering ‘options' to schools which allow or block a combination of these website categories.  Based on information and advice provided by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), the schools themselves decide on which content filtering option is most appropriate to school needs and confirm this to the NCTE.  This option is then set up for the school. Currently two options have been implemented for schools.  However, this may change based on the feedback from schools and responding to schools requirements.The Content Filtering service also implements a white list and blacklist policy. Websites which are categorised as appropriate for all schools are placed on a white list.  In contrast, websites which are categorised as non-appropriate for all schools are placed on a black list.  No school is connected to the internet via the schools broadband network unless it has confirmed in writing: a) an Internet Acceptable Usage Policy in place and b) its Content Filtering option to the NCTE.  Content Filtering is a technology based service that assists in the management of websites for schools. Along with education / awareness and supervision it forms the basis of implementing a safe environment for pupils in schools.The National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) actively provides support and guidelines to schools regarding the use of the Information and Communication Technologies.  Through its internet safety initiative the NCTE launched Webwise.ie, which creates awareness about new technologies and possible risks associated with their use by young people. The site provides tools and information to empower users on how to avoid or deal with these risks; in particular the advice given is technology independent reducing the number of messages a student needs to remember. In addition, the Internet Advisory Board is working in this area.The NCTE has also published guidelines in relation to other information and communications technologies. For example, ‘ICT Planning and Advice for Schools' highlights the educational potential of mobile phones and a copy of this pack was distributed to all schools and is available online at http://advicesheets.ncte.ie/ mobilephones/. It refers to the management of mobile phone use by students as an important issue and must be incorporated into the school’s ICT Plan and Acceptable Use Policy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	535	A special once-off grant of €40,000 was paid to Educate Together in 2005 bringing their total grant in that year to over €81,000. In 2006 the funding provided to Educate Together was increased almost threefold to €120,000.In making their case for funding to me Educate Together also raised the issue for support for newly establishing schools. To support such schools I introduced a new grant of €10,000 payable in two instalments of €5,000 for the Boards of Management of newly establishing schools in respect of training of the Boards of Management and staff of those schools in their initial years.This grant is in addition to the existing start-up grant of €6,348.69 which has been available to all new primary schools, including Educate Together schools, which began operating from 1st September, 2000 onwards.With regard to training of school boards of management generally, it is open to the School Management Bodies to apply to my Department for funding for this purpose.My Department has supported the establishment of a significant number of new multi-denominational schools in recent years. Of the 34 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past four years alone, 14 are multi-denominational.Many multi-denominational primary schools are established in areas of rapidly expanding population growth. School Building projects in these areas are assigned a Band 1 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. This is the highest band rating possible which results in the delivery of permanent accommodation in the shortest timeframe achievable. Pending the delivery of new school buildings, the Department contributes 95% towards the cost of renting of temporary accommodation for schools with permanent recognition. The local contribution for a school in such circumstances is capped at €3,175 per annum.To underpin the establishment of new schools, my Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have assisted patron bodies in the provision of accommodation. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by the patron body for multi-denominational schools, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for state-owned school buildings, which had cost up to €63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster.Standard/generic designs have also been developed by the Building Unit of my Department for 8 and 16 classroom schools. It is expected that use of these designs, wherever possible, will yield substantial savings in terms of design team fees as well as reducing the time taken to bring new school projects to completion.I am satisfied that the range of measures now in place, including the almost threefold increase in their grant, provides a comprehensive response to the request made for additional support for Educate Together and their schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	536	A range of components in the Leaving Certificate examinations already take place prior to June. For example, coursework in Home Economics Scientific and Social is required to be completed by November. The Engineering project is required to be completed in March, and the oral examinations are completed in April, in addition to the LCVP Link Modules portfolio, the practical coursework elements of Religion, History and Geography, Agricultural Science, and Agricultural Economics, elective coursework in Home Economics, the practical component of Music and the Construction Studies Project. The practical examination in Engineering, Construction, Art and the elective in composing in Music take place in May as well as the written examination for the LCVOP Link Modules.The Leaving Certificate Applied programme also provides for completion of assessment components throughout the cycle.I am acutely aware of the importance of ensuring a spread of assessment points, and of the need to move away from the heavy demand placed on students in the June terminal examinations. I asked the State Examinations Commission to discuss this issue with the partners in education to see how it might best be addressed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	537	Responsibility for arranging insurance cover, including the specific requirements of insurance cover for school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary and post-primary schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools receive from my Department.My Department provides funding to schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to primary and post-primary schools. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level was increased from €57.14 per pupil to €145.58 with effect from 1st January, 2006.  From 1st January next the standard per capita grant will be increased by a further €18 per pupil bringing the overall capitation grant per pupil at primary level to €163.58. This will represent an increase of 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.In addition, the already enhanced rates of capitation grant payable in respect of certain categories of special needs pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes in ordinary national schools are being substantially increased with effect from 1st January 2007.  There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools also. In addition to the €12 per pupil increase in 2006 in the standard per capita grant that now stands at €298 per pupil, voluntary secondary schools have benefited additionally by the increase of €14 per pupil in 2006 in the support services grant bringing the overall grant to €159 per pupil.In addition to the increases in the standard per capita grant rates outlined above, the per capita grant at post-primary level will also be increased by €18 per pupil bringing the overall capitation grant for post-primary pupils to €316. The support services grant will also be increased by a further €30 for voluntary secondary schools, which includes a further equalisation measure, to €189 per pupil. For such schools this cumulative increase of €48 per pupil will bring the aggregate grant to over €500 per pupil from 1 January next. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this will bring annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €290,000. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. These significant increases in the funding of primary and post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	538	Planning for whole-school evaluations (WSE) in 2007 in primary schools, post-primary schools and centres for education is underway at present, and will be finalised within a few weeks. It is expected that over 300 WSEs will be conducted during 2007. This will include approximately 230 WSEs at primary level, 60 WSEs in post-primary schools and 15 WSEs in other centres for education.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	539	There are approximately 270 cases before the Courts which involve the Department as a Defendant or Respondent. They include litigation relating to Primary Schools, Community and Comprehensive Schools, Children Detention Schools, Special Needs, school non-attendance, school transport, litigation arising from industrial relations actions, contractual disputes and a diverse range of matters.This figure does not include childhood abuse cases relating to industrial and reformatory schools and residential Institutions, which number approximately 695 live cases. These are being dealt with primarily by the Residential Institutions Redress Board. However, it is not possible to indicate what percentage of these cases will reach a hearing, as a large number of cases are discontinued following the acceptance by the plaintiffs of awards made by the Redress Board.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age and Rule 64 (1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least 4 years of age before she/he may be enrolled in a National School. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to my Department.   A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, my Department may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.  The existence of an appeals procedure serves to ensure that schools abide by their enrolment policies.Details on appealing decisions on enrolment under section 29 of the Education Act are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Regarding implementation of the resource guide in question by organisations in the youth sector, the position is that publication of the resource is to be welcomed and it complements existing resources available in this sector under the National Youth Health Programme operated by the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI).In relation to schools, the Deputy will be aware that every school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour. This policy should be developed within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.In view of the increasing demands which have been placed on schools as a result of statutory obligations and the requirement for policies in a range of areas, my Department has been working to ensure greater availability of guidelines and template policies to assist schools. In August of this year, I announced the publication on my Department's website of policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying, as part of our ongoing efforts in this regard. The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies.The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour, 1993. However, it does take account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is at present developing guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. Once the NEWB Guidelines are in place, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. The issue of homophobic bullying will be further addressed in this context and resources such as the Pobal Guide will help to inform this review process.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 to 169, inclusive, together.I refer the Deputy to my replies to Written Questions No. 132 to 136 from Deputy Rabbitte on 5 July 2006, Written Question No. 221 from Deputy Gormley on 27 September and Written Questions Nos. 177 and 178 from Deputy Sargent on 14 November. It is not the practice of the Office to identify the drafters of individual Acts of the Oireachtas. Many drafting projects are undertaken by more than one drafter.Permanent members of staff in the Office are assigned drafting projects commensurate with their experience. Taking account of the demands of the Government Legislation Programme and the requirement to draft complex Bills urgently, every effort is made to assign a variety of drafting projects to all drafters. There was a promotion to Assistant Parliamentary Counsel I in September 2003. The position about further promotions is regularly reviewed. Promotions are based on merit as is the case across the civil service. Potential candidates have to meet the required standards to be promoted. The practice of engaging drafters on contract began in the early 1980s.  All Contract Drafters engaged by the Office have significant drafting experience in common-law jurisdictions similar to our own.  In the past, all have previously held senior drafting positions including former heads of office of the UK Office of Parliamentary Counsel, the Canadian Federal Drafting Office and the Office of the Scottish Parliamentary Counsel.  The use of these drafters enables the Office to meet the demands of the Government's Legislation Programme while ensuring that the newer drafters receive extensive training.  Newer drafters work with more senior colleagues, including contract staff, and thus receive in-depth and wide ranging experience.  Indeed, without the assistance of the contract staff the more experienced permanent drafters would find it impossible to train newer staff without having to decrease their involvement in the preparation of legislation.In engaging contract drafters, the Office has, in accordance with agreed procedures, informed the relevant Union which represents permanent drafters of its intentions to do so in each case.  I should emphasise that the engagement of contract drafters does not impact on the experience opportunities available to permanent drafters to gain appropriate drafting experience.In many common law jurisdictions, there are non-indigenous drafters preparing legislation. Indeed, the head of the drafting office in the State of Victoria in Australia is a native of Northern Ireland who commenced his drafting career in the Office of the Legislative Counsel in Belfast. Also, some of the permanent members of staff of the OPC have worked in other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Gibraltar and the Channel Islands.

The Underlying Cause of Death is defined as a) ‘the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death', or b) ‘the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury'. Deaths are coded according to the Ninth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (I.C.D. 9). Thus, numbers of deaths where decubitus ulcers were the Underlying Cause of Death can readily be produced.However, data on diseases which were referred to on the death certificate but which were not the Underlying Cause of Death are not retained on CSO systems. To produce statistics retrospectively on numbers of death certificates containing a reference to decubitus ulcers would involve manually re-examining each death certificate. The Central Statistics Office currently retains death certificates from 2002 to date. Death certificates prior to 2002 are held by the General Register Office.Statistics on the place of death are produced on the basis of a textual description of the place of death which is subsequently coded within the CSO according to the following classification:1. Hospital2. Local Health Board Institutions3. Private Homes4. Rotunda, Holles Street and Coombe5. Homes for the Aged, Community Care, and Hospices6. Mental Hospital7. Domiciliary8. Elsewhere.There is no specific category within the classification for Nursing Homes. Some will be included in category ‘1. Local Health Board Institutions', ‘4. Private Homes' and ‘6. Homes for the Aged, Community Care and Hospices'. Thus, numbers of deaths in nursing homes cannot currently be produced without a manual re-examination of the death certificate. However even a re-examination of the death certificate may not facilitate the identification of all nursing homes as the quality and level of information provided in the textual description may not be adequate to meet this requirement. In addition an exhaustive list of nursing homes would be required to aid the coding process.Note also that where a nursing home resident dies in a hospital, the place of death recorded will be the hospital. The residence of the deceased could potentially indicate whether or not the individual was being cared for in a nursing home prior to death. However no information on the length of stay in the hospital is available and therefore it would not be possible to identify if the decubitus ulcers occurred in the nursing home or in the hospital.

Any further time frame involved in the filling of posts for which vetting is required is solely a matter for the recruiting organisations, which are aware of this Garda processing time and have been advised to factor it into the recruitment and selection procedures.I do not accept the contention that there is ‘red tape' and a lack of co-ordination in inter-agency co-operation in the vetting process.Since the decentralisation of the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) in Thurles in November 2005, a significant streamlining of procedures to process vetting applications has occurred, and these have resulted in an improved service being provided to client organisations, including the HSE.  I understand that there is ongoing, close co-operation between the GCVU and the HSE in processing vetting applications and that both bodies are committed to maintaining close links on the issue.

As I have stated in the past, the Government is committed to developing North/South co-operation across a full spectrum of areas and we will continue to promote closer cooperation between the two jurisdictions wherever it will prove beneficial to the people of this island.I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are high levels of cooperation between UK and Irish police forces in relation to the investigation of missing persons in both jurisdictions.  Media outlets, print, radio and television are used to highlight cases involving missing persons, as appropriate.  All cases of persons reported missing in suspicious circumstances are subject to ongoing review and investigation.  The services of other external agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation.The missing children website, www.missingkids.ie is a joint initiative between the Garda Síochána and the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.  This website enables the Garda Síochána to circulate instantaneously and internationally written details and high quality photographs of children reported missing to other police forces.

The Garda Youth Diversion Projects are funded by my Department and administered through the Community Relations Section of An Garda Síochána.The allocation of funding for the 74 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (along with 7 Local Drug Task Force Projects) in 2006 is just over €6.6 million, which is an increase of €1.2 million on 2005.  I have also secured an increase in funding to €9.8 million for 2007.It is my intention to ensure that 100 projects will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.  In the first phase of this expansion, ten new projects were established this year and they are located in Birr, Blanchardstown, Carlow, Castlebar, Cavan, Clondalkin, Limerick, Tallaght and Tralee (two projects).  I have recently announced my approval to establish a further ten projects in the second phase of the expansion programme.  These projects will be located in Ballyogan, Dublin 18, Carrick-on-Suir, Castleisland, Celbridge, Kilrush, Listowel, Mallow, New Ross, Tipperary Town and Tuam.The Garda Commissioner brings forward proposals for the establishment of new Garda Youth Diversion Projects.  The locations for establishing new Garda Youth Diversion Projects are selected on the basis of factors including an increase in the level of juvenile crime in the area and the number of young people referred to the Juvenile Diversion Programme.  Two proposals have been received by the Garda Commissioner to establish additional Garda Youth Diversion Projects in the area referred to by the Deputy and I am informed that these proposals are being considered in the context of the further expansion of the programme in 2007 and in light of the funding available.

I am assured that  the Garda Síochána urges all members of the public to report any matters of a criminal nature for investigation by them.  The problems of unreported and unrecorded crime are well documented in the international criminological literature, and are in no way unique to this country.  Furthermore, the introduction of PULSE has improved the accuracy and comprehensiveness of Garda statistics — for example, the system demands that incidents now have to be recorded before particular actions can be taken.In relation to the crime situation in the Moyross and Southill area of Limerick City, I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of serious criminal incidents which have occurred in the Moyross  and Southill areas of Limerick City have been the subject and focus of much media attention both locally and nationally.  The Garda authorities in Limerick have an excellent  record in the investigation of serious crime.  A significant effort has been made by local Garda management to address the ongoing serious crime situations that have developed in these areas during the past few months and additional resources have been deployed to perform additional patrols in both the Moyross and Southill areas to target criminality in certain areas of Limerick City.Garda initiatives are continually being planned to target the activities of criminal elements in the City, these initiatives have shown considerable success.  As a result of these initiatives 70 firearms and ammunition seizures have taken place and quantities of drugs (cocaine, heroin, cannabis resin, ecstasy) have been recovered.  I am assured that the Garda authorities will continue to deliver a quality policing service in targeting those involved in criminal activity.

Key variables may not have taken place at the time information is being provided to the Garda Síochána but may commence before the end of the accounting period.  This could include incidents subsequently detected, or where directions to charge or otherwise are received from the Law Officers and where proceedings may commence or be finalised resulting in conviction or otherwise.Furthermore, a criminal offence may be reclassified in the course of an investigation, for example, an incident which is recorded as murder may be reclassified as manslaughter during the course of an investigation as the body of relevant evidence comes to light or following receipt of the Law Officer's directions.

The NDVIA pursued work separately with the Garda; the Courts Service; the Probation and Welfare Service; and the Health Services Executive local services in relation to appropriate responses and methodologies for supporting the victims of domestic violence and also actively promoted the co-ordination of the responses among all the relevant services in the pilot area.The FGS evaluation reported that some useful work was undertaken by the NDVIA in the pilot programme, although, despite the extensions, the full programme of work had not been completed by the end of the pilot period.My Department reviewed the Evaluator's report and agreed to provide additional funding to the NDVIA during 2006, so that the NDVIA could complete the unfinished tasks in the pilot project and write up all the processes involved, so that they might be considered for implementation in other areas if the final outcomes are deemed appropriate.  The NDVIA has now undertaken to complete the pilot project by the end of January, 2007.Overall grant funding of €530,024 has been provided to the NDVIA to date.  When this pilot project is fully completed, my Department will be in a position to further consider the final outcomes of the project and the findings of the FGS evaluation and to make informed decisions on its role in this area in the future.

I would, however, refer him to my recent response to questions number 93 and 148 of 7 November 2006 (35573/06) which addressed the role of the Coroners in the specific context of MRSA related deaths and which also set out the current position with respect to the forthcoming Coroners Bill.

All applications for payments are assessed in accordance with the criteria set out in the Scheme.  The person referred to by the Deputy has received payments for medical expenses incurred to date and has, in addition, received the exceptional payment for medical expenses provided for under the Scheme.I have been informed that the Commission will continue to meet this person's medical expenses, in so far as they relate to the injuries received in the conflict, as they arise under the terms of the Scheme and will sympathetically consider all applications from him.  I also understand that the correspondence referred to by the Deputy is being dealt with by the Commission.

The decision of the Visa Officer to refuse this application was taken on 18 September 2006.  The application was refused on the grounds that the applicant had shown no clear link to the reference in Ireland.  Also, the deciding Visa Officer was not satisfied that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa.The decision was appealed on 10 October 2006.  Following a re-examination of the case, the decision to refuse was upheld on 21 October 2006.  As each applicant is entitled to one appeal only, no further review in this matter can be granted; however it is open to the applicant to make a fresh application.  Comprehensive guidelines on making a visa application are available on my Department's website.

The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension.  In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  I understand that applications received in May 2006 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137.  The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Ardfinnan Garda Station as at 27 November, 2006 was one.  Ardfinnan forms part of the Cahir District.  The personnel strength of Cahir District as at 31 December 1997 was 38 (all ranks).  The personnel strength of Cahir District as at 27 November 2006 was 52 (all ranks).  This represents an increase of 14 (or 36.84%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.Resources are augmented from within the Division/District as required. Local Garda Management report that the area is also patrolled by the District Detective Unit and the Divisional Traffic Unit.  I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.

There are approximately 2,600 Neighbourhood Watch schemes in operation throughout the country.  Since its establishment, the Garda authorities have sought to encourage the active participation of the public in Neighbourhood Watch by encouraging and supporting communities to establish and maintain such initiatives.  The Garda Síochána has been a strategic partner in driving and supporting Neighbourhood Watch through its Community Relations Section and local Garda management and has deployed Crime Prevention Officers and Liaison Gardaí to assist schemes.In relation to the provision of funding for Neighbourhood Watch organisations, I am strongly of the view that voluntary community organisations have, through their support for and work with the Garda Síochána, an important role to play in crime prevention and the promotion of community safety.  I very much support the work being carried out by Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert schemes throughout the country.The Garda authorities are finalising a high level review of Neighbourhood Watch which involved consultation with all the relevant stakeholders.  Following completion of the review, a strategy for the future development of Neighbourhood Watch will provide a blueprint for its future development in the context of which the issue of funding for the groups will be addressed.

It is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The Operation remains in place and is on-going in the DMR.Operation Anvil was extended nationwide during 2006 and consists of a series of special operations, proposed by each Regional Assistant Commissioner, which are designed to focus on areas where there is a high incidence of crime.  The Operation outside the DMR is significantly different from that in the DMR, in that initiatives have a short time-focus and are designed to address the particular needs of specific areas.  A number of operations have been completed, while further operations are on-going.  The methodologies utilised in doing this vary from area to area and from time to time, commensurate with the assessed need.  For these reasons there is no comparable system in place for the systematic collation of statistical data in these Garda Regions.Operation Anvil has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in recorded crime in the target crime areas under the operation.  In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.  Operation Anvil will continue to be funded to the extent and as long as the Commissioner considers that it is necessary to do so and it is fulfilling its objectives.The following tables show the successes of Operation Anvil up to 19 November, 2006.Number€ArrestsMurder56Burglary1,701Robbery offences796Serious assaults796Theft from shops*584Theft from MPV*66Theft other*129Total Arrests4,128SearchesDrugs19,390Thefts1,872Firearms1,291Total Searches22,553SeizuresFirearms549Section 41 (Road Traffic Act)7,779Total Seizures8,328Number of Checkpoints Performed41,871Value of property recovered13,990,197* Figures commenced from 25 September 2006.NumberArrests2,595Firearms seized238

It should be noted that there is no automatic entitlement to residency in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.  However, I do consider applications which are made in writing to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department for permission to remain in the State on this separate basis.  There is no record that the person in question ever made an application for residency in the State on this basis or received an endorsement in her passport to show that she had been granted permission to remain in the State.It is also a further requirement under section 9 of the above mentioned Act that all non-EU nationals must register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau and receive a Certificate of Registration as evidence of that registration.   Prior to the enactment of the 2004 Immigration Act the person concerned was not required to register her presence in the State but is now required to fulfil that obligation.  For the record, the person in question is not currently registered and is not in possession of a Certificate of Registration as required by the Act.When the person concerned was stopped by the Immigration Officers in Shannon she would have been advised that she was not in compliance with her legal obligations to register and have permission to remain in the State.  The person in question should now regularise her status in the State by making an application for residency to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.

The visit is immediately terminated and the visitor removed from the area. Gardaí may be called with a view to prosecuting the persons concerned. In such instances, retrieved substances are handed over to Gardaí and any resulting sanctions are a matter for the courts.  The prisoner concerned is searched as a standard operational procedure. In addition, the prisoner may be placed on a disciplinary report for a breach of the Prison Rules.Retrieval of prohibited substances such as drugs (or suspected drugs) is recorded under the generic description of "prohibited articles/substances" and not classified separately. As the seizure of such substances may arise from different situations, records are maintained in different sources, for example, a prisoner disciplinary report on his/her file, an incident log, or in the visiting area records.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that the exact nature of any contraband intercepted can only be established following chemical analysis.

This Bill will comply with the EU Framework Decision on combating trafficking in persons for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation and will also fulfil the criminal law requirements of two other international trafficking instruments, the Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, which supplements the UN Convention against transnational organised crime and the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings.  However, the Bill will be more comprehensive than only dealing with trafficking issues; it will also provide greater protection to vulnerable persons against sexual abuse and generally keep our legislation in that respect up to date. In that it will, inter alia, provide for compliance with a second EU Framework Decision negotiated after the trafficking instrument, that is, the Framework Decision combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.

The maximum sentence on conviction is life imprisonment.  Under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, it is an offence to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into Ireland of a person who is reasonably believed to be an illegal immigrant or a person who intends to claim asylum. In this case the maximum prison sentence is 10 years.Legislation creating an offence of trafficking in persons for the specific purpose of sexual or labour exploitation is contained in the draft Criminal Justice (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill.  This Bill will comply with the EU Framework Decision on combating trafficking in persons for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation and will also fully comply with the criminal law requirements of the Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, which supplements the UN Convention against transnational organised crime and the Council of Europe Convention against trafficking in human beings.  The proposals contained in the Bill have been approved by Government and are currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.More generally, Ireland's position as regards the Convention on Trafficking is under consideration at present.  It is important to separate the issues of how Ireland deals with victims of trafficking from that of signature of the various international instruments in this area.  The current Irish immigration system allows the authorities to deal with the victims of trafficking in a sympathetic and pragmatic way.  Our non-participation to date in the international instruments referred to is not  having a negative impact on victims who come to notice here. Any necessary assistance is provided to victims by the services of the State.

These patrols are backed up by Divisional Garda Units, including the Traffic Corps, Mountain Bike Unit, Drug Task Force and the District and Divisional Detective Units.  I understand that Gardaí attached to the Community Policing Unit have a good relationship with the local community.I understand that current policing plans in the area are predicated on the prevention of anti-social and public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents.  This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area.I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is not aware of any specific problem with serious car crime and associated anti-social behaviour, in particular so-called joy-riding in the location mentioned, but will take all necessary actions if such problems arise.

I understand that instructions relating to the recording of incidents involving domestic violence were issued by the Garda authorities earlier this year and the operation of this policy will be continually monitored.Statistics relating to the number of breaches of Court Orders issued under domestic violence legislation have been published in the Garda Annual Report since 2004.  The legislation governing the exemption does not allow for the financial or individual circumstances of the owner in question to be taken into account.  Similarly, as the daughter does not appear to be a dependent relative her use of the property would not be taken into account.  The Deputy should contact the Revenue Commissioners if he would like more specific information on the extent to which the exemption would apply to the homeowner in question.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	591	In "Towards 2016", the social partners agreed that work should continue on outstanding public service pension reform issues.  These issues form part of a programme of actual and proposed changes over recent years which is largely based on the recommendations in 2000 of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which were accepted in principle by Government.As indicated in my reply to Question number 32965/06 from Deputy Ivor Callely on 17 October 2006, this reform process has already accomplished substantial change in public service pension provision in Ireland.  In this context the major cost saving measure has been the implementation, via the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, of the Commission recommendation to raise the general minimum pension age of new entrants to the public service from 60 to 65 years.In September 2004, following discussions with ICTU, it was announced that Government had ratified an agreed approach to the remaining Commission recommendations.  The key feature of the Government decision was the immediate authorisation for implementation of the following six Commission recommendations directed at modernising pension provision:1. Introduction of cost-neutral early retirement: A facility to allow public servants to retire early (from age 50/55, as appropriate) with immediate payment of pension and lump sum, actuarially reduced to reflect the earlier payment.2. Revised integration formula: New method of integrating social insurance and public service pensions to boost retirement income of lower-paid staff.3. Integration "pro rata": A more favourable integration method ("pro rata" integration as opposed to "full" integration) to be used in calculating the pension entitlements of part-time public servants.4. Notional added years: Existing schemes to be replaced for new entrants by a single "transitional" scheme (to be reviewed in 2015), the main impact of the change being to reduce gross awards from 10 to 5 years.5. Compound interest rate: The rate on pension-related repayments such as marriage gratuity to be cut from 6% to 4%.6. Reckoning of allowances for pension purposes: Calculation to be based on "the best three consecutive years in the ten years preceding retirement" instead of being restricted to the last three years of service only.Five of these six reforms have already taken effect, having been implemented by means of Department of Finance circulars issued in 2005.  It is hoped that the outstanding item, the reckoning of allowances for pension purposes, will also be implemented shortly by way of a Department of Finance circular.  The September 2004 Government announcement also provided that other Commission recommendations would be considered further.  In particular it identified the following two issues for active consideration:1. Changes to Spouses' and Children's Schemes: The proposed Commission changes include the extension of benefits to non-spousal partners.  The feasibility of implementing the changes is currently being examined by a management/union Working Group, whose work is at an advanced stage.2. SPEARS:  The Commission recommended the introduction of SPEARS; a single AVC-type pensions savings scheme for the entire public service.  This is the subject of ongoing management-union discussion.In "Towards 2016" theses two areas are specifically noted as being priority issues.

The relief is given to persons who at the date of execution of the deed have attained certain agricultural and educational standards or who subsequently attain such standards.  This relief was clawed back as the lands or part of the lands the subject of the relief were disposed of within 5 years from the date of execution of the instrument without the proceeds from the disposal being used in acquiring other lands within a period of one year of the date of the disposal.  The relief is in the form of a zero rate of stamp duty.New dwelling-house/apartment with floor-area certificate, Section 91 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  There were 266 cases amounting to €2,351,348 clawed back.  This relief is granted where the property has a floor area of less than 125 square metres, is occupied by the purchaser or by some person in right of the purchaser and is clawed back if the purchaser is in receipt of rent from the dwelling-house/apartment other than rent received under the rent-a-room scheme within 5 years of the date of execution of the deed.  The relief is in the form of a zero rate of stamp duty.New dwelling-house/apartment with no floor area certificate, Section 92 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  There were 43 cases amounting to €366,815 clawed back.  The relief is granted where the property has a floor area of greater than 125 square metres, is occupied by the purchaser or by some person in right of the purchaser and is clawed back if the purchaser is in receipt of any rent from the dwelling-house/apartment other than rent received under the rent-a-room scheme within 5 years of the date of execution of the deed.  The relief is applied by charging duty only on the value of the site or one quarter of the total value of the site plus building agreement, less VAT, whichever figure is the greater or on one quarter of the total consideration, less VAT where a completed house is being purchased.First time purchaser relief, Section 92B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  There were 72 cases amounting to €445,682 clawed back.  This relief is granted where the purchaser or purchasers at the date of execution of the deed had not individually or jointly with any other person or persons previously purchased another dwelling-house or apartment or part of another dwelling-house or apartment.  The relief is granted to owner occupiers or where the property is occupied by some person in right of the purchaser and is clawed back if the purchaser is in receipt of any rent from the dwelling-house/apartment other than rent under the rent-a-room scheme within 5 years of the date of execution of the deed.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 29 of the Finance Act, 2005 made provision to allow farmers to elect to have certain farm subsidy payments, otherwise taxable in 2005, spread over the three years 2005, 2006 and 2007 for income tax purposes.  The provision applied to individuals engaged in the trade of farming in the tax year 2005 who were in receipt of payments in 2005 under both the new EU Single Payment Scheme and the terminated FEOGA Schemes. It provided that a farmer could opt not to have the payments received in 2005 under the terminated FEOGA scheme taxed in full in that year but rather spread for tax purposes over the years 2005, 2006 and 2007.  The provision applies only to the year of assessment 2005.In most cases, receipts of the year 2005 were taxable in that year.  However, some farmers because of their choice of accounts year, are taxable in 2006 on certain amounts received in 2005.  There is no three year spread available to those farmers.  The person referred to by the Deputy seems, on the basis of the details supplied, to be such a farmer and to be outside the scope of the scheme.The scheme was specifically tailored to alleviate the position of those who would otherwise have to pay tax on both Single Farm Payments and FEOGA payments in the tax year 2005.  The person referred to by the Deputy has an accounts year ending in March.  The accounts year April 2004 to March 2005 would, therefore, form the basis for taxation in the tax year 2005. As both Single Farm Payments and FEOGA payments were not made in this accounts year (Single Farm Payments were not made until late 2005), the Finance Act 2005 measure does not apply to the person in question because that person was not subject to tax in the first place on both payments in the tax year 2005. On the basis of the information supplied, payments were made to the person in question in late, 2005 and, consequently, these were taxable in 2006, rather than 2005.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	595	I have received a submission on behalf of the Association in question and the contents will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget.  However I would like to explain to the Deputy the background to the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme.The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to certain limit) on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car up to a certain limit.The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  To get the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;(c) be without both hands or without both arms;(d) be without one or both legs;(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant Health Service Executive area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.  The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.  This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is an exemption from capital gains tax on gains made by an individual on the disposal of his/her dwelling house together with land occupied as its gardens or grounds up to an area of one acre.Full exemption applies where the dwelling house has been occupied by the individual as his/her principal private residence throughout his/her period of ownership.  Where the house is not so occupied during the whole period of ownership, the proportion of the gain applicable to the period of occupation is exempt.  This proportion is the same proportion as the length of the period of owner-occupation (inclusive of the last 12 months of ownership in any event) bears to the length of the period of ownership.  The exemption is restricted, however, where there is a sale of development land.Periods spent in employment abroad and periods of absence due to the situation of an individual's place of employment may be treated as periods of occupation of the residence.  The exemption may also apply where the house has been the sole residence of a dependent relative.The legislation governing the exemption does not allow for the financial or individual circumstances of the owner in question to be taken into account.  Similarly, as the daughter does not appear to be a dependent relative her use of the property would not be taken into account.  The Deputy should contact the Revenue Commissioners if he would like more specific information on the extent to which the exemption would apply to the homeowner in question.

They are also engaged in the evaluation of a number of accommodation proposals for an advance group of Revenue staff.  It is hoped that this evaluation will be completed shortly and allow for the advance group to decentralise in mid 2007.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	599	The standard VAT rate of 21% applies to condoms.  Under EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply, it is not possible to introduce new zero rates of VAT, as we can only retain the zero rating that was in existence on 1 January 1991.  Therefore it would not be possible to apply the zero rate of VAT to condoms.  However, Member States are permitted to apply the reduced VAT rate to goods or services listed in Annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive.  In Ireland the reduced VAT rate is 13.5%.  Certain pharmaceutical products including condoms are included in Annex H.  It would therefore be possible to apply the reduced rate of VAT to condoms.  In any event, if there was a reduction in the rate of VAT applying to condoms, I am not convinced, given the mark ups in the sector, that any rate reduction would necessarily be fully reflected in retail prices for condoms.

This means that the HSE do not charge VAT on the services they provide and the HSE cannot recover VAT incurred on their input costs.Under EU law private suppliers of home care services must charge VAT at the appropriate rate of up to 21% depending on the service provided. My Department is examining in consultation with the Department of Health and Children the scope within the relevant EU Directives to exempt the provision of such services from VAT in the future.

A further 1 million treatment packs of Tamiflu, have now been stockpiled as part of our pandemic preparedness strategy.  This quantity is sufficient to treat 25% of the population and is in line with international trends. We have also stockpiled 63kg of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (oseltamivir phosphate powder). This will allow for treatment of approximately 60,000 children aged between 1 and 5 years of age.We are also stockpiling 706,000 courses of the other suitable antiviral drug, Relenza. This is sufficient to cover 20% of the population over the age of seven. This antiviral can be used in the event of resistance developing to the first line drug, Tamiflu, and will also provide cover if the clinical attack rate is higher than 25%. This stockpile will be complete by September 2007; the first 70,000 courses have been delivered.The Influenza Pandemic Expert Group is finalising advice on infection control, with reference to recommendations from the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke's Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government's decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.  A transfer on similar lines took place earlier this year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke's.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke's are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  Medical and scientific experts from the hospital are involved in developing the output specifications for the delivery of new radiation oncology services nationally.  The Chief Executive at St. Luke's will lead the management team of the new facility at St. James's.  I also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke's to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group to advise me on progress on the implementation of the plan.The tender has recently been awarded for two additional and two replacement linear accelerators at St. Luke's to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the national plan.  I expect these services to commence late next year.  I also recently announced the approval of two radiation oncology facilities at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals, comprising of two linear accelerators and associated treatment planning at each site, to be delivered in early 2009.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child-care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

Subsequently, a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Task Group was established to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.The Task Group's report was submitted to the Board of the HSE on 1st June last, and its recommendation that the new paediatric hospital be developed as an independent hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital was endorsed by the Board.  At its meeting on 8th June, the Government also strongly endorsed the recommendation.A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group has been established to advance the development of the new hospital on the Mater site.  Among the key items being addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new hospital and the determination of the scope and location of the urgent care centres required to support the new hospital.  The Transition Group will have consultations with relevant stakeholders.  The Joint Transition Group is in the process of contracting external assistance in relation to the development of a high level framework brief for the new hospital, including operational policies for the proposed urgent care centres.To date no decision has been taken in relation to the range of services to be provided at the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght in the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and the associated urgent care centres.  Services at Our Lady's Children's Hospital are to transfer to the new hospital.  St James's Hospital is an adult teaching hospital which currently treats a small number of children on an exceptional basis.  The framework brief will help to inform decisions in relation to the full range of services to be provided at the new hospital.

In addition, the network of 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) which were established under the EOCP assist the assessment process at local level.  The programme criteria include the creation of new childcare places, value for money, the capacity of the Group to deliver on its proposal and whether duplication or displacement of existing services may occur.  When a Group requests staffing grant assistance under the EOCP, a strong focus on disadvantage is also required in order for the proposal to receive such funding.The role of the CCCs has been further enhanced under the NCIP 2006-2010 to enable greater flexibility and responsiveness to local needs, supported by the provision of additional funding for the implementation of their 2006 Action Plans and the recruitment of additional staff.  This role involves, inter alia, the assessment of childcare needs across their City or County, and supporting the development of quality childcare in areas where there are service gaps.  Under both Programmes, the CCCs play a key role in assessing each proposal for displacement or duplication.  Applications considered likely to result in significant displacement or duplication are not recommended for funding.

Due consideration is given to each proposal in order to avoid duplication and displacement of other childcare services in the area, and if a significant risk of such duplication or displacement is likely to arise, the grant will not be awarded.The City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) play a key role in this process.  Under the NCIP, each proposal is submitted to the CCC, which are tasked with the development of quality childcare in their City or County.Under both the EOCP and the NCIP, capital grants are available for the purchase, extension and for refurbishment of buildings, for the purpose of increasing the supply of quality childcare.  If a grant recipient fails to meet the conditions attached to his or her contractual agreement with Pobal, a decommitment and recovery process commences where monies paid to the grant recipient are recouped.  This process is agreed by the Programme Appraisal Committee, before a decision is made regarding the decommittal of funding by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children.Contracts under the EOCP issued by Pobal to private childcare providers state, inter alia, that: The Provider agrees to operate the grant project for a minimum period until a date falling 2, 5, 7 (delete as appropriate) years from the date of last payment by Pobal of an instalment of the grant.  The periods referred to are: 2 years in the case of a grant of €19,045 or less; 5 years in the case of a grant between €19,045-€36,821 and; 7 years in the case of a grant between €36,821 and €50,790 (€50,790 being the maximum grant available under the EOCP).Each such case is examined on its merits and I cannot comment in advance on what would happen in an individual case.

As a result it is at present self sufficient in aggregates reserves. However, the enormous increase in demand for aggregates in recent years for the construction sector has placed considerable pressure on existing sources of supply and related land banks.Recent estimates suggest that 130 million tonnes of aggregates are used annually in Ireland which has one of the highest per-capita rates of consumption in Europe. No estimate exists of the scale of available aggregate resources nationally (whether of rock material or sand and gravel) and accordingly, it is not known whether sufficient resources exist to cover infrastructure and construction needs over the next 20 years and in areas where they are needed most.The Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI), a division of my Department, has carried out Aggregate Potential Mapping (APM) in Counties Donegal, Meath and Wicklow to date. This mapping is intended to delineate areas with potential resources of aggregates for the information of planning authorities to ensure that potential sources are not sterilised inadvertently by competing land uses and to indicate the distribution of potential sources. It may be desirable to expand the area of coverage of such mapping in coming years. While it will not yield a precise estimate of resources it will provide guidance to planners in making critical land use decisions.

It considered that this reform would result in a better model for the State's role in the sector, better resource management, more and better involvement of stakeholders, better corporate governance and value for money. Under Government policy the sector is to be re-organised by subsuming the existing central and regional fisheries boards into a single national inland fisheries authority (NIFA) whose executive functions will be aligned on a regional basis with the river basin districts in line with the EU Water Framework Directive. Irrespective of the overall organisational structure there will still be a need for operations to be conducted on a regional basis with local offices.Due to competing priorities for time in the Oireachtas's legislative calendar, however, it has not proved possible to introduce the legislation required to facilitate the establishment of the new authority this year. It has therefore been decided to use the additional time available to examine how the existing seventeen pieces of legislation governing the inland fisheries sector, which date back to 1959, can be modernised and consolidated into a single statute. Officials from the Department are working with management of the fisheries boards on this exercise and it is hoped to publish the new legislation in the latter half of 2007.FGS Consulting has also recently been re-engaged by the Department to undertake Stage II of the review. This process will involve full, transparent and comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders during which the principles and structures to deliver the new model will be fleshed out. The findings of Stage II will inform the drafting of the legislation required to establish the new authority.The funding referred to by the Deputy was announced in the context of the fisheries boards', or any successor agency's, enforcement and protection effort during the establishment of the new management regime for the wild salmon fishery.

The management agreement provides for shared access for local and visiting anglers, allowing the fishery to be run on a sustainable basis into the future. Residents living within the catchment area cannot, I understand, be refused membership of the local club.Discussions have commenced on this basis with the Gweebarra Fishing Club. I understand that neither the Fintown nor Rosses clubs has fishing rights within the Gweebarra catchment area.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	674	The economy and society overall require that energy supply meets the demands of Irish consumers and industry at all times. The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has broad statutory functions in relation to security of electricity supply in line with EU Directives. It is the duty of the CER to monitor the security of supply of electricity and to take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply. In particular, the CER can host a competition to acquire the necessary generation or it can direct the Transmission System Operator, ESB or any licensed undertaking to put in place any arrangements that the CER considers necessary to protect security of supply.EirGrid's statutory role, as the independent Transmission System Operator, is to deliver quality connection, transmission and market services to generators, suppliers and customers utilising the high voltage electricity system, and to put in place the grid infrastructure required to support the economy. In fulfilling this role, EirGrid is required to develop, maintain and operate a safe, secure, reliable, economical and efficient transmission system.In co-operation with EirGrid, the CER carries out extensive ongoing monitoring to identify any factors affecting security of supply at an early stage so that any necessary measures can be taken.Specifically, in discharge of its responsibilities, the TSO publishes an annual Generation Adequacy Report (GAR) which, inter alia, sets out estimates of the demand for electricity over a seven-year timeframe, the likely production capacity that will be in place to meet this demand, and assesses the consequences in terms of the overall supply-demand balance. In its most recent GAR published in December 2005 the TSO forecasts an average annual rate of growth of electricity demand up to 2012 of just under 4%.In line with international norms, the generation system in Ireland is designed, planned and monitored such that it meets a standard which requires it to meet all reasonable demands for supply. This is designed to ensure that, in designing the system, the appropriate balance is met between protecting security of supply and the cost of building and running the system.At my request, CER and EirGrid have been briefing me and my Department on a regular basis on the prognosis for winter 06/07 and generation adequacy in the medium term. The CER advises me that it is satisfied the generation system is currently adequate to meet demand, and provides a sufficient margin to meet the security standard. The CER has also advised that there is sufficient capacity and arrangements in place to provide for demand to be met in the short term.The CER is taking measures to facilitate the development of the system such that it remains adequate to maintain that security standard. Security of supply will be enhanced in the longer term with the development of additional electric interconnection and the development of the Single Electricity, and the resulting all-island approach to security of supply.With regard to existing generation capacity, the most recent advice to me from CER and EirGrid is that generation adequacy in terms of the supply-demand balance will be manageable up to 2009 provided however that projections by generation companies regarding performance and availability are met and that planned new generation capacity comes on stream to schedule. EirGrid will shortly publish its Generation Adequacy Review 2007-2013 which will set out its assessment of supply-demand over the period.The Government is also concerned to ensure that adequate provision is also made to encourage the development of an electricity portfolio, which can support and complement the ambitious targets which we have now set for renewable growth. Decisions in this regard by the CER, EirGrid and the Government will be informed by the need to ensure capacity and competition in the generation sector while reflecting the overriding consideration of security of supply.

This fund will be available to all those subject to a compulsory closure of their current commercial fishery, namely the holders of drift net licences and some draft net licence holders.The level of payments will be based on the average verifiable catch for each licence holder for the past 5 years (2001-2005). Each individual licence holder should receive 6 times his average catch multiplied by the average net income per salmon (which is estimated to be €23 per salmon). In all cases a payment equal to 6 times the current licence fee will be made to each licence holder.The hardship fund will be managed on an administrative basis by BIM and the Regional Fisheries Boards and the licence holders referred to by the Deputy will be eligible to apply on the above basis.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	677	The Deputy is aware that the Government adopted the key recommendations of the report by the Independent Group established to examine the implications of fully aligning the management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice in 2007 and beyond. The central recommendation of this report is the creation of a hardship fund for those affected by the compulsory cessation of indiscriminate mixed stock fishing at sea.The Government's primary motivation in adopting the report is that of conservation of the wild salmon species, which has long been regarded as one of Ireland's most prized fish. It is vital to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch. The current imperative must be to maintain stocks above conservation limits or at the very least halt the observed decline.In their report the group commented that the level of hardship likely to be experienced would vary both in extent and scale. Taking all factors into account and based on available information, noting particularly that there is no legal obligation on the State to provide compensation in a situation where it is imposing management measures that are fundamentally in the public good, they proposed to provide a measure of relief to each individual in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced. They recommended that this should be based on the recent catch history of the individual licence holder from 2001 to 2005.The Government accepted the recommendation of the Independent Group and has determined the level of payment should be based on the average verifiable catch and on the average net income per salmon in the commercial fishery for the past five years; that is from 2001 to 2005. This income calculation was based, on the average price obtained per fish each year less the costs incurred by fishermen. Each individual licence holder who applies to the fund is set to receive six times their average catch multiplied by the average net income per salmon. An additional payment equal to 6 times the current licence fee will be made in all cases. In the case of drift-net fishermen, this latter equals a payment of €2,022.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable allocation.An additional fund of €5 million will be available for a community support scheme. The focus of this measure should primarily be those communities, including crew members, where drift-net fishing has been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on their economic and social fabric, e.g. Gaeltacht areas. Those eligible under this scheme would include those formerly involved in the drift-netting sector, the processing sector or where a promoter proposes to employ a significant number of people formerly engaged in drift-netting.The licensing regime in the northeast of England was quite different to that which applies in this jurisdiction. I understand that property rights may have attached to fishing licences in England, which is not the case here. I am not aware of what may be offered to those fishermen that remain in the fishery, now that the Habitats Directive has a bearing on the continuation of mixed stock fisheries in all EU member states.

These bodies continually examine the totality of the scientific and medical evidence available so we have the most up to date and accurate information in regard to the potential health effects, if any, of electromagnetic fields.The Government approved the establishment of an inter-Departmental committee on the health effects of electromagnetic fields in September 2005. The committee is chaired by my Department and will provide advice to the Government on the appropriate action to be taken on foot of recommendations contained in the report "Non-Ionising Radiation from mobile phones handsets and masts", published in June 2005 by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. This committee has overseen the establishment of an expert group on the health effects of electromagnetic fields, which has undertaken a thorough review of the latest scientific reports and will report to the inter-departmental committee on the current scientific consensus and science-based policy. The inter-Departmental committee expects to report to Government in the near future.

Under the 1952 Act, the Board of BIM is appointed by the Minister of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and is required to prepare financial statements and to ensure regularity of transactions. BIM receives a budget from the Department each year in accordance with agreed strategies and objectives and is required to produce an Annual Report, which is audited by the C&AG and laid before the Oireachtas.BIM assists the various CLAMS groups around the country from time to time with very modest sums of money, although there is no fixed budget allocation in their Vote devoted exclusively for this purpose. It should be noted that all of the actions of the CLAMS groups that receive state monies are co-funded by the members themselves, either by contributions in kind or by actual cash contributions. In this context, some of the groups are exploring ways of becoming financially self sufficient through collectively growing aquaculture products, on a cooperative basis, and I am encouraging this approach as it engenders financial sustainability and a spirit of acting in the common good.With regard to the Killary CLAMS group, BIM is making a financial contribution towards the employment of an expert independent chairman and I would urge all of the growers there to engage with the chairman and participate actively in the group so as to have their point of view made known.Membership of the group is open at all times to anybody holding an aquaculture licence. The CLAMS process is the state's mechanism for dealing with issues at a local level.

I continue to raise our concerns in all of my dealings with key figures in the US Administration and Legislature, including during a wide ranging discussion which I had with the new US Ambassador on 1st November.In the period since the mid-term Congressional elections, I have written to a number of senior US legislators to congratulate them on the outcome of the elections. In doing so, I have taken the opportunity to emphasise again the Government's deep interest in the issue of the undocumented. Our Ambassador in Washington is also active in highlighting our concerns in his on-going contacts with the incoming Congressional leadership, as are officials of our Consulates across the United States.I travelled to New York after the elections and discussed the prospects for immigration reform with a range of contacts there. I was happy to meet again with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR). ILIR is proving highly effective on Capitol Hill and beyond in communicating the Irish dimension to the undocumented issue and I have been happy to support it financially. This was the third in a series of meetings that I have had with ILIR since September and it provided a valuable opportunity to review the situation following the mid-term elections. I will be keeping in close contact with them in the period ahead.I now look forward to a further intensification of the Government's efforts on behalf of the undocumented in the period ahead, in particular with key Members of the incoming Congress. Overall, my initial assessment is that the recent elections have given a boost to the prospects for reform, though the issue of comprehensive immigration reform remains difficult and divisive both in Congress and in the United States generally.I should emphasise also that I very much welcome the continuing commitment of Senators Kennedy and McCain to the advancement of the comprehensive approach to immigration that they have long promoted and which the Government strongly supports. I also greatly appreciate the recent reiteration by President Bush of his on-going commitment to comprehensive reform in this area.The Government's overriding objective continues to be to ensure that our undocumented citizens in the United States can regularise their status, travel freely to and from Ireland and ultimately secure a path to permanent residency. Despite all the difficulties and challenges, I look forward to further progress on this priority issue for the Government in the coming period.

Rebate amounting to approximately €1.3 million was paid to the company out of the Social Insurance Fund on foot of these claims.During 2002, the Labour Court issued a recommendation and clarification aimed at resolving the dispute over ex-gratia redundancy terms at the company. In situations where the Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal in trade disputes, its recommendations are not enforceable in law.  In such cases, the Court hears both sides and then issues a recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled.  I understand that in November 2002, the workers at the company voted on and accepted a revised package on severance pay which it was intended would be binding on both the company and the workers.

The project is funded by FÁS as a sponsor organisation under the FÁS Supported Employment Programme for people with disabilities, and is based in Ballymun, Dublin.  The FÁS Supported Employment Programme is an open labour market initiative that provides supports to disabled people, who traditionally have had difficulty getting into paid employment.The service provided by the project is to assist ‘job ready' clients integrate back into the workplace. To qualify for the Supported Employment Programme, clients must be ready to take up work in the open labour market. This, therefore, would not necessitate job coaches making home visits and it has never been the practice to do so.  Clients meet with job coaches in the Ballymun Centre, and from time-to-time in alternative locations around the city.  There has been no change in policy in this regard.As this is a sponsor organization contracted by FÁS under the Supported Employment Programme to provide services to people with disabilities, FÁS would like to be informed of any difficulties with regard to the accessibility of its offices to clients for this service.

As no agreement was reached between ICTU and IBEC, ICTU has referred the matter to the Labour Court asking that the Court examine the national minimum wage and make a recommendation on the matter.  The recommendation from the Labour Court is currently awaited.Sub-minimum rates of the National Minimum Wage apply where an employee is:Under age 18; orIn the first two years after the date of first employment over age 18; orUndergoing a prescribed course of study or training.In accordance with Section 14(b) of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, employees under the age of 18 are entitled to 70% of the national minimum wage.  This percentage was recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission to strike a balance between ensuring that young employees are not exploited and ensuring that the rate of pay does not encourage students to leave full-time education.

As regards the assets of the poultry company that closed recently, Enterprise Ireland will work with Shannon Development to assist the purchasers of the assets of the company to develop their businesses.  So far, none of the assets have been sold, although it is expected that some sales will occur in the near future.Shannon Development has had ongoing contact with the group in question in relation to a number of issues in particular, the recent job losses.  Indeed, a meeting between the two regarding these and other pertinent issues was held on 1 November.  I understand that both parties were pleased with the meeting and that the outcome was satisfactory from the point of view of all concerned.Both the Government and the Industrial Development agencies recognise the need to create high volume employment opportunities in Co Limerick that will provide sustainable jobs.  The most recent example of the attraction of Limerick as a location for new business was the decision by Northern Trust Corporation to create 300 high quality jobs in the financial services sector.  Another example is Vistakon, which recently announced its intention to expand its Limerick operation and create some 120 jobs in high-end manufacturing.There is general buoyancy in overall employment in Co. Limerick as evidenced by the most recent Live Register figures released by the Central Statistics Office.  These show that for October, 2006, the Live Register figure for the County is 6,888 which is more than 4% down on the previous month's figure of 7,205.

Support and assistance for small businesses in Ireland, both financial and non-financial, is delivered by a number of State bodies.  These State bodies are the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and FÁS, all of whom receive their funding from this Department and all of whom have an expertise in the area of business start-ups.The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provide support to micro-enterprises with 10 employees or fewer.  The function of the CEBs is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants or for non-financial support such as business advice and information, management development, training and mentoring.All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of new and existing enterprises by individuals, firms and community groups provided that the projects, that should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.In order to qualify for Enterprise Ireland assistance client companies must be Irish owned, be a manufacturing or an internationally trading services enterprise or be an overseas company in the food, drink and timber sectors seeking assistance to locate in Ireland, must employ more than 10 people or be a high growth start-up according to criteria defined by the Board of Enterprise Ireland.  In addition Enterprise Ireland must be satisfied that the company will;produce products for sale primarily in world marketsproduce products of an advanced technological nature for supply to internationally trading or skilled sub-supply firms within the Stateproduce products for sectors of the Irish market which are subject to international competition or is a service industry, as defined by relevant ministerial order.The most appropriate course of action, therefore, would be for the project promoter to directly contact the CEB network to discuss the potential to further develop the initiative into a formal business proposition (www.enterpriseboards.ie).  Depending on the potential size and investment package of the initiative the CEBs may advise the promoter that Enterprise Ireland (www.enterprise-ireland.com), which assists in the development of small to medium enterprises, may be better placed to assist the promoter.In addition, the project promoter should also access the website (www.basis.ie) which provides general information on starting and developing a new business in Ireland.  The aim of the BASIS (Business Access to State Information and Services) website is to provide information on all Irish Government services to business.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	695	I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 328 together.Since 1 January 2005 there have been 12 site visits to Carlow, seven in 2005 and five in 2006 to date. There were no site visits to County Wicklow in 2005 and 2006.Ultimately it is the investor who decides where to locate, including where to visit as a potential location.  What they are indicating to IDA is that they are seeking an urban base, close to third level educational facilities, that provides infrastructure and services that are international in focus.At the end of 2005 there were 12 IDA supported companies located in Wicklow, employing 2,444 people and 9 companies were located in Carlow, employing 717 people.  IDA Ireland's strategy for both Wicklow and Carlow is to promote these locations as part of the overall East Region, where there is a readily available pool of skilled workers, a critical mass in population, a world-class access infrastructure in terms of roads, airport and telecoms, an excellent quality of life and easy access to third level education and research capabilities.  In this regard the contributions of the Institute of Technology Carlow, and St. Patrick's College, are critical to ensuring that the region develop first class educational and research capabilities to support existing and new investment.The Agency advise that there continues to be a good level of expansion activity from its existing industry base in Wicklow, especially in the pharmaceutical and medical technological sectors. The County's proximity to Dublin, together with the rail and road links combine to enhance its attractiveness in attracting overseas mobile investment and the level of new jobs created year on year is a testament to this. In October 2006 Servier Pharmaceuticals announced a 112 job expansion involving an investment of €69m to increase production of existing products and add 2 new products.I am confident that the strategies being pursued by IDA Ireland is the best strategy in terms of delivering new greenfield or expansion projects for the people of Carlow and Wicklow.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	696	The attached tabular statement sets out the numbers of job gains and job losses in respect of full-time employment in companies assisted by the enterprise development agencies (Enterprise Ireland and IDA) in Counties Wicklow and Carlow for the years 2001 to 2005.It is important to remember that job creation and job losses are a feature of economic development in all countries as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change.  The importance of gainful employment for society, however, means that efforts to create employment opportunities to replace those lost over time are an important objective of enterprise policy. Where job losses occur, the development agencies — Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, the County Enterprise Boards and FÁS — have adopted a coordinated approach in order to enhance and facilitate the future employment prospects of the workforce and to identify and support any individual who wishes to start their own business. In addition the enterprise agencies work closely with key local partners including Local Authorities, Chambers of Commerce, educational institutions etc to develop the local infrastructure and skills base to best effect.The enterprise development agencies are committed to promoting Wicklow and Carlow as locations for investment, as well as supporting and developing businesses already present in these county.  IDA Ireland continues to work with its existing base of companies with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and the agency also targets potential new investment projects in the International Services Sector and high value manufacturing activities. The proximity of both counties to Dublin together with a readily available pool of skilled workers and excellent quality of life combines to enhance their attractiveness in encouraging overseas mobile investment and the level of new jobs created year on year is a testament to this. Carlow's two third level colleges, the Institute of Technology Carlow and St. Patrick's College are critical to ensuring that Carlow and the region develop educational and research capabilities to support existing and new investment.The continued commitment by IDA Ireland to Carlow is evidenced by the development of a Flagship Business and Technology Park on the Dublin road, an investment of almost €11.5m to date. A 17,600 sq ft Advance Office Building on the Technology Park with 100% expansion capability was completed in November 2005.  IDA is actively marketing the building and park through our network of overseas offices.There continues to be a good level of expansion activity from the existing industry base in Wicklow especially in the Pharmaceutical and Medical Technological sectors. In October 2006 Servier Pharmaceuticals announced 112 job (over 5 years) expansion with €69m investment to increase production of existing products and additional 2 new products. The County's key locations for promotion to potential overseas investors at present are IDA Arklow Business Park (c.80 acres)  Greystones Business & Technology Park (75 acres) and IDA Bray Business Park (50 acres).Enterprise Ireland activity, in terms of job creation, is focused on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies, the creation of new jobs by supporting entrepreneurs to set up High Potential Start-Up Companies and also through enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level by supporting research in companies and third level institutions.20012002200320042005Totals

In May of that year, the company confirmed that workers at the company had accepted its redundancy offer by a large majority.  Unfortunately, matters continued to decline into 2006 resulting in the company going into voluntary liquidation at the end of September with the loss of the remaining 260 jobs.  Since it was liquidated by its parent company, the O'Kane Group of Northern Ireland, the workers received statutory redundancy only.  The union has sought an enhanced package along the lines of three weeks pay per year of service, plus statutory.I understand the Labour Relations Commission has agreed to facilitate talks between the O'Kane Group, the trade union and employee representatives regarding the claim for an enhanced redundancy package for the former employees of Castlemahon Foods and a meeting to this effect was held yesterday.  The LRC will continue to remain in contact with the parties on the matter.

While each is liable for social insurance contributions at a rate of 3 per cent, the basis for the assessment differs.  For the self-employed on self-assessment, there is provision for the deduction of capital allowances, a provision which is not available to Class S contributors on the PAYE system.  As such, the question of discrimination against the self-employed in the provision of benefits does not arise.In all, I consider that the arrangements outlined above are not discriminatory and that they represent a reasonable response to the social security requirements of self-employed workers generally.

The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation.Rent supplement is not normally paid where the rent is in excess of the limits because the personal contribution to rent made by the tenant should not be such that their post rent income is less than the relevant SWA rate minus the minimum contribution to rent prescribed in legislation and, as a consequence, insufficient to meet their other daily needs after paying their rent.Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example:where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances for example, disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons.where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short periodwhere the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard AND has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme, it specifically protects against homelessness and it ensures that people have an adequate post-rent income.In November 2002, when the Central Statistics Office Privately Owned Rent Index first showed evidence of continued reductions in rent levels, regulations were introduced to set the maximum amount of rent in respect of which a rent supplement is payable.  These limits remained in place to the end of December 2003.  Further Regulations introduced in December 2003 and prescribed the limits to be used between January 2004 and June 2005.  The current rent limits cover the period July 2005 to 31st December 2006.Despite recent increases in rent levels the Central Statistics Office Privately Owned Rent Index shows that rent levels for October 2006 were in line with those which applied in October 2002.My Department is currently reviewing rent limits in order to develop proposals regarding what limits should apply from January 2007 onwards.  The review is taking account of prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, together with detailed input from the Health Service Executive on the market situation within each of its operational areas.The review will also include consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  In addition, a number of the voluntary agencies working in this area have made detailed submissions.  This process will ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.

The limit, which applied only to new claims after August 1992, was set at €12, 697.38 a year (gross earnings).  Where earnings are in excess of €12,697.38 a year, there may be entitlement to a reduced rate of payment of deserted wife's benefit, provided gross earnings do not exceed €17,776.33 a year.Following the introduction of the one parent family payment in 1997, the deserted wives benefit scheme was discontinued with effect from January that year.  Existing entitlements already acquired in August 1992, when the earnings limit was introduced for new claimants, and in 1997, when the one parent family payment scheme was introduced, have been preserved.  The upper income ceiling applying to deserted wife's benefit of €17,776.33 (gross) in 1997 has not changed since then.With over 80,000 parents with caring responsibilities receiving support under the one parent family payment, I was glad to be able to increase the earnings ceiling for the one parent family payment in this year's budget from €293 to €375 per week or €19,500 a year (gross earnings).  Recipients of deserted wife's benefit with dependent children may transfer to the one parent family payment if it is beneficial for them to do so.In March of this year, I launched a major Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents" which addresses the difficulties faced by low income families and their children.The report puts forward radical proposals for reform of the income support system for all parents on a low income.  The report proposes the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of child care, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new Parental Allowance for low income families with young children.A range of views has been expressed as this report is debated and I will give very serious consideration to all of them.  Once I am convinced that we have reached conclusions that are equitable, with a fully workable implementation strategy, it is my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation.  Any further changes to the deserted wife's benefit scheme will be examined in an overall budgetary context.

Under the terms of supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a recipient of a social welfare or Health Services Executive payment who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income can apply to the local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement.  In addition, legislation also provides for a single payment — known as an exceptional needs payment — to be made to help meet essential, once-off exceptional expenditure.Provision for the payment of exceptional needs payments and special heating supplements is made in the primary legislation and regulations governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The legislative provisions allow the community welfare service to pay a heating supplement or an exceptional needs payment where they determine that such a payment is warranted on the basis of all the circumstances in a particular case.  The community welfare service in all areas of the country deals with exceptional needs payments and heating supplements on a regular basis.  Guidelines on these schemes are available on the Department's website.  The guidelines for exceptional needs payments and heating supplements were last updated in June 2006.

Specific measures include improving the lowest rates of income support by increasing the lowest rates to €150 a week in 2002 terms by 2007 (in line with the commitment in the National Anti Poverty Strategy).  The plan also provides for examining the incentive effects of  disability payment levels, addressing benefit traps and employment disincentives within the structure of welfare disability schemes and examining the potential for extending, improving and rationalising schemes to better support people in their efforts to take up training opportunities and participate in employment.Implementation of the sectoral plan is underway in my Department and I do not envisage delays in its implementation.  Recent initiatives include, improvements in the earnings disregard, from June 2006, for people receiving Disability Allowance or Blind Pension and the abolition, in September 2006, of  peak hour restrictions on the use of the Free Travel Pass.  The result is that people with disabilities may now use their passes going to work or attending educational, rehabilitative and therapeutic courses that are, very often, central to improving their lifestyles.  There have been significant improvements to Carers Allowance so that, for example, a couple can earn up to €580 a week and receive the maximum rate of carers allowance as well as free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant.The Citizens Information Bill, 2006, which provides for the introduction of a Personal Advocacy Service for people with disabilities — a key priority in my Department's sectoral plan — is before Dail Eireann at present.  Budget 2006 provided over €2 million to Comhairle for the development of advocacy services by the community and voluntary sector for people with disabilities and by the end of this year some 30 advocacy projects will be in place throughout the country.  Earlier this month, I launched a report which sets out proposals for a new Sign Language Interpretation Service for some 5,000 people with hearing impairment to be rolled out by Comhairle in two phases commencing in 2007.Work is on schedule in my Department in relation to other commitments in the plan including disability awareness training for front line staff and a comprehensive set of actions to ensure full accessibility for people with disabilities to the offices and the services provided by my Department.  The implementation of the sectoral plan is a key priority in my Department's business and strategic planning processes over the next three years.  Our objective is to ensure that people with disabilities receive high quality services that best support, recognise and encourage them in using and making a full contribution to society, in line with the Government's National Disability Strategy.

The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Widows and widowers aged 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.People aged over 70 years of age can qualify for the household benefits package regardless of their income or household composition.  Those aged under 70 must live alone or with certain excepted people in order to qualify.  Excepted people for the purposes of the scheme include qualified adults, dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full time education, people who are so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months; people who would qualify for the allowance in their own right, people who are providing constant care and attention to any member of the household who is so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months.  A range of proposals have been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package of schemes.  These proposals are kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme, the achieving of maximum supports for those most in need of the entitlements, and budgetary resources.

Fuel allowance, which is paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  Some 274,000 people (151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement) will benefit in 2006 at an estimated annual cost €125.1m.A number of improvements have been made to the scheme in recent years including the easing of the means test and extending the duration of payment from 26 weeks to 29 weeks.  Most recently, Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of €5.00 from €9.00 to €14.00 (€17.90 in designated smokeless areas).I have also made provision for increases in the value of the household benefits package.  I increased the value of the natural gas allowance to cover increased standing charges and the associated VAT as well as additional kilowatt hour usage in order to cover the 33.8 % increase in the cost of natural gas from October 1st.  This means that the value of the natural gas allowance to a household has increased from €313.17 to €516.00 per year.At present, the electricity allowance covers normal standing charges and up to 1,800 units of electricity.  The allowance also covers the VAT applicable to these charges.  In the light of the recent increase in electricity charges, the allowance will be increased to cover increased standing charges and the units will also increase from 1,800 to 2,400 with effect from January 2007.  I am confident that these increases will be of major benefit to these recipients.  Any further changes to the fuel allowance scheme or the household benefits package would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.

Over that period weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer's allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  This means test has been eased significantly over the years.  Following Budget 2006, since April, the earnings disregard for a couple has been set at €580 per week which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings.  This means that a couple with two children can earn up to €32,925 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant.In accordance with the social partnership agreement, "Towards 2016 ", I am committed to expanding, subject to available resources, the income limits for carer's allowance and aiming to keep the level of the disregard in line with average industrial earnings.  It is estimated that, at current rates of payment, increasing the earnings disregard for a couple to €700 per week would cost in the region of €10 million for a full year.

I understand from Iarnród Éireann that the balance will enter service during December 2006 and that it intends to introduce hourly clock face departures on the route from 14 January 2007.  I also understand that the testing and commissioning of the new fleet has gone well and that, apart from a problem that is being addressed in relation to ride quality, no other fleet wide issues or technical failures have occurred.  I understand from Iarnród Éireann that, as part of its commissioning and in service testing of the new fleet, it discovered that the ride quality did not meet the specification due to problems with the air suspension.  I am informed that this is currently being rectified by the suppliers at their expense and that it is not preventing the operation of the carriages.  I understand that the final contract price will not exceed the overall approved cost for the 67 carriages of €117m.

I am advised by the Company that in December 2005 the frequency of the service between Sligo and Dublin was increased from 3 to 5 trains per day in each direction.  New commuter railcars were used as a temporary measure to facilitate this service frequency improvement.  I understand that the extra services have been very successful in attracting additional business to rail and during 2006 the volume of passengers using the Sligo line from counties Sligo, Leitrim and Longford has increased by over 15%.The issue of overcrowding is one of discomfort and inconvenience, rather than a safety concern and this view is in line with the consensus in the railway industry worldwide.  In 2007 Iarnród Eireann will replace the commuter railcars on Sligo services with new Intercity railcars which will be very well equipped for journeys of this distance including high seating capacity, good luggage facilities and facilities for the operation of catering trolleys.

As only a limited number of DART cars are under refurbishment at any one time I am informed that the impact on service levels is limited and that Iarnród Éireann will shortly be extending the number of 8 car trains in service at peak time.  Issues arising under the contract relating to the refurbishment are commercial matters for Iarnród Éireann in the first instance and the Company is well aware of the need to ensure full value for money in all its contracts.

The ongoing monitoring costs that usually arise with such alarms are charged by the private commercial suppliers engaged by the community groups.  I understand these costs are of the order of €80 per annum per individual and, given that the Scheme has benefited as many as 100,000 older people, the cost to my Department of providing funding for all such monitoring costs would be considerable.It is my view that the available resources are better spent on continuing to improve the security of older people in their homes rather than paying for ongoing running costs and, accordingly, I have no plans at present to introduce a subsidy in regard to the monitoring costs for socially-monitored alarm systems.

I have decided to increase the maximum payment to participants in the 1994–99 Scheme from €12,075 to €14,075 and the maximum payment in the current Scheme from €13,515 to €15,000.  These increases will cost some €33 million extra over the remaining period of the two Schemes, and some 5,000 retired farmers will benefit from them.These increases will be payable to participants in both Schemes with effect from 1 November 2006.  Therefore, retired farmers whose participation in the 1994 Scheme had finished on or before 31 October 2006 will not benefit from the increased payment.

The case of the person named was reviewed under this measure and his entitlements were re-calculated to take full account of destocked sheep.  A supplementary payment issued to the person named on 19th October 2006.A special category was included under the provisions of the 2005 National Reserve to cater for sheep farmers with commonage land who were prevented from expanding their sheep production prior to or during the 2000-2002 reference period pending publication of the Commonage Framework Plans in 2002.  The farmers concerned must have had a stocking density of less than 0.45 livestock units per hectare in 2001 and their existing Single Payment must have been less than €6,000.  Individual farmers were free to make an application under this measure but application forms were not automatically sent to farmers.  No application from the person named was received under this measure.  However, the person named is not eligible for qualification under the National Reserve category for Hill Farmers as his existing Single Payment is greater than €6,000.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	742	I propose to take Questions Nos. 378 and 383 together.The compensation package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime is worth over €310m to Ireland. It comprises three elements.  The first element is the sugar beet compensation being incorporated into the Single Payment Scheme with effect from 2006. It will be worth approximately €123 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.The second element is the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry, which in Ireland's case is worth €145m approximately. This aid, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No. 320/2006, is to cover the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring the sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota.  It is to be drawn down on the basis of an aid application, including a detailed restructuring plan, submitted by the processor.  In July 2006 the Government made decisions regarding the percentage of the aid to be reserved for beet growers and contractors and the indicative breakdown of the potential allocation of the aid to be followed by Greencore in preparing its restructuring plan, including an amount for employee redundancy payments.  These decisions are now the subject of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court. Under the EU Regulation, the first instalment of aid would fall to be paid in June 2007.The third element of the compensation package is the diversification aid, also provided for in Council Regulation (EC) 320/2006, worth almost €44m in Ireland's case.  A national restructuring programme is being prepared, in accordance with the EU Regulations, for submission to the EU Commission by the end of this year with a view to drawing down the diversification aid. The Regulations provide that payment of the aid would commence in September 2007.

The Deputy will be aware that, as a result of my approach to the EU Commissioner earlier this year, agreement was reached to allow these advance payments.The work involved in topping-up the Single Payment Entitlements of those former sugar beet farmers who are due to have their Single Payment increased as a result of the additional compensation due under the Reform of the Sugar Regime is completed in the case of the majority of farmers.  The balancing payment incorporating the sugar beet compensation will be paid to all of these farmers, whose applications are fully processed, on 1 December 2006.Work on the inclusion of the sugar beet compensation in the Single Payment in respect of the remainder of the cases is ongoing, but it is significantly advanced at this stage.  This work is quite complex, involving as it does, for example, transfers between family members, mergers and scissions.  In the meantime, I have arranged to pay the balancing payment, without the sugar beet compensation, on 1 December, to all of these farmers whose applications are otherwise fully processed.I expect that the additional payments arising from the inclusion of the sugar beet compensation will commence issuing to these farmers in the early days of December 2006 as their applications are processed.Generally speaking, in common with the schemes, which the Single Payment Scheme replaced, delays in processing can be caused by many factors, including incomplete application forms, errors on applications and discrepancies highlighted following computer validation, which must be resolved via correspondence with the applicant.  The majority of those cases, without a sugar beet element, which have yet to receive an advance payment, are where applicants did not submit an application to transfer the Single Payment entitlements, with lands, by way of inheritance, gift, lease or purchase.  As always, my Department will continue to issue payments to farmers, as outstanding problems are resolved.

There is no legal obligation on the bodies to provide this information to my Department.  While there are no statistics held in my Department on the number of horses that remain to be registered our current best estimate is in the region of 12,000 out of a total national herd of about 124,000.The principal reason for the adoption of the regulations on identification of horses was to ensure proper recording of the administration of veterinary medicines and to avoid the introduction of such medicines to the human food chain. A Code of Practice on the procedures to be adopted by Veterinary Surgeons administering veterinary medicines to horses was agreed between my Department and Veterinary Ireland in February 2005. Furthermore, under EU legislation, all horses presented for slaughter at meat plants in the Community for entry into the human food chain must be accompanied by the requisite identity documentation and this is subject to check by the Veterinary Services. There have been no prosecutions under SI 399/2004 since it was adopted.

Payment will issue within the agreed period.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	748	Most of the schemes operated by my Department are demand-led measures on which expenditure in any one year is difficult to predict.  It is very important that adequate provision is made for such schemes in the annual Estimates. For 2006, the gross provision for the Department was €1.516b, and it is estimated that approximately 94% of this allocation will be spent.  While it is not possible to predict the final outturn with precision at this point, savings in the region of  €90 million could arise.Of the total projected savings, over €80 million relates to demand-led schemes.  These include measures under the CAP Rural Development Programme (REPS, land mobility and forestry), as well as on-farm investment schemes. The balance is likely to arise primarily in the animal health, research and administrative budget areas.All of the schemes are subject to variables such as farmer demand, animal disease trends, the pace of progress on approved projects and market conditions.   Demand for such schemes is never easy to predict with precision, and in recent years has been impacted by the introduction of the decoupled Single Farm Payment, the Nitrates Directive, and the relative proximity of a new Rural Development Programme.  In the case of forestry, issues such as the price of land, and competing alternative uses, were also a factor. Reducing levels of animal disease, and staff savings arising from improved technology and the centralised administration of the Single Farm Payment, are also likely to lead to savings in the relevant Subheads.I regard it as essential that the measures referred to above, which protect the animal health status of this country, provide vital investment capital and boost income for the farming community, and others in the agri-food sector, are adequately funded. My policy has been to ensure sufficient funding for potential demand under these very important measures, and I will continue to do so in the future.

Despite written warnings in previous years, the grazing continued and so premium payments were suspended.My officials now report that the situation has improved in the interim and, as the farmer has undertaken to protect the plantation in future, I am satisfied that payments can resume.  An annual premium claim form has been sent to the applicant for completion and return.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	750	Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 designates certain bovine tissues as specified risk material (SRM) and lays down rules for its removal as a public health protection measure in the context of BSE controls.In its opinion of 28 April 2005 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that a scientific basis existed to review the age limit for the removal of certain SRM in bovine animals, in particular as regards the vertebral column. In July 2005 the EU Commission adopted a reflection paper, the TSE Roadmap, looking at the next steps that could be taken with regard to BSE in the short, medium and long term.  After consultation with the Member States and stakeholders, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1974/2005 was adopted in December 2005.  This Regulation provided that the age limit for removing vertebral column, including dorsal root ganglia of bovine animals as SRM could be increased from 12 to 24 months. Provision is also made for further review of the age limit, which would have to be on the basis of scientific advice.The requirement for authorisation of retail establishments such as butchers for the specific activity of handling and removing SRM is prescribed in European and national regulations. The Environmental Health Officers Service of the Health Service Executive, under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) implements these regulations in retail butchers shops. Butchers are required either to declare non-handling of SRM or to comply with the standards for authorisation for handling of SRM. Authorisation ensures that this material is removed and disposed of in a manner which protects consumers. Butchers seeking authorisation need to demonstrate the presence of systems to ensure adequate identification, separation, removal, storage and disposal of SRM.Retail butchers who choose not to handle SRM can handle all beef from animals under 24 months. In addition unauthorised retail butchers can handle beef from animals over 24 months if it has been boned out or has its vertebral column removed prior to intake. The handling of SRM at retail level has been identified as a priority area for protection of consumers. The FSAI has consulted with the trade on the approach to implementing these regulations, and has published an extensive set of Frequently Asked Questions on its website, www.fsai.ie, to assist the trade in understanding these requirements.The requirement that all bovine animals over 30 months of age, slaughtered for human consumption, must be tested for BSE is also provided for in Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001. Under the Regulation, as it currently stands, I have no discretion to raise the age limit at which bovines destined for human consumption must be tested.Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 is currently in the process of being revised, though it is not now anticipated that the proposed amendments will become law before 2007.  The amendments, as currently drafted, would enable Member States to seek the approval of the Commission and other Member States for revisions to their annual monitoring programmes to change the age limit for testing for BSE in healthy animals slaughtered for human consumption. Such applications would be on the basis of a range of criteria relating to the BSE situation and controls in the particular country. These criteria have yet to be determined and may yet take some time to finalise.I, and my officials, have made repeated and consistent efforts to have the age thresholds for the various categories of animals changed, based on the results of surveillance carried out here and I will, of course, continue to press for a change in the age threshold at every opportunity.

I recently announced substantial increases in the maximum pension rates payable under both Schemes to take effect from 1 November 2006.  I have decided to increase the maximum pension rate payable under the 1994–99 Scheme from €12,075 to €14,075 and the maximum pension rate payable under the current Scheme from €13,515 to €15,000.  These increases will cost some €33 million extra over the remaining period of the two Schemes, and over 5,000 retired farmers will benefit from them.The announcement of these increases follows an announcement in September of an increase in the off-farm income limit for transferees under the current Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming from €25,400 to €40,000 and the removal of the total income limit for retiring farmers. Heretofore, an income limit exemption for retiring farmers existed only in cases where the farm was transferred definitively to a family member. These changes were effective from 1 September, 2006.The current Scheme closes to new applications on 31 December 2006. Proposals for a new Scheme, with a maximum payment rate of €15,000, have been included in the draft Rural Development Plan for the period 2007-2013 which was recently published for consultation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	754	One of the key features of the agriculture chapter of Towards 2016 has been the Government's willingness to provide a major increase in funding for agriculture from Exchequer resources.  This has not only made up for the inevitable decline in EU funding due to our economic success as a country, but has also provided the finance for the very significant enhancement of some major schemes which support the development of the sector.National Exchequer funding for the farm schemes under the Rural Development Programme will be €4.7 billion for the period 2007 to 2013.  This is an increase of 135% from the €2 billion in exchequer funds provided for the same schemes in the current round 2000-2006. The total funding for the agricultural measures is €6.8bn, including €2.1bn from EU and modulation.The new draft rural development programme reflects the commitments contained in the partnership agreement and will cover both agricultural and non-agricultural measures. In line with the EU rural development framework, the measures in the programme will address competitiveness and sustainability. The main elements are as follows:A 17% increase in payments under the Rural Environmental Scheme (REPS).An 8% increase in Disadvantaged Areas Scheme payments.The average forestry premium will rise by 15%.The Installation Aid rate will increase by 56%, bringing it up to €15,000.A new Early Retirement Scheme will be put in place with a maximum payment rate of €15,000.A total of €250m is allocated for an Animal Welfare, Recording and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Herds.There is capital investment funding of €100 million to support the dairy processing sector, and a €50m package for the beef and sheepmeat processing sector has also been announced.These are just a few of the measures contained in the agriculture chapter of the partnership agreement, which is a very comprehensive document.  It includes actions on all the main farming sectors, as well as on the development of the food industry.  It also includes important measures on animal health, including a 50% reduction in disease levies, and includes commitments to continuing high levels of service to farmers by the Department.  The strong focus on the future in the document is further underlined in the sections on "renewable energy", "enhancing the environment" and "measures to encourage structural change".

It has also asked that the EU arrange a joint inspection of premises to be approved for export, before 1 January 2007. Otherwise it has threatened to suspend trade in animal products between Russia and the EU.EU veterinary officials will travel to Moscow this week to explain the transitional veterinary and food safety measures that will be applied in Romania and Bulgaria from 1 January 2007.

In relation to Limited Felling Licences, Section 41 of the Forestry Act 1946 provides that the Minster may, under certain conditions, release the licensee from the obligation to comply with all or any of the replanting conditions imposed or alternatively reduce the number of trees to be planted by the licensee. Where a General Felling Licence is in operation, which is the normal type of licence used for commercial harvesting, there is still provision to exclude areas from the replanting obligation on environmental grounds, following the detailed consultation process that all felling licence applications go through.  The procedure here is to make such areas subject to a Limited Felling Licence instead and the Minister can then release the licensee from any associated replanting obligation.Any decision to waive the replanting obligation contained in a Limited Felling Licence for environmental reasons is considered on a case by case basis following detailed examination and assessment by my Department's Forest Inspectorate, and in consultation with the environmental bodies such as National Parks and Wildlife Service, Fisheries Boards and local authorities.

So far, my Department has successfully prosecuted one operator for an offence for labelling product in contravention of these Regulations.My Department is committed to ensuring that consumers can have full confidence in the organic food they buy.  For that reason, extra resources have been assigned to the Organic Unit earlier this year.  My officials are now systematically inspecting retail outlets, including supermarkets, shops and farmers' markets, checking to ensure that all product identified as organic has been produced fully in accordance with the organic regulations.Consumers can play an important part in identifying traders and retailers who may be trying to abuse the Regulations governing the organic sector.

The person named was deemed unsuccessful under this category as she did not receive the land free of charge or for a nominal sum.Category D caters for farmers who inherited or purchased land and who commenced farming after 31 December, 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  The person named was also deemed unsuccessful under this category as the land acquired was leased land which does not qualify for this category.A formal letter outlining my Department's decision on the National Reserve has issued to the person named.  The person named submitted an appeal against this decision and provided additional documentation in support of her appeal.  In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	767	The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education.  This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most.  This is part of my overall plan to introduce service improvements in the administration of the student grant schemes. These will include guaranteed timeframes for the earlier payment of grants, an independent appeals procedure and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments.To effect these administrative and service improvements requires the introduction of a new statutory basis for the scheme to replace the existing arrangements which involve a mix of statutory and non-statutory administrative schemes.  Accordingly, the Government has approved the drafting of a new Student Support Bill which will place all student support schemes on a statutory footing for the first time, including providing for the designation of an appropriate awarding authority and for the general basis on which grants will be awarded to eligible students.Work on the Bill is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill in early 2007.My Department has, as I have indicated previously, engaged in substantial consultations with the key stakeholders, including students in order to map the most logical and effective arrangements for the future structure and administration of the student support schemes.  This process of consultation is on-going. Implementation of the Bill when enacted, will take place in consultation with the relevant stakeholders to ensure an orderly transition and minimise disruption to students.

Currently, the NEPS service is now available to approximately 1,604 primary schools (representing approximately 60% of pupils) and approximately 586 post-primary schools (representing 78% of students).  This number includes 46 schools in the City and County of Dublin Vocational Schemes, which have their own psychological service.In common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.The introduction of the General Allocation Model for primary schools last year, supported by the provision of over 600 extra resource teachers, means that children with high incidence special needs now longer have to wait for an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support.Since the establishment of NEPS, the number of psychologists in the service has increased from 43 to 127 at present (including 4 psychologists currently seconded to the National Behavioural Support Service).  In the last recruitment round, regional panels were used to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need.In addition to the 127 psychologists currently in NEPS, a further 6 are in the process of being recruited.  On top of this, the 17% increase in funding for the service provided in the 2007 Estimates, will allow some further expansion in the number of psychologists next year and consequently the coverage of schools by NEP psychologists.  The actual number of extra staff will be determined shortly.

The reference date for the provision by schools of this information is the 30th September of the school year in question and the date for return by the schools is 31 October.  Consequently, the details for the current school year (2006/2007) are not yet available.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are now no less than 4,000 extra primary teachers, compared with 2002.  Furthermore, there are nearly 7,000 more primary teachers than there were in 1997.  The average class size in our primary schools is now 24.  With the unprecedented increases in support staff, there is now one teacher for every 17 primary school children, down from one for 22.  Children who need extra help are getting more support than ever before.  I am sure the Deputy will be happy to hear that the number of children in large classes nationally has been significantly reduced.  When the Government first came into office, there were more than 52,000 children in classes of 35 and over — five times the number that there were in the last school year.  There were also more than 1,900 children in classes of 40 and over — compared to just over 200 in 05/06.  While I appreciate the need to make further progress in reducing class size, it should be acknowledged just how much has been achieved.In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those that need help with their English.  Special education provision in particular has undergone a level of expansion the extent of which nobody could have predicted a few years ago and this was only right.  If we had put all 4,000 of the teachers hired since 2002 into classroom teaching, our average class size would be a lot smaller than it is now, but we would have done a great disservice to those children who need extra help the most.  I am sure the Deputy would accept that we have taken the right approach.  Now that children with special needs are finally getting the support they deserve, we are providing extra teachers this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.  This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that, with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on, but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year we are committed to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.We also acted this year to specifically address the needs of growing schools by making it easier to qualify for a developing school post.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned for the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06.  This change specifically addressed the needs of schools which are seeing large increases in their enrolments year on year.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled, but we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	773	The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill vacancies in an individual primary school is a matter for the Board of Management of the school concerned.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in individual cases.  The person in question is a qualified second level teacher.  Qualifications recognised for the purposes of teaching at second level are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools.  At primary level teachers are class teachers, rather than subject specialists, and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged 4 to 12 years.  In order to obtain recognition to teach in mainstream primary schools, persons holding qualifications recognised for teaching at second level must successfully complete a recognised post-graduate primary conversion course.  Unqualified personnel should only be employed in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted.  The letter of 8th November referred to by the Deputy was answered by my Private Secretary on 21st November.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	775	The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including organising the holding of examinations and issuing the results of examinations.  The Commission has put in place a number of measures designed to enhance transparency and to put candidates in the best possible position with regard to deciding whether or not to appeal a result in a particular subject.  Following the issue of provisional results, all Leaving Certificate candidates are allowed to view their marked scripts.  For this, they are provided with a copy of the official marking scheme and may be accompanied, while viewing their scripts, by a person of their own choosing, for example a parent, teacher or subject expert.  Consequently, in many instances where an appeal is lodged, the candidate will have done so because the prospect of an upgrade has been seen to be very good.  The use of split grades in the Irish examination system means that all results from A2 to D3 correspond to 5% bands.  Results in these grade bands are of necessity within 2.5% (or the equivalent of one mark out of forty) of the nearest grade boundary.  The statistics provided in the attached table show that the number of upgrades awarded on appeal has remained constant over recent years at approximately 0.6% of the total number of grades awarded.20022003200420052006Grades issued362,545387,749380,013374,171333,762Grades Appealed9,58510,29910,13611,5829,290Upgrades2,0182,1922,0642,6511,998Upgrades as percentage of original results0.6%0.6%0.5%0.7%0.6%

I was happy to launch this initiative with Minister Angela Smith.  The establishment of such a committee was recommended in the National Youth Work Development Plan 2003-2007.  The Committee's purpose is, having developed a comprehensive framework for accreditation and certification in youth work on an All Ireland basis, to professionally endorse relevant youth work qualifications provided in the first instance by Higher Education Institutions.  In this regard, the Dundalk Institute of Technology had its Degree Programme in Youth Work endorsed for accreditation in September 2006 by the Committee.  Submissions from the University of Ulster at Jordanstown and the National University of Ireland, Maynooth for endorsement of their youth work courses are being considered by the Committee at present.

The main function of this Committee is to advise the Minister on the development of youth work policy.  Some eight sub-committees/working groups have been working on a range of issues since 2002 including a sub-committee charged with the development of guidelines and criteria for the roll out of the Act.  Such detailed guidelines and criteria are considered by all youth work interests to be necessary to ensure that the Act is rolled out in a strategic and coherent manner.  I am glad to report that these guidelines and criteria are nearing completion.  Other sub-committees are currently assisting with issues such as Child Protection for the youth work sector, youth welfare issues including alcohol misuse, the role of youth work in addressing educational disadvantage and assisting consultants in reviews of youth work funding and youth information provision.  The NYWAC also assisted in the planning and organisation of the Third National Youth Conference which I held in Croke Park in October this year.  This Committee is a valuable source of advice to me and my Department and its work and commitment to youth work issues is highly regarded.

Arising from this, a submission has been made to the local authority on estimated school site and school requirements for inclusion in the local area plan.  The Department has requested that two sites be reserved for the provision of four additional primary schools.  Owing to the level of spare capacity in existing Post-Primary schools in the area, the Department is not proposing additional post-primary provision at this time.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	781	The mainstream staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year is outlined in Primary Circular 0023/2006 which was issued to all primary schools. Based on an enrolment of 278 pupils on the 30th September 2005, as submitted by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the mainstream staffing warranted in the school for the 2006/2007 school year is a Principal and 10 mainstream class teachers.Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. A developing school is defined as a school where the enrolment on 30 September of one year is projected to exceed the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year by a minimum specified numerical increase and by having an excess of 5 pupils above the required appointment figure. The school in question has secured a developing school post for the 2006/2007 school year.The school also has the services of a learning support teacher and a language support teacher.The overall total staffing in the school for the current year is therefore Principal and 13 teachers.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	782	An upward trend in enrolment in recent years at the school referred to by the Deputy has necessitated a review by my Department of demographic trends, housing developments and enrolment trends in the area in order to ensure that any capital funding provided will deliver accommodation appropriate to the school's need into the future. Upon completion of this assessment a decision will be conveyed to the school on how best to provide for the school's long term accommodation needs. The project will then be considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme 2006-2010.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	783	As previously stated in my response to the Deputy, enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. My Department has no involvement in the criteria which individual schools choose to include in their enrolment policies. However, in formulating an admissions policy, a school must ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to my Department.   A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, my Department may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	784	Fee charging schools are a traditional feature of the post-primary educational system, particularly in Dublin. As the schools concerned are institutions that are privately owned and managed, the level and extent of school fees is a matter for the schools concerned.  A significant element of the fee-charging school sector has traditionally been made up of Protestant schools and those with a minority religious ethos. Fee-charging schools, with the exception of the special arrangements that apply in respect of the Protestant and Jewish fee paying schools, do not receive capitation or related supports. The Protestant and Jewish schools receive funding by way of a Block Grant, which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant and Jewish persuasion to attend schools, which reflect their denominational ethos. The Block Grant includes payments in respect of capitation.In relation to the application of fair and objective criteria for entry to second level schools including fee charging schools, a Memorandum of Understanding was agreed between my Department and the three post-primary managerial associations in 1993,  that the selection of pupils for enrolment in second-level schools should not be based on academic ability. Schools were notified of this agreement by Circular letter M51/93, which issued in December of that year.

My Department is currently awaiting confirmation from the school that they have completed this process.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	787	A curriculum in Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part of all programmes for primary students, and its implementation is also being assisted by a full-time support service. The programme begins in the infant classes and specifically addresses the need for regular exercise, and examines food and nutrition issues and the need for a balanced diet. The objective is that by fifth and sixth class, students are equipped to take responsibility for making wise food choices and adopting a healthy balanced diet, and in that context, exploring and examining the food pyramid.The strand ‘Myself' in the SPHE Curriculum is concerned with the personal development of the individual child and his/her health and well-being.  The content facilitates the development of a variety of personal and self-management skills and  fosters a sense of personal responsibility for their own actions and behaviour. Media education is addressed as an integral part of the strand ‘Myself and the Wider World'.  This aims to enable children to become aware of the purpose and nature of advertising and to explore how marketing and advertising can influence behaviour and opinion.At post-primary level, SPHE for Junior Cycle builds on the primary SPHE Curriculum.  All post-primary schools have been required to have SPHE as part of the Junior Cycle core curriculum since September 2003. In this way, all students are provided with the opportunity to develop the skills and competences to enable them to develop a framework for responsible decision-making and to promote their physical, mental and emotional health and well-being.Personal health issues are addressed in a holistic way in the post-primary SPHE curriculum.  Nutrition and physical activity are specifically addressed in the module on ‘Physical Health'.  Cross-curricular links with other subjects that deal with SPHE-related topics: Home Economics, PE and Junior Science, for example are encouraged.  It is a requirement, however, that SPHE is allocated discrete class time.Ongoing support to teachers and to schools in their implementation of the SPHE curricula is offered through the Primary Curriculum Support Programme and the Post-Primary SPHE Support Service.  In post-primary schools the implementation of SPHE is supported through partnership between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science together with the Health Boards.  Collaborative work between the SPHE team of the Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP) and Health Boards is also being undertaken.In addition to this, the Transition Year Programme, which is available to schools on an optional basis provides a flexible menu of options designed to further support pupils' personal and social development, to provide a bridge between junior and senior cycle and to offer a broad educational experience which can aid the maturing process. As part of this, many schools offer modules in Mental Health Matters.  All post-primary schools provide a guidance and counselling service for their students and they receive ex-quota hours from the Department for this provision.  Qualified guidance counsellors, working in second level schools, are trained to provide counselling support to students.While the specific occurrence of eating disorders among students constitutes an issue primarily for action by health authorities and the appropriate clinical intervention it is my experience that schools provide a caring environment within which school authorities and teachers will do their very best to ensure that, where aware, they support such students educational and wider personal needs.The services of my Departments National Educational Psychological Service (NEPs) are in turn available to schools to provide consultation and advice to parents and teachers and liaison with health services, where appropriate.The above is a broad outline of the significant provision that exists within the education system to address these very serious issues in our society and to provide our students with skills, understandings and supports to equip them for life in today's world.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	798	The Home/School/Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) is a major mainstream preventative strategy targeted at pupils at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system because of background characteristics which tend to affect adversely pupil attainment and school retention.  The scheme is concerned with establishing partnership and collaboration between parents and teachers in the interests of children's learning.  It focuses directly on the salient adults in children's educational lives and seeks indirect benefits for the children themselves.Under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, which is currently being implemented by my Department, I recently announced the allocation of 80 additional posts in order to extended Home School Community Liaison services to all 338 urban/town primary and 203 second level schools participating in the School Support Programme under DEIS that do not currently have the service, in addition to the 370 local coordinators already in place.In addition, schools in the HSCL scheme not selected under DEIS, including the two schools referred to by the Deputy, will continue to receive HSCL services after 2006/2007.  HSCL services will be provided to some 650 schools (282 second level and 370 primary schools), however, following a full review of HSCL clustering arrangements by my Department in the coming year, the level of service may change to some schools to ensure that all schools receive HSCL services in line with their level of disadvantage and size and to facilitate local HSCL coordinators working with families of disadvantaged children across both primary and second level.The rationale behind DEIS is to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from all of the available supports. Targeting resources at the most disadvantaged schools who are working to counteract educational disadvantage will continue to be a priority for the Government.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	799	I set out below for the Deputies information a count of the number of assessments delivered since the establishment of NEPs in 1999 by NEPs psychologists and under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term.  Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.Community colleges and vocational schools in the Dublin area have access to psychological services provided by the two VEC committees. In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them such schools have access to educational psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. NEPS also provides psychological services to schools in Dublin for children with visual impairment and for children with hearing impairment.  Since the establishment of the NEPS in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 123 at present. Four psychologists have recently been assigned to the National Behaviour Support Service of my Department and my Department is currently in the process of replacing those psychologists from an established panel resulting from a recruitment competition of last year.Development of psychological services must be seen in the context of all the initiatives and support services introduced by my Department in recent years, including the general allocation of resources to all schools, the DEIS programme, the establishment of the NBSS referred to above and the development of the NCSE (National Council for Special Education) and of the NEWB (National Education and Welfare Board).Academic YearNEPs PsychologistSCPA PsychologistTotal1999-20003,0513,0512000-20012,9782,9782001-20024,5362,9797,5152002-20034,8374,4479,2842003-20045,0243,5078,5312004-20055,9863,4759,4612005-20066,8004,06810,868

The application will be examined under the published criteria for major capital projects and the project will be considered for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2007 and onwards.Under the SCPA a fee of €330 is paid for each assessment commissioned.  This fee is all-inclusive and therefore the payment travel and subsistence does not arise.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	804	School building projects are selected for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need using published criteria.A significant number of new multi-denominational schools are established in rapidly developing areas. All infrastructural projects in these areas, regardless of ethos, are assigned a band 1 priority status under the criteria.  Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are being delivered in these areas in the fastest time-frame possible.This Government is delivering on its commitment to provide modern facilities in schools and has progressively increased funding in recent years with an aggregate total of over €2 billion alone between 2000 and 2005 and a commitment to invest a further €3b up to 2010. This is the largest investment programme in the history of the State.The Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to both rectify decades of under investment in school infrastructure and to meet newly emerging needs in the face of a huge expansion in our population base and the rapid expansion in teacher numbers. It has no desire to see any school in less than adequate accommodation and it will continue to tackle this issue in a structured and targeted fashion.

A new eight classroom school is currently under construction to accommodate the amalgamated school.  A decision on the amalgamation of these schools rests primarily with the Patron, subject only to my approval. I understand that the Patron has communicated with the Parents Committee of the school. It is now a matter for the Patron to officially appraise the Department of his position.

Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process, as the school authorities would usually alert the Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.The School Planning Section of the Department is not in receipt of any application for additional accommodation from the management authority of the school to which the Deputy refers.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	808	I propose to take Questions Nos. 452 and 547 together.I wish to assure the Deputies that I recognise the unique contribution of special schools in the education of children with special educational needs and am committed to further developing this area. This is why I have asked my officials to undertake a review of the role of the special school and the special class. With inclusion of pupils with special needs becoming a reality for many mainstream schools, it is essential to develop mechanisms to facilitate the sharing of expertise in special schools and to begin the process of creating ‘learning communities of schools'. The development of such a resource role for the special school is an acknowledgement by my Department of the value of these schools. My Department is most anxious that the skills and expertise that these schools have accumulated in supporting children with special needs is utilised to best advantage in providing for such children going forward. In addition, it will provide clear pathways towards enabling all schools within a geographical area to liaise professionally in a collaborative and co-operative fashion.The initial part of the review involves the gathering and collation of information and views in relation to special schools and classes.  This is being undertaken on behalf of my Department by St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dublin 9. It is envisaged that this part of the process will be completed by the end of December 2006. The second phase of the review will be managed by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and will involve wider consultation with the schools and other partners.The Deputies will be aware that in the context of increased investment in special education in 2007, I recently announced a significant increase in the rates of capitation grant paid to special schools. The increases range from a 30% increase in some payments to a near doubling of the rate for children with physical disabilities. These increases are a tangible demonstration of my commitment to supporting an important role for special schools. The extra payments for children in most special classes in mainstream schools are also being increased. The total cost of these measures will be €1.5 million.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	809	As the Deputy will be aware, there are now no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Furthermore, there are nearly 7,000 more primary teachers than there were in 1997. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those that need help with their English.Extra teachers are being provided this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule. This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year, we are committed to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.

The stakeholder meetings will include management, staff, pupils, parents, trade unions and other interested relevant local individuals or groups and will provide a detailed explanation of the PPP procurement process and the role of the individual schools in the bundled project.Other tasks to be undertaken as part of the pre-procurement process include the preparation of Output Specifications in respect of each school in the bundle, preparation of the Public Services Benchmark and the completion of all statutory requirements. When these tasks are completed the project bundle will be handed over to the National Development Finance Agency who will procure the projects on behalf of my Department.

Applications under this Scheme are currently being assessed and a list of successful applicants will be published when this process is complete.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	815	The decision on eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where. for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.If the candidate referred to by the Deputy has any further information to add to the initial grant application it should be forwarded to Kilkenny VEC directly.If an individual applicant considers that he/she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he/she may appeal to Kilkenny VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant Local Authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, the VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grant scheme regardless of the circumstances.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	817	The information is not readily available in the format sought by the Deputy for the period in question.However, I can assure the Deputy that the Government has made a record investment of over €2 billion in the period from 2000 to 2005 in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level. Over 6,500 projects were delivered in this period, including 76 new school buildings, 380 major refurbishment/extensions and over 6050 smaller scale projects. In addition the investment covered site purchases; the minor works grant issued to all primary schools annually, dust/asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science and technology initiatives, contingency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment. This year alone over 1,300 building projects will be delivered.I am also pleased that over recent years my Department has streamlined its processes for delivering projects with a particular emphasis placed on devolving the delivery of projects to local school management level.The infrastructural investment needs in schools will continue into the future. Building on the record investment in recent years the Government's has decided to provide €3.9 billion in capital funding for the education sector over the next 5 years. This is proof of its continuing commitment to educational infrastructure and will allow my Department to continue to take a pro-active approach in modernising school accommodation throughout the country.

This is currently being considered and my Department will convey its decision to the school authorities shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	819	I can confirm that correspondence was received in relation to the staffing in the school referred to by the Deputy.The mainstream staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year is outlined in Primary Circular 0023/2006 which was issued to all primary schools.Based on an enrolment of 224 pupils on the 30th September 2005, as submitted by the Board of Management of the school in question, the staffing warranted for the 2006/2007 school year is a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.A developing school is defined as a school where the enrolment on 30 September of one year is projected to exceed the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year by a specified minimum numerical increase and by having an excess of 5 pupils above the required appointment figure.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the school has secured a developing school post for the 2006/2007 school year based on the enrolment of 256 pupils as submitted by the Board of Management of the school on the 30th September 2006.The school also has the services of 1 Permanent DAS teacher, 3 Temporary Language Support teachers, 1 Permanent Learning Support/ Resource teacher and 7.5 part-time hours of resource teaching support under the General Allocation Scheme.The school is included in DEIS Urban Band 2 which entitles it to additional supports, including additional funding, access to home/school/liaison services and the schools meals programmes and access to a range of professional development supports.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	820	It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to unqualified personnel.The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill vacancies in an individual primary school is a matter for the Board of Management of the school concerned. It is the policy of my Department that unqualified personnel should only be employed in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted.Persons who serve as unqualified temporary or substitute teachers are entitled to holiday pay which is paid by my Department. Payment is made in accordance with the terms of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.My officials have been engaged in discussions with the education partners, with the guidance of a Facilitator, to consider the implementation of the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term) Act, 2003 in the context of the employment of fixed term workers. These discussions will address the conditions of service, including sick pay, of fixed term teachers. Boards of Management will be advised on the outcome of these discussions when finalised.Arrangements are currently being made, having regard to recent pension reforms, for the admission to pensionable service of persons who are employed in schools as unqualified teachers. Admission is with effect from 1 September, 2001 in the case of persons in service at that date or date of appointment if later. The detailed arrangements are being finalised and will also include provision for such teachers to reckon service given prior to 1 September, 2001 as pensionable subject to payment of appropriate contributions. The arrangement will apply to wholetime unqualified teachers and in the case of unqualified part-time teachers who have corresponding wholetime equivalents.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The building project for the School referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning. This School was among 40 Schools that I announced in April of this year to go to tender and construction on a rolling basis over the next 12 to 15 months.My Department's Officials wrote to the School Authorities on the 22nd September 2006 seeking a revised stage 1/2/3 (detailed plans / costs) submission. This revised stage 1/2/3 submission has been received in my Department and when it is has been reviewed my Department's Officials will be in further contact with the School Authorities as to the next steps involved in progressing this project.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	822	There are 497 teachers with restricted recognition currently working in primary schools. My Department does not have information on the number of such teachers here who are not in employment in primary schools.Restricted recognition gives eligibility to teach in certain categories of special schools and in categories of special classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement. Teachers with such recognition are also entitled to take up positions in special schools for young offenders, youth encounter projects and special education projects. They may also take up positions as substitute teachers.Restricted recognition is granted to teachers, who trained outside the State and who hold a recognised primary teacher qualification, and to teachers with certain approved Montessori qualifications i.e. the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) College, Dublin or teachers with the B.A. in humanities in Montessori Education from St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dún Laoghaire.Restricted recognition is also granted to teachers with a recognised post-primary qualification to enable them to teach in a special school where a proportion of pupils attending the special school are of post-primary age and where second level programmes are being provided by the school.Teachers with restricted recognition, working in posts that their recognition entitles them to hold, are entitled to the same conditions of service as fully recognised teachers.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	823	I wish to advise the Deputy that the information in relation to the number of temporary teachers in the primary system who teach children in the low-incidence special educational needs categories is not readily available.Many teaching posts that cater for pupils in the low-incidence categories also cater for pupils with high-incidence special educational needs and learning support requirements.Under my Department's Circular 0036/2006 all learning support/resource teacher (LS/RT) posts that were temporary or fixed term in schools in the 2005/2006 school year may be re-categorised as permanent posts for 2006/2007 school year and onwards, provided the criteria for retaining the posts are met. It is also the case that any new LS/RT or resource teacher (RT) posts will be regarded as permanent. A fulltime post consists of 25 hours per week. A minimum of 22 hours, comprising low-incidence hours or a combination of low-incidence hours and general allocation hours is required to create or retain a first post. Where schools or clusters of schools cannot bring enough hours together to create or retain a fulltime permanent post the school may recruit part-time teachers for the hours required. Fulltime and part-time posts exist only for as long as the posts are warranted.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The Deputy will be aware that my Department, in consultation with educational interests, introduced a new General Allocation system of teacher support to all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, that is, pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs. This model, which was announced in 2004 and came into effect in September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils with these special educational needs.The new system has a number of benefits associated with it:It puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels;It facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place when the child enrols; andIt allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services.The new system means that rather than schools having to make individual applications for resources for such pupils, resources are provided in advance to the school. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school will have enough General Allocation teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.The school can then use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are allocated to the pupils in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some pupils with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource/learning support teachers to work with pupils in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the pupils then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the pupil.My Department issued a comprehensive circular (Sp Ed 02/05) to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. It is anticipated that a review of general allocations will be undertaken after three years of operation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	825	A revised literature course for Leaving Certificate Irish was introduced in September 2004 for examination in 2006, in 2007 and in 2008.This has been widely welcomed as it allows literature to be taught using modern communicative approaches that appeal to young people and it affords a high level of choice to students and teachers. For example, film became an option for the first time.A comprehensive set of guidelines to support teachers in delivering the revised course has been issued.I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to prioritise its work on curriculum provision for Irish in post-primary education and to make proposals to me as soon as possible on how the syllabuses should be reformed. I have requested that particular emphasis be placed on strengthening students' communicative skills, especially their oral fluency.I am committed to ensuring that Irish is taught in our schools in a way that is interesting and relevant and will promote a positive attitude to the language among our young people.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	830	In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, the approved course for the established Leaving Certificate must include not less than five approved examination subjects, of which one must be Irish. The exception to this is where a student has been granted an exemption from the study of Irish under the terms of my Department's circular letter M10/94.There is no requirement to sit any particular subject in the established Leaving Certificate Examination in order to be awarded a certificate. Each candidate will be awarded a certificate showing the grades obtained by him/her in whatever examinations have been taken, regardless of the overall number of subjects.Provisional figures indicate that out of 50,955 candidates who sat the established Leaving Certificate or the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) examinations in 2006, some 43,928 took the subject Irish (4543 at Foundation Level; 26,437 at Ordinary Level and 12,948 at Higher Level).

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	840	As the Deputy is aware the new school to which he refers opened in September 2005. The school was given approval to enrol two Junior Infant Classes per year and, when fully occupied, will operate as a two-stream 16-classroom school. This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over enrolment in the early stages and crucially, to ensure that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected.Notwithstanding this position and as an exceptional matter, the school authority has been given approval to enrol three junior infants classes for the 2006/07 school year only, on the grounds that this will not impact negatively on the other schools in question.Approval has also been given to enrol an additional 40 pupils up the classes that could not obtain places in other schools in the area. Pupils moving into the area in the course of the school year can also enrol in the school on the same basis.I am aware that Sallins, Naas, and Kill, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by the Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas.The School Planning Section of the Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	844	My Department commenced a Radon Remediation Programme in 1998 when it commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to conduct a survey of radon levels in all primary and post primary schools.The programme initially involved surveying radon levels in schools and subsequently carrying out mitigation works where appropriate. The programme is 100% funded by my Department and has cost approximately €6m to date.All schools have been advised of the programme and where excess radon levels are located, funding is provided for the mitigation works. Follow-up monitoring also takes place to ensure that the remediation action has been successful.The remaining handful of schools who have not agreed to participate in the radon surveys are regularly advised of the need to do so.  Radon barriers are included in the design of all new school building projects.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	845	All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessment service either directly from the National Educational Psychological Service or from the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments, details of which are available on my Department's website.In common with many other psychological services, NEPS operates a staged model of service to schools, whereby an initial referral usually leads to a consultation and provision of advice to teachers and parents on appropriate teaching and management strategies. Progress is kept under review and only those children who fail to respond to these interventions will need to see a psychologist. This allows the psychologists to offer early appointments to children who are in urgent need of support and early advice to teachers in respect to those children whose needs are perhaps less pressing but who still need additional help in school.NEPS also provides support to all school communities that experience critical incidents. The complement of psychologists has increased from 43 on the date of establishment in September 1999 to 127 psychologists in November 2006. This includes 4 psychologists have been assigned to the National Behaviour Support Service. A further 2 psychologist are on career break.Six (6) further appointments will be made shortly from the current panel organised by the Public Appointments Service. Recruitment from that panel, which established regional panels has facilitated my Department in to give greater priority in filling vacancies in areas of greatest need.I am pleased to inform the deputy that the financial provision in the 2007 Estimates will allow additional posts to be allocated in 2007. I have yet to determine the number of posts. Decisions on deployment will be taken in advance of the recruitment process.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	851	The Deputy will be aware that the staffing schedule for primary schools is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 28 pupils. Posts allocated on the basis of this schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a Principal, 7 mainstream class teachers (based on an enrolment of 187 pupils on 30th September, 2005) and 2 Permanent Learning Support/Resource teachers.The enrolment figure submitted by the Board of Management for the 30th September, 2006 is 196 pupils.

Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.A developing school is defined as a school where the enrolment on 30 September of one year is projected to exceed the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year by a minimum specified numerical increase and by having an excess of 5 pupils above the required appointment figure.The school has secured 6 developing school posts for the 2006/2007 school year based on the enrolment of 216 pupils as submitted by the Board of Management of the school on the 30th September, 2006. The school also has the services of 1 Permanent Learning Support/Resource teacher, 1 Permanent Special Class Teacher and 3 Temporary Language Support teachers.  The overall total staffing of the schools for the current school year is therefore Principal and 13 teachers.

Progress on the project is being considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme from 2007 onwards.At post primary level, there is currently no application from Scoil Mhuire Community School for additional accommodation.  It is open to the school authorities of the schools in Clane to apply for temporary accommodation to offset any immediate short-term accommodation needs.  The School Planning Section of my Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	871	I propose to take Questions Nos. 526 and 527 together.I am aware that Sallins, Naas, and Kill , like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by the Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas.At primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee. In addition, a brand new 16 classroom school together with temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth's & St. Mary's NS and St. Conleth's Naofa in Naas. Temporary accommodation has also been provided at one of the two nearby national schools at Caragh. On top of this, approval has been given to Gaelscoil Nás na Ríogh, Caragh NS and Kill NS for additional accommodation for September 2006. Gaelscoil Nás na Ríogh has recently been approved to commence architectural planning for the provision of a new 16-classroom school.At Sallins National School, a seven classrooms extension is completed and this extension has increased capacity from 9 classrooms to 16 classrooms. An extension to bring the school up to 24 classrooms has commenced architectural planning.These are practical examples of the extent of the extra provision being made in terms of additional school places throughout the area.  These and many other initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate the commitment to meeting the needs of the area concerned. The School Planning Section of the Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	872	The School Planning Section of the Department has received an application for major capital funding from the management authorities of the school to which the Deputy refers. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale projects. Progress on the proposed works is being considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme from 2007 onwards.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	873	The process of appointing a design team to the proposed building project at the school referred to by the Deputy has commenced.On behalf of the Client (the School Board of Management) the School Building Section of the Department published the advertisement seeking the relevant consultancy services on the public procurement portal, www.etenders.gov.ie, on 15 August last. The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest under this EU procurement process was 12 noon on Monday 9 October 2006 and all submissions were returned to the Board of Management, in order for them to conduct the assessment of those submissions.As soon as the Board of Management has completed the assessment exercise, and the School Building Section has ratified their recommendations, the architectural planning phase of the project will begin.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	874	I propose to take Questions Nos. 530 to 535, inclusive, together.The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department and would take an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.As the Deputy will be aware, there are now no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Furthermore, there are nearly 7,000 more primary teachers than there were in 1997. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.The number of children in large classes has been significantly reduced. When this Government first came into office, there were more than 52,000 children in classes of 35 and over — five times the number that there were in the last school year. There were also more than 1,900 children in classes of 40 and over — compared to just over 200 in 05/06.While I appreciate the need to make further progress in reducing class size, it should be acknowledged just how much has been achieved. In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those that need help with their English.Special education provision in particular has undergone a level of expansion the extent of which nobody could have predicted a few years ago — and this was only right. If we had put all 4,000 of the teachers hired since 2002 into classroom teaching, our average class size would be a lot smaller than it is now. But we would have done a great disservice to those children who need extra help the most. I am sure the Deputy would accept that we have taken the right approach.Now that children with special needs are finally getting the support they deserve, we are providing extra teachers this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.   This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year, we are committed to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.We also acted this year to specifically address the needs of growing schools by making it easier to qualify for a developing school post. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned for the 2006/07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005/06. This change specifically addressed the needs of schools which are seeing large increases in their enrolments year on year.On the Post Primary side allocations are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post leaving Cert courses and Leaving Cert Applied.Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13:1 in the 2005/06 school year.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	875	The Department has not received any application for additional accommodation from the school referred to by the Deputy.The school authorities should contact the School Planning Section of the Department if it has concerns in this regard.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	876	I propose to take Questions Nos. 537, 543, 545 and 546 together.As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at both primary and post-primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools. 170 such posts were sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared to 105 in 2004/05.The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas including the impact of inward migration and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.In planning for school provision to meet these demands the Department has adopted an area based approach which involves a public consultation process involving all interested parties. This leads to the production of a blueprint for schools' development in an area for a timeframe of approximately ten years. The exercise recently completed on the N4-M4 corridor is an example of this and the rapidly developing areas of north Dublin, south Louth and east Meath are being examined this year. This structured process will ensure a more proactive approach to school planning than had been the case in the past.Apart from the area development planning process the Department is also proactively engaged with local authorities on a continual basis in relation to specific areas. This is being done through improved contacts and communication protocols to ensure that the Department is better alerted about new and expanding residential areas and afforded an opportunity to ensure appropriate zoning provision for educational purposes.For example in the case of the Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) at Adamstown the Department is working closely with South Dublin County Council and the developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing. Under the SDZ arrangements there is a requirement that schools are in position ahead of or in line with demand, and I think it is one that should be adopted by other planning authorities in relation to major new housing schemes.The Department is working particularly closely with Fingal County Council to develop a joint approach to the timely provision of schools in an area of the country subject to extremely rapid development. This work is providing innovative approaches to partnership which I believe can be used to advantage across the country in future.The Department prioritises school buildings for rapidly developing areas. This is achieved by assigning them a band one priority rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. Whenever possible, the Department implements a standardised design model or a design and build process to fast track delivery of the buildings themselves. Not alone does this result in speedier delivery of projects but it also achieves savings in design fees and land use arising from the use of the two storey design. Among schools completed using one of these processes is Griffeen Valley in Lucan which was completed in a 13 month timeframe.The level of work being done under the schools building programme is at an all-time high. While increased investment is a central reason for this — €500m this year alone — radical changes in how projects are planned and managed have also made a major difference in ensuring that provision is delivered in line with or ahead of demand.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	877	My Department contributes fully to the overall aim of the Government's policy in relation to drugs, which is to provide an effective, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse. As part of this process, my Department is represented at senior level on the National Drugs Strategy Team and on the Interdepartmental Group which in turn reports to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. In addition, my Department is represented on all Drugs Task Forces, both Local and Regional.My Department has taken a number of initiatives to counteract substance misuse in schools, including alcohol.In October 2002, my Department issued guidelines to all schools to assist them in the development of School Substance Use Policies. These guidelines were developed in partnership with the Department of Health and Children and the then Health Boards. The central objective of a school's substance use policy is the welfare, care and protection of every young person in line with the Education Act, 1998 and the Education Welfare Act, 2000.The policy is intended to address both education concerning alcohol, tobacco, drugs and other dangerous substances and the procedures for managing incidents relating to them.Drug prevention education is implemented as part of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curricula in primary and post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum is mandatory in all primary schools and post-primary schools up to Junior Certificate Level and substance use is one of 10 modules taught. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment SPHE course committee is currently finalising a Framework SPHE curriculum for Senior Cycle Students at post-primary level. This will be submitted to my Department for consideration.In addition, my Department currently funds 36 mainstreamed Local Drug Task Force projects at a cost of over €3m.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	878	I propose to take Questions Nos. 539 and 541 together.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department's Estimates for 2007 include a provision of €9.8 million for the National Educational Welfare Board. This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level.This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk. Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.The increase in funding for the Board will allow it to expand its services further and increase to staffing.Since we formally launched the Board in December 2003, the number of staff has increased to 94. The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide. Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Educational Welfare Officers monitor school attendance and work to improve it. They also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.Since January 2004, 20,000 cases involving students with reported school attendance difficulties have been resolved by the Board. The NEWB has also written to every family with children of school going age advising them of their rights and responsibilities in relation to education and school attendance and where they can get help.The first national data on school attendance has also been collected and is being used to inform the Board's work. In relation to the effectiveness of the service, it is encouraging to note research findings that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved in 2004/05 compared with the previous year.The Board is currently working on guidelines for schools on developing attendance strategies and the prevention of student absenteeism. Work is also advanced on guidelines for codes of behaviour.So, while the NEWB was set up just three years ago, a lot has already been achieved by the service and the Government is committed to strengthening its role even further.It should, however, be remembered that the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and services such as breakfast clubs and homework clubs.In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently some 490 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school. School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies. Access to these services is being increased under the new Action Plan for tackling educational disadvantage, DEIS.In reply to the Deputy's specific question regarding the deployment of service delivery staff on a county basis, the NEWB is a independent statutory body and operational matters such as the deployment of staff are for the Board to decide upon.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	879	This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. A key focus of the Government's education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion that I launched last year, will focus on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second-level education (3 to 18 years). The plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multifaceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3–18 year olds in this country.The key principle of early intervention underpins both the early childhood education measure and many of the literacy and numeracy measures being adopted under the new action plan. The plan will place a renewed emphasis on the involvement of parents and families in children's education in schools.Implementation will be a phased basis over five years and will involve an additional annual investment of some €40m on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.A further measure designed to deal with absenteeism from school was the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board, under the Education Welfare Act, 2002. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The Board has responsibility to monitor school attendance, assist parents with obtaining a school place for their child run promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school and conducting research into the causes for and strategies to combat absenteeism.The general functions of the NEWB are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents/ guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board's functions locally.The NEWB through their local EWO has involvement with the Garda Junior Liaison Scheme. There are regular and ongoing contacts made by way of referrals to the HSE where the EWO has concerns regarding the welfare or care of a child. There is also attendance and participation by EWOs at Child Care Conferences and meetings convened by the HSE.The Board, appointed an expert group in November 2005 to draw up a discussion document on the guidelines for schools on developing Codes of Behaviour. The Guidelines will focus on how schools can deal progressively and inclusively with behavioural issues, thereby helping to support participation in education for all. Poor behaviour impacts on the learning and teaching environment in a school and valuable class time can be taken up managing it and can also be a barrier to good attendance and participation in school activities.In addition to the NEWB there are some 490 staff, within the education sector, deployed in education disadvantage programmes. A further 137 additional posts will come into the system under the DEIS Initiative. The work of these personnel involves an element of school attendance and significant scope exists for integrated working with Educational Welfare Officers. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from this deployment of resources. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed including NEWB resources.Earlier this year, I launched "School Matters" the final Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, and outlined a package of measures to tackle student behaviour issues and announced an implementation strategy following publication of "School Matters". That strategy is now well advanced.The National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS), which was at the core of the recommendations of the Task Force, has now  appointed a National Co-ordinator and four Assistant National Co-ordinators. In addition, nine Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates have been recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative. A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a senior psychologist and three psychologists. These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way. A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues:1. The development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement.2. The development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and impact on classroom and whole school behaviour.3. On-going training for the NBSS team.4. Research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.The NBSS has commenced its engagement with schools and a series of information seminars have been organised throughout the country. Subsequently intensive work will begin with a smaller number of schools most in need of this intervention.It is my intention that this new service will work intensively with those schools initially selected for inclusion in this development. I have already announced that part of this work will see us trialling the concept of a behaviour support classroom in up to 30 schools next year. I want to emphasise however that these classrooms cannot be, in themselves, a solution to the issue of poor student behaviour. They must be one part of a holistic response which should see a school, actively supported by the Behaviour Support Team, defining for itself a pathway to improvement.In relation to the Task Force recommendations in respect of class size, I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to the significant improvements that have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.21:1 in the 2005/06 school year. The reduction in the ratio was achieved through the creation of 2,017 additional posts and the retention of over 2,100 posts which would otherwise have been lost due to the fall in enrolments. I should add that I have consistently ruled out the creation of additional teaching posts across the second level system as a response to the issue of poor student behaviour. On the contrary I see this issue as requiring focussed intervention along the lines now being pursued.It terms of expenditure, funding has been provided to cover the costs of the NBSS recruitment process, staff training and development, staff salaries, establishment of an NBSS Office, development of an NBSS website and the information seminars with schools. At this stage, it is anticipated that the €2 million allocated in 2006 toward the implementation of the Task Force's recommendations will be fully expended by the end of the current financial year.I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement in the context of the 2007 Estimates, that I am providing €8 million to support the work of the NBSS, in helping schools promote positive student behaviour at second level.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	880	I share the Deputy's concern that any child would feel upset in school because of bullying — be it physical, verbal or cyber and I assure him that supports are in place to enable schools both to prevent bullying and to deal with cases that may arise.For a start, each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school. My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education has also developed Policy Guidelines and Advisory Notes for schools and parents which deal with the issues of internet and mobile phone bullying.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is at present developing further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. Work on the guidelines is at an advanced stage and will be informed by broad consultation. It is envisaged that implementation will commence in the current school year.Once the NEWB Guidelines are in place, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own "Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour". This review will take into account issues such as legislative developments, the involvement of the support services available to schools, technological advancements such as use of the Internet, e-mail, mobile phones and camera phones and the latest developments in International best practice on dealing with bullying behaviour.These guidelines, on top of those that are already in place, will provide vital guidance for schools in fulfilling their responsibilities in relation to this issue. The Deputy may also be interested to know that dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for Principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme.I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.The Deputy will also be aware that the education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.In relation to the Deputy's query about reports to my Department, there is no requirement for schools to report incidents of bullying to my Department, nor do I believe that this should be the case. Responsibility for tackling bullying naturally falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established. I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that so many supports have been put in place in recent years.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	881	I wish to advise the Deputy that responsibility for the provision of speech and language therapy services rests with the Health Service Executive. However, I can confirm that my Department has sanctioned 59 special classes for children with specific speech and language disorder. Each class can cater for up to 7 children and the children have access to a speech and language therapist.In May 2002, my Department approved the provision of 175 additional therapy training places to tackle shortages of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists as identified in the report "Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists", which was undertaken by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in 2001.Within this provision there was an increase of 75 places on new courses in Speech and Language Therapy courses. These increased intakes will result in a significant increase in the number of Speech and Language Therapists graduating from the third level sector.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	882	In June 2006 the Government launched the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation. This Strategy is a multi-annual, multi-billion euro investment in research and development activity for the period to 2013. The Strategy will see Ireland secure its position as one of the world's advanced knowledge economies and become renowned worldwide for the excellence of its research. It will put the benefits and opportunities of science, technology and innovation at the heart of Irish economic and social development, grow our enterprise sector in a sustainable manner and facilitate social advancement.It is a major milestone in the development of our national architecture for research and development and an essential stimulus to the achievement of Ireland's strategic economic and social goals over the coming years. The education system at all levels will be central in delivering on this strategy.  Details of action areas for science education at both primary and secondary levels are outlined in the Strategy.A blueprint for Ireland's advancement has been provided in this Strategy.  Central to this will be the development of the capacity of our higher education system for the achievement of key targets during the lifetime of the Strategy such as doubling the number of PhD graduates, for attaining the necessary intellectual critical mass, for advancing the quality of our post-graduate and PhD training, for strengthening arrangements for industry collaboration and for providing all the necessary supporting structures to achieve the research objectives of a range of sectors.   The growth of fourth level education under the strategy will have a major impact on the profile of our higher education institutions.The educational elements of the strategy will be progressed over the life of the plan. The Programme for Research at Third Level Institutions is a key element in delivering on the objective of doubling the number of PhD graduates and the estimates for 2007 show a 15% increase over 2006 in the provision for research including the funding for a further call for proposals from institutions under cycle 4 of this programme.

At this stage a total of 31 staff have confirmed their availability to decentralise with this Department to Waterford, with 15 of these currently assigned and working in the Department; the process of arranging for the transfer of the other staff to the Department is continuing.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	888	I refer to the reply to Question No. 574 of 21 November 2006.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	889	I propose to take Questions Nos. 555, 558, 559 and 565 together.Local authorities are required to recover the cost of providing water services from all users of these services, with the exception of householders.  Waiver provisions in relation to local government services are intended only to address cases of personal hardship and would therefore not accommodate schools or other non-profit organisations.  In order to provide a transparent and equitable cost recovery mechanism for water services, as envisaged by the EU Water Framework Directive, local authorities are now moving towards the metering of all non-domestic users.  Metering of water usage should incentivise all non-domestic users, including schools, to conserve their use of water and so minimise this element of their running costs.Article 9.1 of the EU Water Framework Directive requires Member States to take account of the principle of water services cost recovery, including environmental and resource costs, in accordance with the polluter pays principle.  The Directive is being implemented in Ireland in relation to the non-domestic sector on the basis of recovery of all non-domestic water services costs, including marginal capital costs and operational, administrative and meter installation costs, from those users of the services.Following a pilot billing project in one local authority area, and having regard to discussions conducted with farming representatives, I am arranging for the billing guidance being prepared for local authorities to include a request that authorities consider the impact of their charging arrangements for water meters on multiple fragmented small farm holdings when deciding their water charges.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	890	The principal statutes governing welfare and prevention of cruelty to domestic animals, including dogs and cats, are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965.   As responsibility for that legislation is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food, it would not be appropriate for my Department to take on the lead role in relation to the Convention referred to in the Question.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	892	I propose to take Questions Nos. 560 and 561 together.Under the provisions of section 211 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a decision to dispose of local authority land, including the granting of a lease, is a matter for the relevant local authority and my Department has no power under that Act to direct an authority to exercise such power in individual cases.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	893	As required under the Disability Act 2005, my Department's sectoral plan was approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas in October 2006. The plan, covering my Department, its partner bodies and local authorities, sets out national objectives and guidelines for access to public buildings, services, amenities, and information, as well as to heritage sites and other facilities. The plan provides for a range of positive measures, including improvements to Part M of the Building Regulations, the introduction of a new Disability Access Certificate and the development of a Housing Strategy for people with disabilities. The implementation of these measures will promote and pro-actively encourage equal opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economic, social and cultural life of the community.Significant progress is being made on the implementation of my Department's sectoral plan. The Building Control Bill 2005 is before the Oireachtas and is expected to be enacted in the first quarter of 2007. The Bill provides for a Disability Access Certificate and will strengthen enforcement powers of Building Control Authorities as well as simplify the prosecution process. In addition, the Review of Part M of the Building Regulations is ongoing; following receipt of more than 40 submissions during the preliminary public consultation phase, a Building Regulations Advisory Board (BRAB) Expert Working Group will shortly submit preliminary draft proposals to amend Part M regime for consideration by BRAB.The review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme has been finalised within my Department. The aim of the review has been to refocus the available funding, to streamline the procedures governing the operation of the grant schemes, and to heighten consistency in operation across local authorities. The revised grant scheme will be published and implemented in early 2007.Investment by local authorities to meet the needs of people with disabilities, and to fulfil their obligations under the Disability Act 2005, is being directed toward providing new or improved access to and within public buildings, amenities, streetscapes etc, including electronic equipment and adaptations, and towards training, accessibility audit work, improved access to information services, software etc. I have provided €18 million in 2006 to help local authorities and other bodies under the aegis of my Department to implement the National Disability Strategy, as part of a multi-annual funding programme, begun in 2005, which will continue until 2009.I do not envisage delays in the timetable as set out in the sectoral plan.

However, there are a number of selectively targeted schemes currently in operation under which grant-aid is available for the provision of heating systems.  These schemes are outlined as follows:Essential Repairs Grant SchemeThe essential repairs grant enables people in houses, which cannot be made habitable in all respects at a reasonable cost, to have basic works, including the provision of central heating, carried out to them.  The scheme is directed primarily at older persons living in poor housing conditions. It is operated by local authorities on the basis of partial recoupment of their expenditure (generally two thirds) by my Department.Special Housing Aid for the Elderly SchemeAid is available under the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is operated by the Health Service Executive, for necessary repairs to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant.  In 2000, the scheme was extended to include the provision of suitable heating systems where found necessary to meet the needs of elderly persons.Disabled Persons Grant SchemeThe disabled persons grant scheme provides for the payment of a grant to a person for the provision of additional accommodation or the carrying out of works of adaptation that, in the opinion of the housing authority, are reasonably necessary for the purpose of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation of a disabled member of the household. The scheme is operated by local authorities whose expenditure on grants is partially recouped (generally two thirds) by my Department. Guidelines for the scheme state that local authorities may assist in the provision of heating under the scheme in certain circumstances.A review of these schemes was recently completed within my Department.  Proposals for the future operation of the schemes are being prepared and are expected to be announced early next year in the context of a new Housing Policy Statement.

NPWS provides a number of facilities in Glendalough, including a Visitor Information Point near the Upper Lake and picnic facilities.Glendalough also enjoys the services of eight NPWS guides and is supported by four general operatives who also work in the general National Park area.In recent years a number of works have been undertaken to improve visitor facilities in the area.  A boardwalk around the lower lake at Glendalough has been completed, offering those with physical disabilities, in particular, easy access between the monastic site and the Upper Lake.  The boardwalk, which cost some €112,000, formed part of a programme to provide nine way-marked routes around the National Park.A Sensory Garden has also been developed at a cost of some €7,000, with the valued advice of the Irish Wheelchair Association, among others, at the information point near the Upper Lake.  This Garden provides a stimulating and relaxing environment for those with a visual impairment in particular.The NPWS Education Centre at Bolger's Cottage, beside the Upper Lake, has been restored recently at a cost of some €105,000 and has allowed a significant expansion of the education programme there.

While there are no specific grants available from my Department for the construction of cattle underpasses on the non-national road network, local authorities may use discretionary improvement grants provided by my Department towards the cost of providing such underpasses. In 2006, the discretionary improvement grant allocation to county councils is €24.27 million.  In addition, in cases where my Department is providing grant assistance for the provision of new non-national roads or improvements to existing non-national roads, it is open to local authorities to include underpasses as part of such schemes in circumstances where they are deemed to be appropriate by the authority.My Department has no function in relation to national roads.  Responsibility for national roads is a matter for the relevant road authority and the National Roads Authority which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Transport.

In the event of such an application, my Department would be consulted in relation to wildlife and conservation implications and would submit any views to the Forest Service as necessary.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	899	My Department is in ongoing communication with the European Commission regarding the measures which continue to be put in place to comply with the wide-ranging judgment of the European Court of Justice in Case C-282/02 in relation to implementation of the Dangerous Substances Directive in Ireland.One of the measures proposed is the licensing of urban waste water discharges from local authority treatment plants.  Consultations are taking place between my Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the European Commission and other relevant Government Departments on a draft of regulations which it is proposed to make under section 59 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  The proposed regulations will provide for a framework for the licensing of such discharges and give further effect to provisions of the EU Dangerous Substances Directive (76/464/EEC) and the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC).

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	902	Section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was commenced with effect from 28 April 2004.  It introduced a once-off system of registration for all quarries, except those for which planning permission was granted in the preceding 5 years.  Under the registration system quarry operators were required to supply full details of their operations to the planning authority, including information on the area of the quarry, the material being extracted, the hours of operation, and the traffic, noise and dust generated by the quarry.  This information was required to be supplied within a year, i.e. by 27 April 2005.Under Section 261, each planning authority was obliged, among other things:to enter in its register the information required to be supplied by quarry owners as part of the registration procedure;to publish a notice of registration in one or more newspapers circulating in its area not later than 6 months from the registration.  This notice was required to state:that the quarry had been registered in accordance with section 261;whether the quarry had been granted planning permission or not;where a quarry had been granted planning permission whether the planning authority was considering restating, modifying or adding to the conditions attached to the planning permission;where a quarry had not been granted planning permission whether the planning authority was considering imposing conditions (for quarries which were operating prior to 1 October 1964) or requiring the quarry owner/operator to make a planning application and to submit an environmental impact statement;the place or places where the register may be inspected; andthat submissions or observations regarding the operation of the quarry may be made to the planning authority within 4 weeks from the date of publication of the notice; andto notify the quarry owner or operator of a proposal to impose, restate, modify or add to conditions on the operation of the quarry or to require a planning application to be made and an environmental impact statement to be submitted,  after the 4 week period for observations or submissions had elapsed.  The notice is required to state the reasons for the proposal, and that the owner or operator could make submissions or observations to the planning authority within a set period being not less than 6 weeks from the date of the notice.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	903	Local authorities have extensive powers under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 to deal with the problem of anti social behaviour.  In fulfilment of commitments in the Housing Policy statement — Building Sustainable Communities, I am reviewing the provisions of this Act with a view to strengthening their powers.The powers of the Gardaí in dealing with this issue were recently enhanced under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The Garda Síochána Act 2005 further supports these efforts and provides for the establishment of joint policing committees — representative of local authorities, the Gardaí, other public bodies and community interests — whose statutory function includes reviewing the level and patterns of anti-social behaviour and advising on measures to tackle such behaviour.  Clearly, the issue of anti social behaviour is best addressed with by a co-ordinated response from all relevant agencies and I am fully supportive of such an approach.

An increased provision of €3.7 million is available to fund the Board's administration and services in 2006, compared with an outturn of €1.737 million in 2005. There is currently a total of 51.5 staff working in the Board. The Board has also engaged a panel of 175 mediators and adjudicators to assist with its dispute resolution functions. It is a matter for the Board to prioritise the allocation of resources and to keep the adequacy of such resources under review.

Available information indicates that at 31 December 2005 there were an estimated 2,500 vacant local authority dwellings, exclusive of vacant dwellings which are subject of planned refurbishment/remedial programmes.   It is not possible to determine from these general figures how many dwellings are boarded up and out of use.
