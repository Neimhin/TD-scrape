#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	1	I welcome everyone to this morning's meeting. We have received apologies from Deputy Colm Burke. Members and witnesses attending from within the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of the Parliament due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where parliament has chosen to sit. The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied by Ms Paula O'Connor, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This morning we will engage with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to examine the following: the 2021 appropriation accounts 2021 for Vote 34, Housing, Local Government, and Heritage; the Local Government Fund account 2021; and from the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021, Chapter 4 - re-allocation of voted funds, Chapter 6 - central government funding of local authorities, and Chapter 7 - the Housing Agency’s revolving acquisition fund. We are joined from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage by Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General; Ms Caroline Timmons, assistant secretary, housing affordability, inclusion and homelessness; Mr. David Kelly, principal officer; Mr. Feargal Ó Coigligh, assistant secretary, housing policy, legislation and governance, who was here last week and is again welcome; Mr. Paul Hogan, principal adviser, planning; and Ms Sinead O'Gorman, principal officer. We are also joined by Ms Clare Costello, principal officer, from the relevant Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. They are all very welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off or on silent. Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference you may make to other persons in your evidence. As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of presentations they make to the committee. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I now call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	2	The 2021 appropriation account for Vote 34, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, records gross expenditure of €5.143 billion. The appropriation account is presented under six programme headings. The largest by value are the housing programme, water services programme and the programme to support local government, which together account for 95% of the gross expenditure under the Vote. The surplus of the amount provided over the net amount applied in the year was €392 million. Of this, €276 million related to unspent 2021 capital allocations was carried forward to 2022. Just under €117 million was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer. I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the appropriation account. However, I drew attention to a note in the account that discloses payment of a fine to the European Commission arising from a judgment of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, in November 2019. The case concerned Ireland’s failure to ensure that a retrospective environmental impact assessment was carried out in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway. The fine imposed by the court comprises a €5 million lump sum payment paid in 2020 plus a daily fine of €15,000 while the infringement continues, plus legal costs. By end 2021, the Department had paid fines totalling €13.2 million and a further liability of €3.5 million had accrued. The daily fine continued to be incurred into 2022. The Accounting Officer will be able to provide an update in that regard. The Local Government Fund is managed by the Department and accounted for separately from the Vote. The fund comprises mainly Exchequer funding from Vote 34 and the proceeds of local property tax. In 2021, local property tax receipts into the fund amounted to €550 million. This was up marginally from the level of receipts in 2020. The transfer to the fund from the Vote in 2021 amounted to €699 million. This was down €357 million, or 34% year on year, due to a decline in the cost of the Covid-related commercial rates waiver. The fund expenditure in 2021 amounted to €1.23 billion. At end December 2021, the fund’s reserves stood at just over €159 million. Again, I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the fund account. Because of the complex ways that central government funds flow to individual local authorities, my office compiles a report each year to present an overview of the level and purposes of the funding provided. In 2021, funding to local authorities from central government sources amounted to a total of €5.77 billion; a decrease of approximately 5% on the €6.08 billion provided in 2020. More than 90% of the central government funding for local authorities came from three sources, namely, Vote 34 - the Local Government Fund and Vote 31 - Transport. Of the total of €5.77 billion central government funding, €2.8 billion was provided to local authorities for housing and regeneration. A further €1.3 billion was provided to local authorities for transport investment.The committee previously considered the issue of reallocation of voted funds that was not in compliance with the procedures set out in public financial procedures, as outlined in chapter 4. One of the cases referred to in the chapter relates to Vote 34. In summary, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage reallocated €446 million of 2021 voted funds from subheads where there was underspending to facilitate additional spending in other subheads. Public financial procedures state that the prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should always be obtained when a reallocation of voted funds is proposed. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage did not have the required prior approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for €314 million of the transfers during 2021. Subsequently, in July 2022, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provided formal sanction for the transfers. Included in the total reallocated was €310 million to increase the level of Vote funding for the Local Government Fund. This represented an increase of 79% over the Estimate provision amount approved by Dáil Éireann. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines indicate that the better approach to transferring the funding would have been to use the Supplementary Estimate process. Members will recall from last week that I introduced chapter 7, the Housing Agency's revolving acquisitions fund. The money in the fund originated from Vote 34. In brief, our examination found that, even by the revised target date of the end of 2021, there was a significant shortfall in the delivery of residential units through the fund. The examination also found that at the end of 2021, the cash balance of the acquisitions fund was €37.7 million, representing around half of the total fund value. This is indicative of under-utilisation of the fund's resources.

I call on Mr. Doyle to make his opening statement. It was indicated in the letter of invitation that it is limited to five minutes. We know who is present with him. We want a short summary.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	4	Of course, Chairman. I am pleased to be here to discuss the various areas that you have outlined. You have already introduced my colleagues. We look forward to discussing the expenditure and activity of the Department in 2021 with the committee. I will not go through every area of expenditure across our very broad remit, but I will touch on some key areas briefly. I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting, including briefing on the value-for-money Standing Order 218, along with a copy of my opening statement. I will start by welcoming the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the engagement of his team with the Department over the course of the audit. On the basis of recommendations, we will continue to evolve and mature our systems and reporting in line with best practice. The Department's gross expenditure in 2021, as set out in the Appropriation Account, totalled more than €5.1 billion. This was 2% below the outturn for 2020, due mainly to more targeted Covid-19 support payments to the local government sector in 2021 versus a higher amount in 2020. The year 2020 was a very challenging one for Ireland, and while at the outset of 2021 we were initially optimistic for a return to pre-pandemic activity and expenditure, 2021 in fact was an even more challenging year on many fronts. As we contended with the continued reality of Covid-19, the pace of delivery anticipated at the outset was simply not possible. Construction closures, social distancing measures, workforce impacts and supply chain issues had a significant impact on delivery and consequently on expenditure. However, that did not mean that areas of work stopped. The Department continued to work in delivering emergency legislation, ensuring that vulnerable households were protected, delivering cross-government supports and in preparing the new Housing for All strategy, which was published in September 2021. Housing for All was launched by the Government in September 2021. It has the objective that every citizen in the State should have access to good quality homes, to purchase or rent at an affordable price and built to a high standard and in the right place and offering good quality of life. This is a whole-of-government plan involving leadership and close collaboration across many Departments. In support of Housing for All, the Department's gross voted expenditure on housing programmes was approximately €2.8 billion in 2021, with additional funding available through the local property tax. Social housing represents a large proportion of expenditure under the housing programme, both for existing social homes and adding new social housing stock. New social housing is achieved under the main headings of build, acquisition and leasing. Rental supports under the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, are also provided. A broad range of services are provided including services for homeless households, supports for older people and people with a disability, Traveller accommodation, energy efficiency retrofits, pyrite and defective concrete block remediation. In terms of affordable housing, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 established the basis for new affordable purchase and cost-rental schemes, which commenced in 2022. Despite the very challenging impact of Covid-19 on construction activity, the second half of 2021 saw some rebound with local authorities, approved housing bodies and other delivery partners seeking to make up lost ground. A total of 9,169 new social homes were provided in 2021, and almost 5,196 of these were new-build homes delivered through local authorities and approved housing bodies. Some 1,262 were targeted acquisitions by local authorities and approved housing bodies and 2,711 homes under leasing programmes. The challenges of 2021 have given way to further challenges in the construction sector with very high levels of inflation, supply chain issues and in particular, higher interest rates across 2022. However, the Department remains focused on seeking to bring about new supply of social and affordable homes under the ambition set in Housing for All. Water services continue to undergo a significant period of reform in the approach to the delivery of water services and the promotion of wider environmental protection. Irish Water is now a stand-alone company in public ownership as a regulated utility. The Government's voted Exchequer investment in Uisce Éireann as it is now known, is substantial, and has been growing steadily in recent years, supported now with the revised NDP to bring certainty of investment in the years ahead. Almost €1.3 billion was spent by Uisce Éireann in 2021 to service existing schemes and deliver new water infrastructure and investment. This investment is vital to: maintain and enhance water services; safeguard public health; and ensure compliance by treating wastewater. While Uisce Éireann was focused on its capital programme in 2021 and again in 2022, there are significant infrastructure deficits to be addressed. The Government has committed to a high level of investment under the national development plan, NDP. In terms of the rural water programme, in 2021 some €48 million was provided across both capital and current funding structures. Certainty for priority investment has been put in place through a multi-annual capital programme, aimed at improving the reliability and efficiency of rural water services infrastructure. On local government, as chapter 6 shows, transfers of funding from central government sources to local authorities totalled some €5.8 billion in 2021. While funding is significantly up since 2016; this was a decrease of 5% from the 2020 level. Again, that was mainly due to changes in the level of Government supports. As the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated, a number of Departments, including our own, and the Department of Transport, provide this funding to local authorities. The Local Government Fund, LGF, is a special Central Fund, which was established under the Local Government Act 1998. The profile of income and expenditure of the Local Government Fund has undergone significant changes in recent years. Income for the fund comes from the Exchequer and local property tax. I have outlined some of the main payments so I will skip that in the interests of time. Further areas of expenditure in the 2021 Appropriation Account include: in the planning area, provision for the costs of An Bord Pleanála, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the Office of the Planning Regulator, amounting collectively to €37 million, as well as provision for the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, foreshore and marine spatial planning; Met Éireann costs; and heritage expenditure across a wide range of activities. In conclusion, 2021 and 2022 brought challenges to which the Department and our partners have had to respond. We are very much looking forward to adapting to these challenges, and to strive to achieve ambitious targets in place across our very broad remit this year and into the future. I note the ongoing co-operation by all stakeholders involved in the delivery of a work programme of the scale undertaken by the Department. The Department, its agencies and our partners for delivery, including the non-governmental organisations, NGO, and approved housing bodies, AHB, sectors, continue to focus on achieving the best for citizens. I look forward to engaging with the committee this morning and to providing as much information as possible. We are very happy to come back to the committee to provide anything further that is required.

It is very much appreciated. I will start by focusing first on previous recommendations made to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage by this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Our previous engagement was in June 2022. I will start with the proposition the committee made on improving value for money in expenditure year-on-year on social housing schemes - HAP, RAS, the social housing current expenditure programme, SHCEP, with the focus being on increasing capital expenditure on housing stock.I ask Mr. Doyle to provide an update on those recommendations. What has the Department done in response?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	7	This committee has repeatedly highlighted the level of spend on programmes such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. The focus in Housing for All is to provide new social homes through our capital programmes, in particular, to reduce the reliance on those schemes over time. Those schemes have been necessary due to the time needed to ramp up those capital spending programmes, particularly on social housing. That is the main activity we are focused on and Housing for All is focused on that. We brought about a number of ways to keep the pressure on ourselves and our delivery partners to keep delivering new-build social housing in particular to reduce reliance on those schemes over time.

What actions have been undertaken? Let us take HAP and RAS, for instance. How many households are under HAP and how many RAS properties are currently occupied?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	9	There are just over 59,000 tenancies in HAP. That is down a little from just over 61,000. The 2021 number for RAS was slightly lower than the 2020 number with 17,183 active tenancies at the end of the year. That would have been almost 16,600 at the end of last year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	11	In 2021 it would have been just under €542 million and it was slightly down on that in 2022 at €539 million.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	13	If I go back to 2020 it was €133 million, in 2021 it was €122 million and it went down a little bit to €114 million in 2022.

The Comptroller and Auditor General issued recommendations back in 2020 under his examination of the oversight of HAP. What has the Department implemented in terms of reform of the HAP system?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	15	There has been a positive response to all of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations. The chief response in that regard has been the establishment of a HAP oversight committee within the Department, which met five times last year and once at the end of the previous year. It examines all aspects of HAP, including value for money, the detailed operation of the scheme, and the processes and procedures under it. There has been some increased desktop checking and oversight of the scheme. We are moving to some on-site checking as well this year so there has been significant focus on it, which the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation has helped bring to bear.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	16	The concern is that the HAP scheme was introduced back in 2014 to replace the RAS system. However, the level of expenditure for RAS remains relatively current. What measures is the Department taking to move people off HAP and into RAS properties?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	17	That is often said and it is described in a number of places. RAS was to take people away from rent supplement, paid through the Department of Social Protection. Those who had been on rent supplement for a long period of time moved into RAS properties. HAP is a separate scheme, which is about the support of the rent that tenants pay under that scheme. We have seen a gradual decline in RAS expenditure and we are seeing a slow decline in HAP expenditure as well.

How does the Department monitor them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	23	There are a number of metrics around HAP to allow the expenditure to be monitored and projected forward. There is heavy oversight and governance around HAP.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	27	We have repeatedly had discussions about it being a current expenditure support. We really want to try to move people to social housing in the case of HAP tenants. That is the main overall concern on value for money.

The completion of a lot of these projects has taken place in the last quarter of 2022. We tried to bring about a situation where that could be spread a little bit over the course of the year. Due to the issues that happened in 2022 with inflation, retendering of projects and supply chains, the profile of expenditure got worse in 2022 in terms of a huge amount of it being back-ended to the end of the year and a lot of delivery being in December. For example-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	47	It is new builds by local authorities and AHBs.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	49	We radically reduced the target under acquisitions for last year, to 200.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	51	For acquisitions, yes. That was mainly to target certain types of housing, either for large families or for specialised housing in some cases. That was to put a significant amount of focus on the build programme. With the challenges last year, particularly in respect of homelessness, and the decision to put a pause on evictions, it was decided to encourage local authorities to purchase properties where there was a risk of a person becoming homeless as a landlord was exiting the market. Sorry, the answer is that number will be significantly higher than 200, ranging from 500 to 700, because a lot of that activity was in December and there is a great deal of conveyancing going on.

The figures in the accounts provide for a cost per unit under the two PPP bundles. It estimates a cost of approximately €633,000 per unit. I ask Mr. Doyle to provide a breakdown of the cost per unit, including the business and maintenance costs, that has been recorded in the accounts.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	53	That is sort of a whole-of-life unitary cost. It is worked through by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, when it brings forward these schemes. I do not have a breakdown. It is a life cycle cost over the lifetime of the unit. It includes construction, maintenance, operating costs, tenancy management, financing costs and so on. We are happy to get that breakdown and provide it to the Deputy.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	55	At the end of the period, it will revert to the relevant local authority, which will then have the use of the unit for social housing purposes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	59	They are in Dublin, Kildare, Sligo and Wicklow. There are 73 in Kildare, 63 in Sligo and 106 in Wicklow. There are three Dublin-based projects, with 68 units in East Wall, 93 in Ballymun, including senior citizens units, and 83 on Collins Avenue, Dublin 9. That is the breakdown.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	61	Yes. There is a bundle of four, which is 1,600 units, and a bundle of five, which is 600 units, if I am correct. Sorry, the bundles of four and five together would be 1,600 units and a bundle of six would be 600 units.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	63	It is very much subject to contract costs, but our budget for PPPs in 2023 is €30 million. Just in terms of the way the payments fall, we paid €36 million for PPPs in 2021 and €62 million in 2022. It is just the profile of when the payments fall.

To refer back to the opening statement of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he issued a clear audit opinion for the 2021 accounts but drew attention to:... a note in the account that discloses payment of a fine to the European Commission arising from a judgement [relating to Derrybrien in Galway] of the European Court of Justice in November 2019. The case concerned Ireland’s failure to ensure that a retrospective environmental impact assessment was carried out in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway. The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that a lump sum of €5 million was paid in 2020, plus a daily fine of €15,000 and legal costs. At the outset, €15,000 per day is a phenomenal amount of money to be paying. I note the 2022 figures are not included here but I am sure the witnesses have them to hand. To date, how much has been spent on this fine? I ask the witnesses to leave out legal costs for now. We will take that as included. I suspect it is approximately €22 million, or in excess thereof. I ask the witnesses to clarify the position in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	65	To date, just under €16 million has been paid out. It is €15.98 million. Across the years, between the lump sum, it was €2.7 million in 2020, it was approximately €5.5 million in 2021 and last year it was just under €2.8 million. The judgment essentially required the owner and operator of the wind farm, which is the ESB in this instance, to submit an application for a retrospective environmental impact assessment, EIA, known as a substitute consent, to An Bord Pleanála. It submitted that application. An Bord Pleanála eventually found against it and at that point it ceased operation of the wind farm. Our colleagues at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications have engaged with the Commission on this issue, seeking to close the fines that have been paid through our Department. Our understanding is that we are due to receive a decision on that. We are hopeful for a positive decision in terms of it being closed at that point. We expect to receive a decision, which is a matter for the Commission, within a matter of days.

What is the figure for the legal costs from 2019 to date?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	67	I see a reference to legal costs but I was not aware there were legal costs in it. I understood it to be just the fines but I have seen a reference to legal costs. I may need to check that, unless my colleague, Mr. Hogan, has further information. I did not understand there to be legal costs in it. The main element was-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	71	Certainly.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	74	We will find out if there are legal costs, yes.

#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	76	I thank the Chairman. In terms of the conclusion to this, is there-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	77	On a general point on these European cases, they are between member states and the Commission. It is a general finding that legal costs will be incurred and it usually relates to the state's cost in meeting the case against the Commission, which would not be hugely significant in terms of the overall figure. We can get clarification.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	78	We will get clarification.

That would be helpful. I thank the witnesses.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	80	I point out for the sake of completeness that up to the date the decision was made and the wind farm stopped operating, there will be a further fine that has not yet been paid.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	81	That is a lump sum.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	82	No, it will be just to cover the period in the same run as the previous ones. My understanding is that will be another €1.2 million if the outcome of the case is that the fines are closed off on that date.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	83	In terms of the conclusion to it, Mr. Doyle referred to a retrospective environmental assessment. Does the Department have a timeframe for when this might be finished, including the daily fines and all the associated costs?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	84	The argument that has been made to the Commission is that the fines stop from the point at which the facility stopped operating or at which the finding was made. That would be the final €1.2 million payment at that point. That is the proposal, and that is the argument that has been made to the Commission. We will see what its decision is in the coming period.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	85	I have just four minutes left so I ask Mr Doyle to be brief in his responses. With regard to Uisce Éireann and all the reforms that have taken place there, I am a little taken aback with regard to the separation of the entity itself. It is stated that this will take effect this year, but that is unlikely. The Committee of Public Accounts will obviously have a role in questioning Uisce Éireann on its operations, but that is not likely to happen until 2024. Why will it take so long? If the entity has been established and reformed, why is it taking so long for it to become accountable to this committee?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	86	My understanding is that from the point that it has now reached in terms of the full separation, which happened at the start of the year, the Comptroller and Auditor General will now audit the accounts and Uisce Éireann will be-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	88	If 2023 is its first year of operation that I audit, it will be next year before I have an audit opinion and a set of financial statements that would come before the committee. We can look at that retrospectively.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	89	We will monitor the situation. I want to turn to the local property tax. There have obviously been changes to the bands in the last year or so. In terms of the amounts collected, has the Department seen a drop-off in the payments being made by householders in local property tax globally across the country or have more people availed of the monthly payment scheme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	90	I will defer to Ms O'Gorman on that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	91	The collection of property tax is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. The Department just deals with the allocation of the local property tax funds collected that are transferred into the Local Government Fund. The Revenue Commissioners publish quarterly statistics on their website with regard to collection and yield information.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	92	It is the Revenue Commissioners who ultimately obtain all of that information. That clarifies the position. The staffing complement of the Department was 1,207 in 2020. This increased by 159, to 1,366, in 2021. What kind of grades and areas have the new staff been deployed in? Are they at administrative officer or principal officer, PO, level or above?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	93	It is probably in the middle grades more than anywhere else. There are a number of things happening. Obviously, the heritage function joining the Department brings in a lot of different people across the country. There are in excess of 600 staff across all of those functions, for example, in the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the rangers, and there are many different grades involved. There was that, and there was additional resourcing being applied into all areas of the Department in recent years.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	94	However, the 159 are brand-new staff.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	95	Yes, some of them are brand-new staff and they would be across a range of grades. There has been one senior post at assistant secretary level and a couple at PO level, but most of them would be in the middle grades.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	96	The Department might forward a note to the committee with a breakdown of that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	97	Absolutely.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	98	Since I am on the topic of staffing, there was a story in the Sunday newspapers relating to the Secretary General. There was quite extensive coverage about an issue involving him being in negotiations in respect of his salary. Is there any way he can shed light on that issue here?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	99	Yes, I will. I appreciate that the story was on the front page of a Sunday newspaper. I also appreciate that those matters, which have been under discussion for a number of years, were the subject of that media coverage. HR issues are dealt with by Departments, and I am sure any issues relating my terms and conditions will be clarified in due course through engagement with those Departments. In terms of public sector salaries generally, including my own, they are very much a matter of public record. If there was any change to my terms and conditions, it would also be clear in the context of it being a matter of record. Beyond that, any HR discussion - and, as stated, there are some discussions that date back a number of years - are very much dealt with by the relevant Departments.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	105	I think there was mention of a legal action. There is not a legal action.

What are the actual targets?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	108	The commission has looked at the issue of targets. Its work in that regard is ongoing. There is some mention of that matter in the newspaper this morning. There is a lot of debate about what the targets should be, and we have based them on the work with the ESRI and the housing demand needs assessment. The figure of 33,000 that gets mentioned all of the time is an average. That increases over time. Depending on the assumptions one applies, one can end up with very different targets, so there has been a lot of discussion about those issues. We will need to look at the targets again with the detailed census report and the work that we get back from bodies such as the Housing Commission.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	110	We have to keep them under review in order to prevent them from being inadequate. We have to strive to get to a point whereby the construction industry can reach them overall and we can reach them through the social programmes that we have.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	111	The point I am making is that, for several years, members of this committee and others have been saying it is their belief that the housing targets have been understated in terms of what is actually required, and the Department has disputed that. Mr. Doyle is now saying that the Department is reviewing that. When will that review be completed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	112	We will always continue to review the targets, and that happens. I will bring in my colleague, Mr. Hogan, who is the expert in this area.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	113	We have work under way to review the national planning framework and, in doing that, to look at the targets. The targets are monitored on a regular basis and we get quarterly statistics from the CSO, so the projection that was set out by the ESRI, on which the housing targets were based, was largely accurate up to March of this year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	115	My apologies, it was March of last year. We have obviously experienced a very significant migration shock in terms of population since then. Having said that, the under-provision means that the average does get added to as time goes on, so there is a higher figure when we look at an average for the years ahead, and that is needed.Obviously, it has pushed up beyond the 33,000 as a result of that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	117	No, I am not saying that. Within-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	119	No set of housing targets could have accounted for that level of shock. That is the first thing. The second thing I am saying is that in the vast majority of local authority areas there is a huge gap to be made up in terms of meeting the target. There is no question of the target being inadequate. The pressure arises in the counties around Dublin and on the eastern seaboard. That is an issue for regional development in Ireland. That regional balance aspect also needs to be factored into the review of any targets.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	120	All I have is the report in The Irish Times, which indicates that with population growth at the upper end of official projections the figure quoted even excludes recent arrivals from Ukraine. Does Mr. Hogan accept that prior to March, in fact for some years, our targets have been below what is actually required?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	121	I would say that in the context of the regional imbalance, yes, because clearly there is more demand arising in the counties around Dublin.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	122	I was asking about the holistic figures. I see that the new Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform received a briefing from his officials which showed the capital underspend in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage at €1 billion. Does Mr. Doyle dispute that figure of €1 billion for 2022?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	123	No. In the capital underspend, we have carried forward about €340 million on a capital carryover for 2022.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	124	Where did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform figure of €1 billion come from?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	125	I think that was based on a figure at November 2022 where a lot of the spend actually occurred in November and December of the year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	127	As a carryover.

It is money that was allocated for last year but was not spent. How can Mr. Doyle possibly justify that situation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	129	A lot of it has come through the situation. I answered Deputy Dillon's question in relation to the delivery of social housing, for example, and the challenges around that.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	130	We missed our targets by 28% in social housing output. Would that be the correct figure?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	131	I do not believe that is the case. In terms of the figure I gave, I suppose the original target being 9,000 revised to 8,000 given what was going on and I believe we would be relatively close to that.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	132	Of the 9,000 is it correct that 6,500 were completed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	133	I know that has been the figure that has been put out based on an estimate in a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform briefing to its Minister that the Deputy has referred to. I responded to Deputy Dillon earlier to say that based on what we see - we are still doing the counting and verification - we see something closer to 8,000, somewhere in the 7,500 to 8,000 range.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	135	Completions in 2022.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	137	I have to put a caveat on that because of the extent of delivery at the end of the year.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	138	The figure I have for affordable housing is 900 does Mr. Doyle dispute that figure?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	139	Again, we are trying to verify where we got to at the end of the year in terms of all delivery methods and the Minister will make an announcement of where that is once we are solid on those numbers.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	140	The numbers for affordable housing are so low that someone could nearly go around the country and count them if they were so minded. Surely Mr. Doyle has a ballpark figure. Is the 900 which has been mentioned in an official document that has been presented to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform way off kilter or is it in that ballpark?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	141	There are so many different schemes and we have so many different delivery mechanisms across the affordable piece that I find it hard to come up with a particular composite figure. What has happened on the affordable side is that we have worked very hard to bring about a number of new schemes delivered from a number of different delivery partners around-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	143	The Minister will give a number on that once that number is available.

Will there be 29,000 completions this year? That is what the target for 2023 is. Will that be met?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	145	The target for 2022 appears to be well exceeded overall at that level. It is-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	147	There are a number of sources of information - the Deputy will have read them just as I have - including the Central Bank and others. There are challenges and headwinds in the sector. We are very hopeful that it will be met and I know that we are trying to make changes where we can to try to help overall delivery get to that number.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	148	However, we are in 2023 now. There is a target. Mr. Doyle is the Secretary General of the Department with responsibility for this area. The target is 29,000. Does he believe that target will be reached?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	149	The 29,000 is an industry target. It is for Ireland as a whole in terms of all forms of construction. We are very hopeful that target will be achieved this year, but there are undoubtedly challenges out there in the market, as we have all seen.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	150	Last week representatives of the Housing Agency appeared before the committee. I asked them a number of questions on the Croí Cónaithe programme in cities. Bizarrely, they felt they were not in a position to tell us how many applications there had been for that scheme. They told us we should ask Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage officials. I am taking the opportunity to see if Mr. Doyle can tell us how many applications have been received or are on hand for that scheme and where they are located.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	151	Certainly, I will give the Deputy that information now. Our colleagues last week were working on the basis that there was an awful lot of commercial and confidential work and we had not released figures previously. I think they were in a difficult position vis-à-vis ourselves last week. I am very happy to give the Deputy the information now. At stage 1, there were 26 proposals by 16 different entities. That was just over 3,800 units. Seven of those were ineligible. At stage 2, that 26 was back to 19. One was withdrawn so the number of units under consideration at that stage was 2,442, to give an exact number. At stage 3, having assessed those proposals, there are 15 live proposals, three withdrawn. At that point, 2,102 units-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	153	That would be 15 proposals - 15 schemes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	155	That is after the three were withdrawn.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	157	It is 15 live proposals for 2,102 units under the process to fund under Croí Cónaithe. That is the first call under Croí Cónaithe. There will be another one this year and further ones. Croí Cónaithe was to seek to deliver 5,000 units over the next number of years. I apologise to the Deputy that he did not get that information last week, but that was why.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	162	I came into the Department two and a half years ago.

We have an underspend in the Department, if Mr. Doyle's figures are correct, of €451 million. It will be carrying it through to 2022, just €247 million. We also read today in the newspapers that 28%, more than a quarter, of the grants of permission will not be commenced. What is the problem?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	164	There are a lot of issues going on out there in the market. We have seen rampant inflation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	166	I suppose my biggest concern right now in terms of housing output and deliveries across the system is interest rates rising. I think that creates a lot of concern. There is risk aversion out there in the industry. Of all the challenges that get mentioned, I think that is probably the biggest challenge that is out there now. We have talked about inflation and we have talked about supply chains. Some of that is settling, albeit at a higher level.

We can come back to that. There is a very detailed report in The Journal today that said that the cost of building a two-bed, medium-rise suburban apartment is now €240,000. Would Mr. Doyle agree with that figure? That figure is ex-site costs and just the building. Would he agree with that figure?

It is €140,000. That is €100,000 less. That is at the top end. It is €140,000 for a two-bed house versus €240,000 for a two-bed apartment. What is the issue there?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	198	The Deputy has just quoted them, saying that it is not part of what they consider and look at. They look at density, overall planning guidelines, spatial strategies, etc.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	199	Mr. Doyle mentioned density. Our planning policy is for high density, which means that the typologies we get from our planning policy are for apartments or terraced housing. We do not get three-bed semis and we do not get two-bed housing with front and back gardens, which is what people want. Instead, we are spending the taxpayers' money on what they do not want. However, because the developer cannot build them viably, Mr. Doyle spends the taxpayers' money buying them. Earlier, I heard Mr. Doyle say that some 9,000 units of social housing is being provided. More than 5,000 of them were apartments. Regarding that 5,000, the deferential in money to the taxpayer that would have provided two-bed houses is €1 billion and maybe more. We would have actually gotten more than 6,000 two-bed houses with front and back gardens that will not become ghettos in the future. Would the Secretary General call that value for money?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	202	It is not a binary question.

It requires a "Yes" or "No" answer. Is it value for money to waste €1 billion of the taxpayers' money when we know that viability is the issue? We just cannot meet targets and we never will because the policy is not changing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	204	There will be issues around value for money if there is a service, for example, urban sprawl, if we have to try to bring transport-----

We do not have the transport infrastructure anywhere, except in Dublin, to cater for apartment building and living. Would Mr. Doyle agree with that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	206	The main provision of public transport is certainly in Dublin.

It is therefore not appropriate that our planning policy would dictate the same high density for towns in Wexford and Waterford. Urban high densities do not suit the rest of country. Do they? Is that not why we are not meeting our targets? Is that not why our building and planning permissions are not commencing? They are just not viable. Mr. Doyle was telling Deputy Carthy there that he hopes to meet them next year. Can he tell me in one sentence what has changed this year? Last year, he could not meet his targets and he is saying that he is going to meet them next year. What has changed?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	210	What changed? I am sorry, but I do not understand the Deputy.

What are they buying? They are buying the apartments. Are they not? That is social or whatever. They are spending €240,000 per apartment, excluding site costs. It is an abomination if we include the site costs and ancillaries, because the apartment will then cost €460,000. Who else can buy it? Who else is buying these apartments?

In his capacity as Secretary General, what advice has he given the Government to tackle the viability issue, which is the biggest issue we are seeing today, is it not?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	216	The viability issue around apartments is an exceptionally big issue, but we need apartments and we certainly need them in key areas.

Section 15 of the Act states that local government must ensure that the county development plan objectives are delivered. Does it not?

Let me tell him that the planning policy, which is coming from national planning policy, is preventing them from doing that. Mr. Doyle is talking about targets. Clearly, he does not understand what the problem is, even though he has told me what the problem is. Seemingly, he has no clue about how to fix it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	251	Yes, but they are largely treated the same way. I can get the Deputy a separation of them.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	253	That is no problem. There were 7,855 active leases at the end of last year.

It is the enhanced leasing figure I am looking for. I had a number last week that I was wrong about in respect of County Kildare. The number is 681 and I just wanted to correct that. When I first raised the enhanced leasing scheme in the Dáil in 2021, the then Taoiseach, Mícheál Martin, told me that no local authority should be on both sides of this and it would be phased out. If anything, I am seeing it being scaled up rather than phased out in my own area. It is incredibly poor value for money. What investors say is that "a further benefit of the leasing option is the investment opportunities for international and domestic private investors". CBRE, which is one of the biggest real estate companies in the world, has recently reported that "investors are keen to acquire residential units and schemes let by local authorities on a long-term lease". Another group now sees social housing as a financial product under the long-term leasing scheme. It is incredibly bad value for money. New houses acquired have to be within a group of 30 or more. They are leased for in the region of 25 years, at up to 95% of the market rent with a four-yearly review. The average per annum figure, according to replies to parliamentary questions is €17,000 per unit, which works out at €425,000 over 25 years. It is then refurbished, returned to the investor and then the housing need has to be met all over again. Essentially, a mortgage is being paid without having an asset at the end of it. That is incredibly bad value for money. The committee is interested in value for money. We need a briefing note on the enhanced leasing scheme.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	255	I have the answer to the figure requested by the Deputy. From 2018 to quarter 3 of 2022, it is 410 enhanced leases out of the overall leasing programme.

We are finding it impossible to get an overview. I am not going to sit down and ring 30 local authorities and ask them individually. The Department needs to be able to give us those figures. On new builds, I have raised the importance of language with departmental officials on several occasions when they have been before the committee. Language is important. New build and direct build are two different things. What is happening with the new builds coming in is that they are being bought on a turnkey basis. They are not designed by the local authority. They go through the process as a normal housing planning application. They are approved, built and then the local authority may buy the whole estate or part of it. They are included in the new build numbers. How many were directly built by local authorities or AHBs last year and the year before?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	261	My colleague will give the Deputy some delivery figures. Many of the turnkeys that we are approving at this point in time would not otherwise be delivered unless they were through the social housing programme. It allows us to deliver housing into the social housing programme housing that would not otherwise delivered.

We were told that the situation is being looked at. There are three tiers to AHBs. Bigger ones tend to be professionally managed while the smaller ones are often managed by volunteers. Typically, the local authority provides the land, the State provides the capital to build and a maintenance amount is allocated to the AHBs of the mortgage. Once the mortgage is redeemed, the ownership reverts to the AHB, so they are in private ownership. AHBs are managed under the Charities Regulator, but they could change from being a charity, or a company limited by guarantee. The Department had stated it was looking at a particular situation, and established an unencumbered units working group. That relates to the approved housing bodies that no longer have a mortgage. Where is that at? What are the terms of reference? How many units are involved in that particular working group?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	265	On the general point we have seen a number of the smaller approved housing body units taken over by other AHBs.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	266	I just asked about the terms of reference for that working group and what the number is. I have very little time.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	267	They are looking at how many of these units will become unencumbered over the coming years. While there is still a bit to run on some of those schemes, a small number is starting to come out of some older schemes.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	268	Can he come back to us and provide the full terms of reference to the committee?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	269	We will give the full terms of reference to the committee.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	270	There is a real concern here. Another issue raised at last week's meeting, and not for the first time, is that when a local authority builds a house the money is provided by the Department. They build the house. There is differential rent. People pay rent and if the person moves out, somebody else tenants that house. It is up to the local authority to maintain it. With an approved housing body, they get the money from the Department and build the housing. However, we are hearing that some of the AHBs that no longer have a mortgage will allocate the scheme. They will be given a list from the local authority in some cases while, in others, they bypass the local authority, but the local authority will then do a rental accommodation scheme, RAS, with them for the tenancies. The State has built the houses and then it will subsidise the rent even though there is not a mortgage. Where is the value for money in that? Who designed that? Who is the beneficial owner of these houses built by the AHBs after the mortgage?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	271	Once the AHBs has paid back the loans given by the State, they are then the beneficial owner of the property. They will then use them under their articles of association and under the charities regulation for social housing purposes. In cases where a maintenance payment is paid, it is often to some of those schemes that were for very vulnerable people in the past. The payment is quite low. It is around the maintenance of the property for social housing.

I have a few different matters I want to get to today. I will draw the officials' attention back to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and Vote 34 in the area of the reallocation of voted funds from 2021. As set out in that report, there was €314 million in 2021 that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did not approve for reallocation but the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage moved ahead anyway. It is outlined in the report that the normal way to transfer the funding is to use the Supplementary Estimate process. Why was that not used?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	284	This was the transfer of funds in respect of providing for the rates waiver with local authorities. That was done outside of the normal expenditure process.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	294	I think that in discussions between ourselves and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform this was the way that the transfer was done, but it was signed off at Cabinet level.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	308	Certainly, no problem at all. As the Deputy outlined, there are two ways to move funds from one pot to another, as she put it. It can either be done through virement or a technical Supplementary Estimate. We need to look at the instance referenced by the Deputy in the context of the substantial savings due to Covid-19. Mr. Doyle outlined that a lot of the capital savings had arisen because of the construction shutdown. In that instance, it was a judgment call between ourselves and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that the money could be moved via virement rather than a technical Supplementary Estimate.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	316	That a virement might have happened.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	324	Yes. A briefing was also provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to the Oireachtas committee on housing that outlined the other Supplementary Estimates taken at that time.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	325	Okay. Is Ms Costello happy with that way of proceeding with €314 million? Was she happy with that process? Does she think that provides enough oversight of that reallocation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	326	I think it was a judgment call. We obviously try not to encourage Supplementary Estimates.

We know Supplementary Estimates come before committees all the time - I sit on many of them. I am asking whether the Department intends to continue with a process whereby it eschews the Supplementary Estimates process and goes to that virement process for substantial amounts.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	330	As I said, there was an incredible context that we need to acknowledge.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	332	Absolutely, it does.

I am asking officials from both Departments whether there is an intent to continue this way in respect of this level of funds. It seems - I will not use the word "evasion" - the Departments are eschewing public oversight.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	334	That never would have been the intention.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	337	I hope that is not the case but that certainly was not the intention.

I want to pick up a little on the AHBs issue. We had a long discussion last week of the process whereby we will not own the asset towards the end of the process in respect of AHBs. We also talked about the level of public oversight in AHBs' decision-making. Representatives from the Housing Agency described to us that there will be an AHB group in every local authority. Will the officials very quickly outline what that involves? This group will make decisions around what type of housing AHBs are required to provide.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	343	It is an AHB forum. It includes representatives of the local authorities and the AHBs.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	345	No. It is the housing team. This is typically the housing director and members of the team involved in housing delivery.

Is it meaningful that we make those decisions around provision? I am particularly interested in the provision of homes for people who have different needs and abilities in respect of disability. Once the mortgage is paid off and there is no lien on the property, what is the mechanism whereby the State will ensure that the AHBs still operate and provide those homes to those particular groups? It does not seem there is any mechanism. I do not see that all that work we will have done on the forum will be meaningful or significant in decision-making in 25 years. That is the first question. I have a second question.We obviously have a CPO mechanism for derelict and dangerous sites. We have two mechanisms under legislation. There is a move to increase the number of CPOs so that we can utilise our vacant properties and this is to be commended. I am also aware that often local authorities decide it is not cost-effective to bring the CPO properties into social housing and they may in fact put them on the private market. What level of information does the Department have on this? Does it give guidelines to local authorities on what the possible turnaround is? Should local authorities be turning them around at all rather than putting them back in the social system?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	360	We said we would come back to the committee with the terms of reference of the departmental group which is looking at unencumbered houses. It is looking at some of the questions that committee members are asking. It is important to note these are charitable bodies and the assets cannot be disposed of. They cannot be privatised.

This is what we are looking at. We will come back to the committee.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	366	We are very happy that we have set up a good programme of work on vacancy. We will publish a vacancy action plan next week. Much of the detail the Deputy might be looking for will be in this. We have signalled in Housing for All that we will have a CPO programme for local authorities. In some cases they will CPO for social housing. This is generally when a house is in a particular location that suits for social housing, there is particular demand for it and the service is appropriate. A lot of derelict houses are not in such locations and we also need to see what we can do with them. We are keen to bring them forward. There will be a CPO programme for these houses also and they will be for sale on the private market where appropriate. We are developing guidance with the Housing Agency and we hope to get it out-----

When this happens, will the funding received from the Central Fund, the Housing Finance Agency or wherever it comes from return to the housing sector or will it to go to local authority when it sells it on the private market?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	368	Bridging funding is available, as the Deputy said, from the Housing Finance Agency where needed. What will happen is that once local authorities sell the houses into the private market that money is taken and used for another CPO process. The idea is that the money revolves-----

The Derelict Sites Act allows local authorities to make the purchase in the first place. All they are doing is defraying money they have spent once the purchase occurs.

Would it not dawn on anyone to consider this in respect of the approved housing bodies forum? Is the job of that particular committee just to rubber-stamp what is put in front of it? We teased this out last week with the Housing Agency and we are doing so again this morning. I am a former local government representative, as are many committee members. I am taken aback at the amount of serious decision-making that completely bypasses the elected members. I remind the witnesses that the legal council is the elected members. I do not want to personalise this but we have the Department and the county managers who are the chief executives. My last county council meeting was 12 years ago this week. Since that time there has been an amount of bypassing the legal council of the elected members, never mind what I saw during my terms on the council. Here is another example of it. The elected members are the decision-makers on the housing strategic policy committee of the council. Forum after forum is set up with no consideration given to the views of members. Members are not included. However the people who face the music and face the public, as the Deputies here know, are the politicians. It is nearly worse for councillors because they are local. They are the people who answer the questions.

I will say in a general way, and not just with regard to housing, we are dealing with local authorities and there are 31 of them in the State. I ask the Department to remember that the 31 chambers are the legal councils. The rest are employees employed by the elected members. It is the same with the chief executive officers. Their terms have to be renewed every seven years.

Language is important. The phrase "local authorities" has been used. Most of the public hear that in an entirely different way. They hear it as meaning the people they elected to represent them. This is not who we are talking about here. Really it underpins, if anything, that we do not have a local government system. We have a local system of administration where the power really resides. It really does underpin this when "local authorities" is said without differentiating that it is at official level and not at local authority level.

It is not for this meeting but I can give example after example of local councillors being asked how something happened and whose idea it was when there was a greater need for the money to be spent elsewhere. The local authority members say they do not know and they have no control over it. They say the money came from a Department to the chief executive officer who decided where it would go. That is it. We are undermining the basis of democracy. The most important piece of democracy is local government. It is the closest to the people. We have pulled it asunder in this country. It is a bigger issue but I could not help intervening as Deputy Hourigan was raising these issues. It came to mind.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	389	I do not disagree for a second with any of what the Chair has said. One of the most important functions of the elected members is to approve the budget of the local authority and work on it through the committees. This is a key element.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	390	A lot of this bypasses the budget because it is direct money. Councillors need to be in the frame. It is the same with housing, which is the biggest issue facing local authorities. Councillors need to be bought in to be part of it. I am a former chair of a strategic policy housing committee. People who elect local representatives expect them to have some hand, act or part in the decision-making. It is unfair and unworkable. We are destroying local democracy. That is all I want to say. We will take a break for ten minutes sharp and we will resume prior to 11.20 a.m.

Am I correct that there was a €1 billion underspend in housing in the past year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	392	That was based on the underspend at that point in the year. A lot of spend caught up at the end of the year. That has been quoted out of a document.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	394	Yes, it was in the brief.

It was based on a run rate. If the underspend continued at that level, the point being made was that it could result in an underspend of €1 billion. In fact, most of the delivery happens in that last quarter. This year, that got skewed a little bit more into December.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	404	No. The underspend across the Department, most of which is carried forward under the capital carryover, was approximately €500 million. I have the exact figure there somewhere.

For six years, one does not have to worry about it. My point is, it is a top-up finance. It is putting more debt on the property. If the value of the house is €300,000 and it is a 20% top-up, that is an extra €60,000. The Secretary General is saying to me that that is captured in this figure of 4,100.

This is revealing that the figure of loans for private houses where people are borrowing from private institutions is now being counted by the Department and by the Government in figures for affordable housing delivery.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	426	I suppose the shared equity scheme was a key part of the Government's policy around delivering more affordable homes or allowing people who would not otherwise be in the market to afford to get into the market.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	427	I understand that, but it should not be. What we are talking about here is new builds. That is our understanding, according to the briefing notes. We had the Housing Agency here last week. We follow this closely. I do not know whether other members are aware of it but this is the first time I heard it. That figure needs to be taken out of it. In relation to delivery, because this is a real crunch issue, I have raised with the Secretary General previously the issue of generic designs. Nobody, whether politician, official, architect, local government official or anyone else, has ever explained this to me. There is no reason we cannot have generic designs for one, two, three and four-bedroom houses, single storey for disabled people and two-storey for family apartments. We used to do this. We know it works because one can see the evidence of it all over the country in decades gone by. As I have told the Secretary General previously, this is not about lowering the standards to those of 1940 or anything like that. It is about building generic houses to the 2023 standards - A-rated houses. Instead of that, every local authority is starting with a blank canvas. One is paying architects' fees. I checked again this week. Architects' fees of between 8% and 12% of the overall cost are going on it. People in the sector believe that it is madness. I believe that it is worse than that. It is slowing down delivery because one has to get approval from the Department, back and forth, for design. I raised this and the Secretary General stated that he would look at this and come back to me. Why can we not have generic designs with which we can mass produce houses? I am not talking about low quality. I am not talking about what looks like the Soviet Union in 1940. I am not talking about any of that. I am talking about good-quality housing. I have given the Secretary General examples in the past of good quality housing that his Department approved - A-rated houses. Why can we not take that and replicate it across the country? Who is stopping it? Did the Secretary General raise this with the Minister, or who is stopping this?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	428	Nobody. It is not that people are stopping it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	430	The significant step that we have made recently around this is to bring out the new design manual that sets out a range depending on the site, depending on what the need is in the particular local authority area and what kind of mix of units they are trying to bring about. It sets out clearly for the local authority what the layouts of that house can be that will comply with what we will fund.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	432	Yes.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	433	I understand that the Department would have certain specifications. That is different from what I am talking about. What I am talking about is simple and straightforward, that we have a generic design, for instance, for a two-bedroom terrace house, that is most appropriate that can be used in Donegal, Kerry, Offaly or Laois, and that we have single-storey two-bedroom units for people with disabilities that can be used across the country. What I am asking the Secretary General is, why have we to go back to a blank canvas on every occasion? It is costing more. It is slowing down the process. Those are the two issues. We are discussing the cost of these projects and the speed at which we can get them delivered. We are in the middle of a crisis. I need not tell Mr. Doyle that. I am sure the officials are doing their best to deal with this. One of the big impediments are these issues and this is something that we can deal with. There is no reason a firm of architects will not design a generic model for us by looking at the best examples of what we have used to date, there are some brilliant examples, that can be replicated right across the State. A little like how, I understand, pop stars get a royalty every time their tune is played somewhere, every time 100 houses to the architects' design are being built in Donegal or wherever, they would get a limited, modest fee or royalty on it.Surely there is some way of doing this. We did it before, why can it not be done? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	434	We are doing it for the internal design that can be used - the design of the house. The outside of the house-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	436	If we were doing large fields of large numbers of social houses - we try to integrate social housing into the community for all kinds of very good reasons and we are committed that - and when these schemes are developed, they need to fit into a certain site profile and they need to fit in with what has been planned for the area. We have made very clear, to try to short-circuit that design process, what is acceptable, what is required, what meets the standards and what we will fund.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	437	With architects of fees of 12 %, that is nuts.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	438	We hope to reduce that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	439	The quickest way of reducing it is to have a generic design. Can I take Mr. Doyle up on the issue of fitting them in? I get that but it does not have to be huge estates like the ones in the south of the city that were built during the 1970s and 1980s.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	440	Sure.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	441	This can be done. A lot of these are infill developments and a generic model can be used for them. They can also be used on greenfield sites. This can be done; it is not rocket science. It has been done over and over again and with huge success in providing social housing in decades gone by. The one thing that drives me bonkers is that we seem to have every reason we cannot do what worked in the past. If it worked in the past, there is no reason we should not do it now. Can I ask Mr. Doyle about PPPs? Can he come back to the committee on this? Can he have a serious chat with those at the top in the Department around what is being proposed and tell me if it can be done, or why it cannot be done? Can we go a step further not just in terms of internal design?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	442	Our social housing guidelines encourage the use of the generic designs we have. We have not mandated it but the use of generic design is encouraged. What we are now trying to encourage much more of, particularly around the delivery of social housing, is the modern methods of construction such as offsite construction which speeds up delivery and will ultimately in the future bring down the cost. They are two things we are looking at at present.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	443	On costs and the PPPs, those first two bundles are coming in at €633,000 per unit. Some of those would be one-, two- and three-bedroom units. They would be small units. That is an absolutely astronomical sum. I know Mr. Doyle will say it is for the full lifespan over 25 years and that there is maintenance. However, from what I have seen, and I have checked, the maintenance in the local authorities works out at between one fifth and one eighth of what comes in in rent. That means the rent more than covers it. The rent is normally five to eight times higher than the actual maintenance costs for the local authority. I am puzzled as to where this figure of €633,000 per unit came from. I checked again yesterday to see the cost for local authorities. The all-in costs - it goes back to Deputy Verona Murphy's point - with site costs, architects fees and all of the other expenses - come to €250,000, or €290,000 for good-sized local authority housing. This figure is two and a half times that. Why is that?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	470	All of the PPPs to date have involved partnerships with AHBs which come in to manage the properties as part of the contract arrangements in place. The AHB will manage those properties on behalf of the local authorities and developers for the 25 year period. The properties are then handed back to the local authority.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	471	Until recently AHBs could borrow for 0.5% but we are paying €633,000 per unit. That is an astronomical figure and the maintenance does not run to that kind of figure to bridge the gap between the actual cost of the build and the final figure of €633,000. That is all I am saying.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	472	All PPPs undergo a public service benchmark so there is a detailed financial analysis to ensure this provides comparable value for money.

If it is not a target that the Secretary General can speak to, can anyone from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform do so?

We know that. Mr. Doyle is the Secretary General. He was asked to give confirmation that the delivery would be met and he would not answer.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	532	I absolutely will answer. It is a target for the industry. There are many factors that impact on the delivery of overall output for the industry. We are trying to set a context across Government. Housing for All is an all-of-government programme. We are trying to set a context that allows industry ultimately to deliver around that target level.

The Government target delivery for this year is 29,000. The Housing Commission estimates that what is needed is anywhere between 40,000 and 62,000. That is almost or more than double what the Government estimates needs to be delivered. Who is right and who is wrong?

The Housing Commission's assumptions range, under a very optimistic set, from 21,000 up to, I believe, 64,000 or 62,000, with that mid range between 40,000 and 60,000.

At the moment, that process is undergoing review.

In Wexford, we have put together our county development plan. the proposal is that almost 60% of zoned lands in Wexford would be d. Mr. Doyle spoke earlier about the fact that the Department had hoped the costs would be reduced to help it meet its targets. Does the Secretary General agree? He is an accountant by trade. Is that not correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	600	That is correct. I am a chartered accountant by trade.

He said earlier we have a viability issue, which means that, clearly, it is not affordable to build the houses, but now it is proposed that on the vacant site that is not being built on we should impose a land tax at a rate of 3% per annum that is not refundable - or, at least, currently not refundable. Does that sound logical? Does it sound like it would serve to reduce housing costs?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	611	My second sentence is that encouraging delivery on zoned land and using a tax measure to encourage delivery on that zoned land to be used is aimed at supply.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	612	Even though the issue was, as Mr. Doyle said earlier, viability. Logically, then, as the Secretary General looking for an increase of €15,000, Mr. Doyle is telling me that it is correct to impose a tax on such land - we are all saying there is a viability issue - and correct to increase the taxes pertinent to housing development in the middle of the worst housing crisis ever.

What will that do? It will serve to drive up the site cost of the lands that remain zoned because, as Mr. Doyle just said, supply and demand is the issue. Less land means higher costs.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	618	Logically, if we have situations where land is being bought at too high a price because people are then hoarding it or sitting on it for a long time, encouraging the use of that land through a tax measure is about encouraging supply.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	620	May I bring Mr. Hogan in on that point? He has worked on that.

Mr. Doyle is the accountant. He is the Secretary General. Logically, does this serve to enhance or to decrease viability? Which is it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	622	Ultimately, by encouraging the use of land, it will bring down the price of land over a period of time.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	626	That is a different issue.

I specifically stated that. One is the residential zoned land tax; the other is the national planning policy to lands. Neither of them makes sense if we are trying to reduce the cost of housing in order to make it viable for commencement of current planning permissions. By the way, going back to Mr. Hogan, I assume that the national guidelines he says are coming will have no bearing on the planning permissions we have that currently are not commenced. I assume that the Department has not made any other recommendation because Mr. Doyle does not even agree with what I am saying. He does not even see that what I am saying is logical.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	656	What does the Department do and what does it choose when it comes to looking at value for money in respect of the various housing schemes? How does it select those if it is seeking that value for money? I remember saying in 2014, when HAP was introduced, that it would become unsustainable if there was not a large-scale housing building programme. We are hearing about PPPs that have been evaluated.We can see the position with turnkey projects. A 2020 review found that it was 30% more cost efficient to build directly rather than use turnkey projects, so there is a value for money issue at play. There are examples of AHBs whereby leases are being subsidised by way of RAS. We know that apart from the human cost, homelessness is very expensive. There are wider societal and economic issues relating to the under-delivery of housing. All of these schemes that involve a short-term element are not permanent solutions. What has the Department done with regard to value for money for each of those schemes? Has it tested them individually? What has it found? What is its methodology?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	657	There are lots of different methods of delivering housing. The overall issue is trying to deliver roofs over people's heads in whatever way we can. Obviously, there are preferred ways of doing that and new build is part of that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	659	We look at all of these from a value for money perspective on each occasion. Unfortunately, we are faced with a number of choices and, ultimately, we have to try to bring about supply and roofs over people's heads.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	665	We can take sample projects or demonstrate that in a variety of ways.

I have a question about the local government fund, something about which I routinely ask, and the review of the baselines and the change in them. The population with regard to the local government fund really dates back about 25 years. That is the basis of how they were originally determined and it has not changed much in that time. The population of the area I represent has doubled in that time but the baseline has not changed and this determines how much local property tax the local authority can spend. You cannot grow a population without growing the services to meet that population increase but that is exactly what has happened. Trying to figure out the local government fund is akin to the third secret of Fatima. I spent several months going through this. If members of the public, particularly those in areas that are growing, really understood this, they would be up in arms because the money is not being spent where it needs to be spent because the system is not population-based. It pays no attention to population. What is happening? I know a political decision was made on this. What information does the Department have? Has it produced reports on how it is be managed in terms of when that change is going to happen because parts of the country are at breaking point in terms of delivery of services that should go with their populations?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	669	The Deputy is correct. The baseline funding has remained unchanged since 2014-2015. It was not possible to adjust the baselines or undertake the review in advance of the local property tax, LPT, allocations for 2023 due to the delayed census and also to take into account the LPT yield date following revaluation. An examination of the current LPT baseline funding has commenced and is expected to conclude in advance of the LPT decisions to be taken prior to the budgets for 2024. The process will include consultation with the sector and relevant stakeholders. Elected members are the key stakeholders in that regard. Previous reviews and studies of local authority funding will be assessed. The Deputy is correct. Undertaking such a review is complex and the circumstances of local authorities vary so significantly in terms of population, population density, service needs, geography, topography, roads and coastlines. They are all-----

It was not 2014. In fact, it goes back to the needs and resources model, which would have taken account of the census of 1996 as opposed to a more recent census. There is no reason why this could not be reviewed even using the 2016 census. It could then have been amended and it should be amended at each census.

I am sorry; I know it is not the most exciting of subjects but I just want some clarity. My questions are largely for Ms Costello and Mr. Doyle. I want to understand the decision process involving that €314 million. As outlined by the officials so far, the Department felt that this was a moving around of funds that had been saved in another area and it informed that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that this was how it was going to proceed and bring it to Cabinet. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had not preapproved that but said the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage could proceed and carry out a virement - I am not an economist so I am not good on that word - but that the next time the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage did that, it had to tell the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform beforehand. Is that a fair representation of what happened?

The total cost of the commercial rate waivers for 2021 was just under €500 million. Some of that was subject to a technical Supplementary Estimate, which would have undergone the regular process.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	682	I think it was about €197 million. That was not a technical Supplementary Estimate. It was a substantive increase.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	684	A substantive increase is where the total amount made available to the Department is increased.

A total of €197 million of it was subject to a substantive Estimate. That was because there was insufficient funding in the Vote because of the in-year Government decisions to do the commercial rate waiver. At the time of the discussions between ourselves and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, significant savings were identified, and it was a judgment call, but it was felt that these savings could be used to fund the remainder of the commercial rates waiver-----

Did the Department come to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and say it was going to do that?There would have been ongoing conversations around the amount that would have been required. The Department would have been identifying savings. At that stage, it would have been approximately six weeks before the end of the year. The Department was doing a calculation to identify savings.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	694	I am not sure what the Deputy is referring to.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines indicate that the better approach to transferring the funding is to use the Supplementary Estimate. There is a point somewhere. Maybe the Comptroller and Auditor General will contribute.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	696	I think the Deputy is referring to the letter of sanction, which issued in July 2022, where the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reiterated the condition that prior approval should be secured before.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	698	As a part of the sanction process, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage would have approached our Department to look for formal sign-off on all the virements that would have happened throughout the year. As part of that, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined, we would have highlighted to the Department the need to seek provisional sanction in advance going forward.

I refer to the discussion and specifically to the points Deputy Hourigan is making regarding our concern about such a large virement of €340 million being unvoted. The lack of democratic accountability is significant.

The problem is that neither the Dáil nor the committee was involved. There is an issue here. I ask you to convey that back to the Department. We will not hold you, as principal officer, over a barrel for it, but we ask you to bring this back to the Secretary General and the Minister. We need democratic accountability.

I have discussed it with Mr. Doyle in the past. I know we are trying to deal with a legacy situation. Nobody in this room has been responsible for the creating the situation. When these small AHBs reach the end of life, what happens to the property? What happens to the tenant? What protections are there? Some of these small AHBs were set up in order to provide 20, 30, 40 or 50 houses. They are a credit to the people who set them up. They were people who worked voluntarily. I am not casting any aspersions on them. However, we are reaching a situation where things are moving on. Some people may be moving on in years and the homes are coming out of the terms of loan. What happens now? What is happening in a particular AHB - I will not name it, but you know the one to which I am referring - is that there are no rent controls, the tenants are being handed forms to claim rent supplement from social welfare and €10,000 in hello money is being charged before one gets in the door. That is ruling people out. These houses were built by the taxpayer for social housing purposes to meet a housing need; in most cases, for the most vulnerable groups, that is, elderly people and people with disabilities. People who were tenants of social housing now find themselves dealing with a management company that has been brought in. That is the interface and with whom the tenants are dealing. I brought this to the attention of the agency and the regulator. It is a very welcome move that we have a regulator. The head of the regulator seems to be a formidable woman. I wish her well in her work. However, the houses effectively stop being social housing. You are correct in that there is a bit of time with some of the houses, but some of them are maturing very quickly. They are out of the term of the loan, which means we could wind up with the wild west, for want of a better term. What can we do in the short term? Someone needs to get a grip on this, because I do not have answers for these tenants. Other Deputies and councillors throughout the country do not have answers. This problem will come out all over the place in the coming months and years. What can we do to try to give some level of comfort? The thought of taxpayers paying for rent on a house that they built is absolute madness. The fact there is a possibility that these houses could be moved on without us, the council or anybody else having any control over it, and with hello money being charged, is crazy stuff. The houses were built for vulnerable people and people are being asked for €10,000. What can we do about this in the short term?

We have already spoken to the regulator with regard to what can be done about that specific incidence, once we establish all the facts around it. Both of the schemes go back a very long period of time. We are trying to establish the facts and work with the regulator. We have spoken about the unencumbered units, the terms of reference of which my colleague has here beside me. We will provide those to the committee. We will work through those issues. What we have seen more often, or what colleagues and the regulator have seen more often, is a situation where some of these AHB properties, in the circumstances you describe where people may be getting on in years and so forth, have been transferred to other AHBs. We insist on that being done at no cost, which is what has happened.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	742	The Peter McVerry Trust takes on many of these smaller units.

I do not wish to rush you, but the problem is that a situation has arisen whereby a private management company is already in.The private management company is now dealing directly with these tenants and handing them the forms to go and claim the rent supplement. That company's officials are the people who are now setting the rent. They are now the people in charge. Can anything be done in the short term? I know one of the principal officers, Mr. Roger Harrington, is dealing with the issue and he did come back to me on it. I ask Mr. Doyle to ensure that a principal officer sits on top of this because it is an escalating problem.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	744	There are actually a number of principal officers trying to deal with the situation going forward to put in whatever safeguards need to be put in. If those ultimately need to be further legislative safeguards, we can propose those as well. With regard to that specific matter, yes, that specific principal officer who appeared before the committee last week is dealing with that matter to try to establish the facts that go back a long period and work with the regulator. The initial piece now is that the regulation model is a significant change. I think it has helped in the industry significantly and this is exactly the type of thing we have a regulator for at this point.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	745	Okay. The allocations do not come through the local authority. They have not even come within the term of the loan. While the loan was maturing and before it was discharged, it was not the usual situation where the allocations came through the local authorities. The assessment of social housing need has to be done by the local authority. We cannot have a situation where people make it up as they go along. The local authorities have the lists of who is eligible in terms of income, housing need, family size, disabilities and the rest of it. We cannot go outside of that and break that model with houses that are built by the taxpayer. We have to get that back on track. This is the final thing I will ask of Mr. Doyle. Will he please put it to the Minister to try to come up with a model? None of us will be here in 25 years' time but the people who are sitting here will be facing similar problems. This will be a rolling issue. We must move to an equity model. In other words, instead of the State giving a loan, grant or whatever else under the five different models, which we went through last week so I will not do so again, but which included the different housing and financing programmes for AHBs, we must put in place an equity model. If the State owned 10% of those, this could not happen. The State or the local authority has control of it. It is not about standing on anybody's windpipe or anything like that. When we build something and pay for it, we cannot just take three deep breaths and head off into the wild west. We have to try to manage this in a housing crisis. These are houses for social need. We have to try to make sure that those people who are going into them are those who are most in need and that they have a reasonable way of dealing with the landlord or AHB. One of the pieces of information I ask Mr. Doyle to take back with him is to have a discussion within the Department and also perhaps with the Minister-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	746	That discussion is under way.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	747	Mr. Doyle advises the Minister. He needs to advise him of this issue. In fairness to the Minister, he is dealing with a lot. I criticise him often but he has a lot on his plate. He may not be aware of the snowball effect of this. It is the case with a number of these AHBs that the loan has been or will be discharged fairly soon. We are facing a really large problem.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	748	Three elements of work are under way within the Department at the moment. There is the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, review, which the Minister has been part of and is essentially happy with at this point. We now need to make a proposal to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about changes to the CALF model, which we have worked through and on which we have had stakeholder consultation. The second piece is the unencumbered units and what happens in that regard, which is much of what the Chairman has been talking about. That piece of work is ongoing. The third piece of work is what the Chairman referred to when he spoke about the equity piece, which has been raised by some of the bigger AHBs. We now have to continue a conversation and try to get to a point where we have an approach to this gearing issue. I spoke to representatives of the association and also the alliance that represents the big AHBs last week. This issue of gearing was raised. That is, therefore, another work stream.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	750	There are arguments in favour of equity. There are arguments in the other direction as well. We have to come down on what the right policy decision is.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	752	Absolutely. What is very important is that the AHBs have for the most part been an excellent partner in terms of delivering social housing-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	754	-----so we have to allow them to deliver social housing into the future. Therefore, we have to come up with a model that works for that reason. At a general level, it is really important when we talk about these issues that we commend the huge work that people have done-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	756	-----and in many cases on a voluntary basis.

Everything we have heard today has been the Department blaming everything that is outside of its control from interest rates to inflation and now land banks. The reality is that land hoarding is a false narrative and if it does exist, it is very much in a very small minority of cases. It certainly does not exist in County Wexford and I doubt very much if it exists in the Secretary General's home county of Waterford. It may exist in a small percentage of cases here in Dublin. We need to get to grips with the real issue, which is planning policy. Mr. Doyle has now been Secretary General for three years, in which time he has had much correspondence from me pointing out where planning policy is, in effect, causing problems of viability and all the other issues. Mr. Doyle is well aware that 60% of the planning permissions granted will never commence because of viability, and 70% of those not granted will never commence because of viability. The Department blames all the outside influences, however, and then if planning is to commence, it wastes the taxpayers' money by purchasing property that is essentially driven up by the Department's lack of action.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	758	The Deputy might ask her question.

The Department has done it all by itself because it has refused to take any cognisance of the poor planning policy that has left us where we find ourselves today. If I were the Minister, I certainly would not be giving Mr. Doyle an increase; I would be asking him to go and look for a new job.

How is he going to put that in place as regards building standards nationwide?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	761	I will ask my colleague, Mr. Ó Coigligh, to respond because this is one of his areas.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	762	The State is paying a significant bill and will continue to pay a significant bill to address legacy defects, particularly going back to the Celtic tiger years. It is important to note that while there may be more work to be done, a huge amount has been done over the past decade to ensure that what happened in the 2000s and before does not happen again. That has happened at a number of levels. New construction standards came into place in 2013, for example. New building regulations came into place in 2014 that very clearly assign responsibility for each stage of the construction process and the sign-off in that regard. We have supported the local government system in terms of developing a shared service office and national building control office. In other words, a huge amount has already been done to improve standards. Lastly, there was the enactment this year of legislation that will provide for the construction industry-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	764	-----to ensure that builders are controlled. That is a huge suite of measures. The Government agreed only last week when it was looking at the defects that there is also a need for an independent building standards regulator. That is a huge amount.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	765	What regulations has the Department implemented to ensure that the mica and pyrite issues do not reoccur? How are these new regulations being monitored currently?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	766	Construction product regulations came into effect in 2013, for example, with regard to construction standards that we use.The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, prepared additional national advice and guidance on the EN product standards, namely SR 16 and IS 325. The Department recently introduced specific guidelines on the marketing of concrete blocks which address some of the issues. The Minister asked for the addition of quarries in Donegal. The Department has taken many steps and the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office works with local authorities to ensure those steps are enforced.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	767	Have we had any cases of defective concrete blocks since the new regulations were implemented?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	768	I am not aware that we have. The Deputy might have seen that an issue arose last year in Donegal. The Minister requested an audit that was carried out by the national building control office in association with Geological Survey Ireland, GSI, and Donegal County Council. They found some fault with paperwork and process but the block standards seemed to be fine. That shows the regulations are working.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	770	It is an ambition to re-establish it. Other priorities probably got in the way.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	772	I will need to come back to the Deputy about where we are on the re-establishment of the body but it is committed to.

However, as I explained, it is not as though we are starting from a position of zero regulation or even poor regulation. We have vastly improved the regulatory scene and this is a further step.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	795	With regards to this regulator we need to look at the evidence, design the structures, see what legislation is required and scope out the role of the regulator. A considerable body of work must be done in order to get it right. We must do it as quickly as possible, but that is what needs to be done.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	796	Mr. Ó Coigligh outlined some of the legislation. SI 288 of 1949 is Standard Specification (Solid Concrete Building Blocks Made with Natural Aggregate) Order. I will not read it all but the relevant part states:The sand, i.e. fine aggregate passing a 3/16 in. test sieve, shall not contain more than 10 per cent. passing No. 100 test sieve.(a) Harmful Impurities.The aggregate shall not contain harmful material in sufficient quantity to affect adversely the strength or durability of the concrete. Mica, shale or similar laminated materials, or soft particles, shall not be present in such a form or in such quantity as to affect adversely the concrete.When tested in accordance with the method given in Appendix A the quantity of harmful impurities passing a No. 200 test sieve shall not exceed (i) in the case of fine aggregate 3 per cent. for natural sand and 5 per cent. for crushed stone, and (ii) in the case of coarse aggregate 1 per cent.We know "coarse" means there is a lot of stone in it. That is from 1949. It was brought to my attention this week. We have legislation since 1949 and here we are in the year of our Lord 2023 and it seems as though no one was watching this. Who tests the sand? We have been lucky where I live, except for north Offaly. Edenderry was affected by pyrite but so far - touch wood - we have good companies providing good quality products in that part of the midlands. Where are the tests done and who is doing them? We could paper Leinster House with regulations, statutory instruments and legislation but who actually does this? Does someone go to the concrete plant unannounced every now and then and take a sample?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	797	A number of different processes are involved in ensuring the standards. For example, the NSAI gives certification based on documentation provided by companies that get independent geologists and testing laboratories to provide certified evidence. A huge evidential trail is required to get a product-----
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	798	Who looks for that? Who is it produced to?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	799	It can be produced to the NSAI or the local authority as the building control regulator.

This should not be a trail. It should be a straight line.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	801	Due to the complexity of product, it may require different-----

Every few hours a quality control person who was on site took a sample. That was in a different jurisdiction where the local authority and relevant government departments had to have sight of those samples. Problems start at source. The source is the concrete plant. We know what has happened. There is no need to rehash all of that. We ended up with mica, pyrite and all kinds of problems because of it. I have quoted the 1949 legislation. Who will enforce it? This is the solution.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	803	The 1949 regulations still need an enforcement system.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	807	We have an effective system. We did not have an effective system in place when these problems arose in the 1990s and 2000s. Many measures have been put in place as I have explained. The national building control office has a specific programme of inspection and inquiries. The Department funds and works with GSI for dirt testing.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	808	Even the smaller local authorities have many people with a science background, including engineers. Would it not be simple for random tests to be done or for companies to supply a sample?There are not that many in a given local authority area in order to display a sample. As I said, think of whoever is here in 25 years' time. We now sit here with a bill for €2.5 billion, that is, for 2,500 million euro, because of the hands-off approach. Surely we can stop creating these problems and allowing these problems to arise. We have the legislation and the knowledge. We have more knowledge than they had in 1949. Think of what this country was like in 1949 after the Second World War, recession and so on. In 1949 they were able to solve this. Do you know why they were able to do that? It was because they had a clerk of works and local authorities that kept an eye on things. That was despite the fact that the country was very poor. Here we are now and we cannot seem to do because everything goes in a roundabout way through trails. There cannot be a trail. This has to be straightforward.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	809	I believe there is a good system in place to provide assurances that material from quarries and concrete products are being put on the market safely. We had an audit that the Minister requested in regard to issues that arose in County Donegal again recently. That made some recommendations about the need for further resources to help local authorities to carry out their functions. The audit showed the extent of work that went in, the extent of compliance which showed where there were gaps in the paperwork, and on the back of that the Government has decided to build on the good work that has been done and the good controls that are now in place to bolster that by putting in place a national regulator.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	810	That is fine. That will be an office which will be staffed. What I am saying is that out on the ground where it matters, there is a concrete plant and a construction site. The concrete is made in the concrete plant and goes to the construction site. I am saying this by way of being helpful. I saw it in operation. There has to be a simple way of dealing with this. There have to be tests at the concrete plant on a random, weekly or monthly basis.

I am saying that the Department must look at this. As I said to Mr. Doyle, we are in a process now where we are setting up this regulatory authority. I am trying to suggest a way whereby we ensure that we do not keep making these problems for ourselves and creating huge bills for the taxpayer. I ask the Department to look at seeing whether there is a way of simplifying that. It has to be done at the concrete plant and what is called the batching plant. It has to be scrutinised by an official with an engineering and scientific background who can state there is no mica in it or that the components in the batch are correct. There is no other way. You have to stop creating this problem at source. When it gets to the site it is too late. It is all over. A load of concrete arrives and rain, hail or snow, that load of concrete has to be poured. If the sky opens it has to be poured. That is the reality. That is how it works on any building site.

Will they re-examine this issue of the regulatory body? It is grand to have all these bodies but we have more quangos than would fill the Phoenix Park. We need a very straight line in regard to the tests being taken at the concrete plant, particularly at the batching plant so that it can officially be stood over and somebody in a public body somewhere can say "Yes" or "No" and if it is not up to standard that they can intervene and stop it. Otherwise, the wheel keeps going around.

It is accounted for under the subheading B4 with an expenditure of €48 million in 2021 against an estimated €56.5 million. In regard to the commencement of the review for the 2019 to 2021 multi-annual water programme, has that commenced yet? How advanced is it at present?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	828	The review is going on at the moment. Having multi-annual funding gives some confidence into the sector and has allowed these plants and the issues around them to be addressed over a period by the local authorities, so it is given that structure. I have a note on it here, I was talking to colleagues in that area last week so my understanding is that the review is now starting.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	829	In regard to the rural water programme, it is of critical importance. In my constituency more than 500 households in north Mayo, in Porturlin, Portacloy, Srahataggle and Carrowteige, do not actually have a domestic running water supply. The urgency and importance of measures for consideration in the future multi-annual rural water programme from 2022 to 2025 needs to be expedited. Currently it has not been published. What is the reason for this delay?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	830	I am not sure of the reason for the delay but I absolutely take the point in regard to Mayo. It has the highest proportion, only Galway rivals it in any way, in regard to the number of private group water schemes. In regard to the 2019 to 2022 programme, I believe about 18% of the total funding has been paid through Mayo County Council. The importance in that part of the country is recognised. We have significantly increased the funding overall on this scheme over the past number of years.

We are now in 2023. It is causing huge concern among communities in north Mayo.

The answer to that is the end of quarter 1. In 2021, the spend in this area on current and capital was €48 million. It was €44 million the previous year. Our budget for 2023 is just under €68 million. We are providing the funding. We are willing to work with local authorities on this. We absolutely recognise the importance of it.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	838	I thank the witnesses and the staff of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the work they have done preparing for today's meeting.I thank the Department for its work as well and I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and Ms O'Connor for attending. I also thank Ms Costello, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, for coming along and providing information to us. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is a big Department with big issues and challenges. We can see and understand that. Regarding the themes, there are a number of issues to come back to us on, including the breakdown of the costs in respect of the PPPs, or the €633,000 per unit. If the delegates are here again, could they discuss further progress on the generic house designs, in addition to the unencumbered units of AHBs when then they come up with the term of the loan? I know a principal officer is working on that but could the committee be kept briefed on it in general? The regulatory authority is another issue. There are several other issues. The delegates will see them from the transcript. I have just mentioned four of the big ones. The big themes coming up today, along with a range of others, are speed of delivery and value for money. We recognise that there are many challenges. We obviously wish the Department well with them. Hopefully, we can move things along and speed things up. Is it agreed that the clerk will seek follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions? Agreed. Is it agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefings provided for today's meeting? Agreed.

There is a substantial body of work, so I ask for members' co-operation. We will try to move along through the business efficiently. The first item is the minutes of the meeting of 19 January. They have been circulated. No member wishes to raise an issue. Are the minutes agreed to? Agreed. As usual, they will be published on the committee's webpage. The second item is the accounts and financial statements. Seven sets of accounts and financial statements were laid before the Houses between 16 January and 20 January. I ask Mr. McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to address these first.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	840	The first set of financial statements is that of the Medical Council for 2021. It received a clear audit opinion. No. 2 is the statement of City of Dublin Education and Training Board for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion but I drew attention to non-compliance with procurement rules. I think the figure in that case was about €2.5 million. There is some detail given in the financial statements about that. No. 3 is the statement of Kerry Education and Training Board for 2020. There was a delay in the completion of the production of the accounts. It received a clear audit opinion. No. 4 is the statement of the Adoption Authority of Ireland for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion. No. 5 is the statement of the National Economic and Social Development Office for 2021. It received a clear audit opinion. No. 6 is the statement of the Environment Fund for 2021. It received a clear audit opinion. No. 7 is the statement of the Climate Action Fund for 2021. It received a clear audit opinion. There are two sets of financial statements that were, it appears, presented late. Those of the Medical Council, which were certified by my office on 30 June, were presented only on 16 January. Those of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, signed at the end of June, were presented only on 19 January. In line with the committee's policy, it may want to seek an explanation in relation to those.

Therefore, the amounts we will be talking about are relatively small in terms of overall expenditure. I acknowledge that and certainly do not want to diminish the very good work done. The figure for audiovisual equipment is €240,000, that for cleaning contracts is €259,000, that for learner support is €512,000 and that for school meals is €366,000. These are not the kinds of figures that would normally jump out at me. I realise there is a real issue in terms of the amount provided for school meals and under-provision in terms of the real cost. I would have thought these figures related to the kinds of services you would tender for. They have jumped out at me. I completely understand that if something turns up on a Friday or a school has been broken into, you might have to get security or some such service, but these figures do not seem to fall into that category. It is disappointing to see that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	845	That is why I am drawing attention to it. These are things that can in most cases be sorted. That is really why you need a specialist, particularly in a very big education and training board like the one in question. One reason the expenditure of City of Dublin Education and Training Board is so high is that Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants are paid.There are actually two businesses in there. From memory, one is approximately €350 million, so by comparison with other education and training boards, ETBs, we are looking at maybe €250 million.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	846	Why do the SUSI grants go through the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB? Is it a historical issue?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	847	When SUSI was set up, effectively there had been a decentralised grants application, allocation and payment system but that was centralised when SUSI was created in 2012 or maybe 2013. One of the vocational education committees, VECs, or ETBs was looked for to take it on and the City of Dublin ETB won the application.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	849	It is approximately €350 million. That is just a ballpark figure from memory.

There are two bodies we have to write to, the Medical Council and the Adoption Authority of Ireland, regarding late supply and we have the issue of the CDETB. Is Deputy Murphy making a proposal regarding that?

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	858	It is agreed that we will write to the other two bodies and note the listing of accounts and financial statements. Agreed. As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes. No. 3 on our agenda is correspondence. As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion at this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated to members and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of committee meetings and published on the committee’s webpage. The first category under which members have flagged items for discussion is category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings. The following correspondence has been held over from our meeting on 19 January. The first is No. R1640B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 21 December 2022, which provides information requested by the Committee regarding the ownership of National Broadband Ireland and an update regarding the national broadband plan. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. This correspondence was held over so I propose we deal with it today because Deputy Munster is not here. I propose we follow through on that action. There is a lot of information in it which members may find useful. I am sure they have read the correspondence and will take further time to examine the matter because it has been of concern to the committee. I hope the reply was beneficial.  No. R1654B from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is dated 10 January 2023 and provides information requested by the committee regarding Benefacts. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	859	On the review referred to in the first sentence, instead of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform trying to convene the various interested parties, the approach that appears to have been adopted looked at individual organisations, units of Government or Departments in isolation. I think that was a test that almost predetermined the outcome. We saw that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, relied on the data sources and collection that Benefacts had done, whereas another State body would never use Benefacts. It was important to look at this collectively rather than individually and that is not what happened. It is useful to see that as a process and understand that this can be a deficiency if something like this happens again. At this stage, we know there is another proposal from the Department of Rural and Community Development. We should request the Department's business case for that and also the proposal for the scope of Pobal. We could usefully ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a copy of the two reports done by Benefacts. It compiled research on behalf of the Department on people working in the non-profit sector regarding pay and pensions. It would be useful to see those. Obviously, in a modern public service, information is important for making good decisions. In fact, if I remember rightly, the point that good quality information delivers or assists with good governance was made in the Indecon report. That is the point I have been trying to make throughout our discussions on this issue. I ask that the committee make those two requests.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	860	Is that agreed? Agreed. We have raised the issue of a business case regarding the Benefacts decision a number of times and we have not seen one to date. For a relatively small amount of money, Benefacts provided a large amount of information across a wide area. It was a great go-to service for Department officials and public bodies.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	861	The Indecon report stated that if the service was to be dispensed with-----

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	863	-----there should be something in place beforehand. Now we have a vacuum of information and obviously the CSO, for example, will be relying on the information it had from that source for several years. However, at some point, the information will not be accepted by EUROSTAT. Then there is the cost involved. I cannot get my head around the way this was handled.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	864	Yes, it was an interesting decision. I have not heard the logic for it yet. The committee has discussed the matter many times. We will persevere and seek information in the two areas outlined. We have agreed to note and publish No. R1654B regarding Benefacts. No. R1657B from Ms Eeva Leinonen, president of Maynooth University, is dated 11 January 2023 and provides information requested by the committee regarding a proposed student centre and student levy fund. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. I note the correspondence states that the projected costs were more than 50% of the original contract, which would mean a breach of public procurement rules would be likely. That seems to be the rationale. Deputy Murphy has indicated she wants to speak on this matter.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	865	I know something about this issue. It relates to a facility that was to be built for students. A levy was collected for a considerable period and then increased. Students agreed to pay it in return for getting this facility. When the contract was awarded and work had started, it was discovered that the costs exceeded the original contract amount. I do not know how the tender system worked to allow that to happen.We have been told in this response that members of the governing authority are drawn from the staff, students and graduates and external organisations. I am not sure who the decision maker is in this regard. The students seem to have been blindsided by this decision. I met with them afterwards. We are being told it is the governing authority that has responsibility. Was the governing authority the decision maker in this case? I am not sure. I think students would have known if they were represented on that body and they did not seem to know. Further on, it is stated that following a decision by the governing authority to terminate the contract, the university is currently considering the scope for legal redress against certain parties involved in the project with a view to cost recovery. I refer to the contract being already terminated. I presume it is possible when something is terminated to still proceed with cost recovery if it was not within or deviated from the contract. It is difficult to understand this.

If works were carried out, then obviously the contractor would have to be paid up to the point where the contract was legally brought to an end.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	867	On the next page of the document, regarding the next steps, it is stated that following the decision of the governing authority to terminate the contract for the construction of the student centre, a student facilities project advisory group was established to make recommendations to the governing authority on the development of student facilities for the immediate, medium and longer term. The group comprises students and staff. There seems to be some duplication here. Is the governing authority the decision maker? The students are represented on it. I do not understand this process. The real question is what happened to the levy moneys that were specifically collected for this project, which has not been delivered and it certainly does not appear that it is going to be delivered in the short term.

It is certainly not clear to me and the Deputy is also not happy that this provides the answer.

It is being mentioned that little pods will be put in here and there and outside seating and that kind of stuff. The university has grown and there have been some great additions made to it to date. The number of students has increased in recent years from approximately 5,000 to about 15,000 now. Student facilities should be improving as the institution grows. What is a university without students? Catering for their needs is part and parcel of this context. The understanding regarding this levy was that it was being collected for the delivery of a building.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	873	The letter states that none of the levy funds have been used on the project to date and therefore the university is recognising, certainly from what is stated in this letter, that it does have an accumulation of student levy funds. Reference is made to €11 million having been collected to date.

We will move on. No. R1658B, from Ms Dee Forbes, director general, RTÉ, dated 11 January 2023, provides information requested by the committee regarding expenditure on a musical production, Toy Show - the Musical. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Regarding this matter, further correspondence has been received today, dated 11 January 2023. I have not had a chance to read it because I only got it in the last few minutes. Members can take a moment to read it. The one thing that became clear from reviewing the correspondence yesterday was that it sets out very little information regarding numbers, data or any information of substance. Commercial sensitivity is cited, but what the committee needs to know is how many shows were originally scheduled and how many went ahead. I understand some were cancelled due to illness. Generally, some shows will have a provision for that, but what provisions did RTÉ have? Were there understudies in place? I am sure the events were insured. RTÉ indicated that many television shows have taken several years to bed in and for the investment to show whether it has been successful. I would like RTÉ to advise the committee if it is considering proceeding with Toy Show - the Musical in 2023. RTÉ has indicated that it has tried to balance its response with the committee's legitimate interest in understanding the rationale for the project. From what we have seen in this response, the organisation has failed to do that. It has provided little or no information of note in terms of what we need to know in respect of this committee's task. RTÉ states in its letter that its remit covers more than commercial activity and that the organisation has a balance to strike in respect of providing clarifications. While it is good to receive this information back from RTÉ, I do not think it tells us anything and does not answer any of the questions we had. I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	879	We can do that.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	880	I originally raised this issue when the show was being advertised and I do not think that it had commenced so it was not in the time when there were difficulties with illness or things like that. RTÉ repeatedly told us in its letter how cash strapped it was and said, "We must try new things, to grow and sustain all we are obliged to do." I have no problem with innovation and trying new things. However, I would expect that there would be some degree of a cost-benefit analysis beforehand and I am not sure if that has happened. RTÉ has a specific remit. On the last page of the letter, it states that RTÉ "will of course conclude a much more detailed analysis of Toy Show the Musical in due course. As would by typical of musicals of this scale and ambition, our aim is to bring the show back over a number of years to recoup our investment.” So it does appear the intention is to repeat the musical. It would be useful to see if RTÉ will conduct a review in advance. I am sure that venues must be booked a long time in advance but it would be useful to see the review. I think that it would be quite useful to ask RTÉ if it has included the cost of promoting the musical in its cost-benefit analysis. I ask because the event was heavily promoted and there may be opportune costs in terms of where they slot that in when it comes to other advertising. I shall outline one of the things that has been brought to my attention. With live shows there is always a risk and sometimes they do not work out as people would like because people can get sick and we know that this winter has been particularly difficult. RTÉ needs to learn a few lessons such as telling people well in advance if there is a risk that a show may not happen. I say that because people were in their seats awaiting the musical to begin having bought all their stuff in the shop beforehand and it was only then they were advised the show would not start. I know ten people who spent €500 in the shop and then took their seats but then everyone was advised that the show was not going to start so all of their popcorn and everything else was added to the cost. There were people, for example, who had booked hotel rooms and made travel arrangements, etc. Many people were disappointed when the show was cancelled. All of that must be factored into the associated risks. RTÉ should demonstrate fair play by telling people about the risks well in advance and I hope that it has learned its lesson. The committee should seek the review that has been mentioned. I have no problem with RTÉ being innovative, trying different things and trying to earn cash in different ways but I want to know was a cost-benefit analysis ever considered. We are likely to have RTÉ in again this year and it would be useful for us to see the review as part of its profile.

First, if RTÉ is proceeding with another musical will it conduct a review first? RTÉ has indicated that so it looks like RTÉ will proceed and we must get it confirmed whether a review will be carried out. The Deputy raised the issue of giving notice of cancellations and asked a very legitimate question. She asked how many shows were originally scheduled for last Christmas, how many shows went ahead, was there a loss and has a cost-benefit analysis been carried out. Her questions capture all that we need know and I thank the Deputy.

I am thinking of the scale of the task ahead of us. Commercial semi-State organisations must make commercial calculations so inevitably with such a remit there will be losses as well as successes. Let us consider the scale of public spending in the HSE, for example, which is more than €20 billion. I think that we could have multiple meetings of this committee on that budget line alone. I wonder whether investigating what happened with the show is the best use of our time. I think that Deputy Verona Murphy is right. The context of this discussion should be when RTÉ seeks public funding in the context of a licence fee and so on. I hope that I am not wrong about this but I am not sure that RTÉ is directly responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	883	No, it is not. RTÉ is not directly responsible but substantial funding goes from the Department to RTÉ, which obviously has a hugely important programme. The Deputy is correct that what this committee is debating here concerns hundreds of thousands of euro here as opposed many billions.

I am not saying this issue is not important. I just think that, on balance, in terms of the scale of work that this committee has, we would be better spending our time elsewhere.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	887	The context is that RTÉ is faced with substantial financial challenges thus leading to a number of questions. This committee has had RTÉ in here a number of times as there has been a number of issues that we have been concerned about. Both the work that this committee has done and some of its recommendations have been useful. Of course we, as a committee, have encouraged RTÉ to broaden its commercial activity and increase the amount of commercial funding coming in. All that is true but context is everything. RTÉ, as the public sector broadcaster, has an important role and, by and large, it has fulfilled that role fairly well. In terms of context, we must ensure that the State broadcaster is on sound financial footing. RTÉ has gone through a rocky period and we want to make sure that it is coming out of that space. The Deputy is right that we should not tie up our days and nights with this stuff. However, I believe that we would be negligent if we did not keep an eye on RTÉ and I thank the Deputy for pointing out that. We will seek clarification on the points raised and I hope that will give us further information. The next item of correspondence is R1677 from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General, Department of Justice, dated 13 January, providing information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Matt Carthy flagged this item for discussion. Does any member wish to comment on R1677? No. We will note and publish the item of correspondence. The next item of correspondence is R1678, which concerns big money, from Mr. David Gunning, Chief Executive, National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, dated 13 January, providing information requested by the committee regarding penalty clauses on subsection completion in respect of claims within the agreed dispute management process. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Catherine Murphy and I flagged this item for discussion.

I presume that this relates to the contractual obligation on the other side, which is an issue that I have raised on several occasions. I recall that we have been told that this will not adjudicated on until the whole thing is completed.

We are being told that this is going to be one of the projects and that it will be closely looked at for learning lessons from other similar projects. Some will be lessons about how not to go about a tendering process. Largely it will be about that, but it would be quite useful to know if there are similar projects in other jurisdictions so we could see how that kind of thing worked and the kinds of safeguards that could be done on a phased basis rather than waiting until one gets to the very end. A lot of the delays on this, for example, were at the beginning of the contract. This is what delayed on the delivery to achieve the 2022 completion of the hospital. I do not know where we would look for similar projects in comparable jurisdictions, or whether the Department has looked for that. I believe this could be a benefit when we come to look at the overall review of this. If we are ever going to learn the lessons we have to know how other jurisdictions handle projects of this nature and not make the same mistakes again.

A question we need an answer to is whether the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, can advise as to what the allocation was for budget 2023 so we could see how close they are to the €1.7 billion estimate, and if we will reach that this year.

Is there a Supplementary Estimate if they were to run out of money in July, for example? I am just picking that month out of thin air.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	905	The Supplementary Estimate would only kick in if the capital funds available in the Vote were insufficient for the demands from the HSE overall for their capital programme. At each level there would be a budgeting for the year. It seems to me that the obvious question to ask, in the first instance, is what is the provision for 2023, and to ask the HSE if that is within their own budget. Then if they believe that the allocation in the budget is likely to be insufficient, due to inflation or whatever, the committee can ask where they are going to find the rest of what is required this year. It could end up requiring a Supplementary Estimate.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	917	There is a difference between a claim that is signalled. We will have a claim in relation to a certain item, and then the substantiation of it is where they put forward an explanation and the detail of the basis for the claim. That is the substantiation. A verified claim is a different thing. It comes much later in the process.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	918	I believe there could be more than €600 million in claims signalled. This is really big beef. We are talking about big money if it is in addition to the figures we have here. We can ask the HSE the question next week. We will ask the secretariat to note this and request information from them. We will ask what the budget is and if it will be sufficient, particularly in light of the pending claims, some of which we hope would be settled this year. Some of these might end up in the High Court. We can tease that out with them. It must at least be signalled for discussion. On the completion date, there was a date of March 2024. We must ask the board about the nine-month period for fitting out and for activation. It would be useful to find out from the board if they are still tied to that figure. Another question that I am not clear about is on the moratorium on claims. At what point does that stop? I do not know the answer to that and perhaps we could find this out from the board. Are members happy enough with that? We will note and publish the item of correspondence. I shall now move on to correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence. The following items are related. We agreed to hold them over until a response was received from the Charities Regulator. This has to do with the provision or otherwise of abortion services. The correspondence is: R1574 C, from Deputy Neasa Hourigan, dated 11 November 2022; R1577 C, from former member of the committeem Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, now Minister of State, dated 15 November 2022; and R1601 C from Deputy Carthy dated 24 November 2022. Last week I proposed that we would deal with these as they have been held over for a while. The items concern the alleged operation of a body as a charity that is not registered as such. I understand the same matter was raised at a meeting of the previous Committee of Public Accounts in November 2019. I ask that Members keep in mind the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.  The Charities Regulator confirms an application for registration has been received from the body in question. It is a long time coming but that is what the confirmation is. There is useful information in the correspondence regarding how the registration process works and it is also stated that this can be protracted in certain situations. I am proposing to note the item. I do not believe it is appropriate to publish this correspondence because the body is referenced. Is that agreed? Agreed. Would any member wish to come in to discuss this? Is the committee happy enough? One of the items of correspondence was from Deputy Hourigan. Does the Deputy wish to comment?

The solving of that issue took an incredibly long time, and I am unhappy with that. I do not know when the last time was that we had the Charities Regulator in front of us.

I am trying to be very careful with my language based on the Chairman's comments.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	929	I understand it was raised by at this committee the then Deputy Kate O'Connell. That is going back a few years now. The point was well made that there are issues that have to be dealt with quickly because we are talking about people's health and well-being. It is an issue of concern that it has taken so long. The Charities Regulator was last before the committee on 21 November 2019.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	931	It was raised by then Deputy O'Connell with the chief executive of the Charities Regulator, Helen Martin, at the committee on that date. That is how far back it was.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	932	That is quite far back. From the correspondence it looks to me, although maybe I am reading into it or inferring, that they are not particularly happy with that situation either. Maybe it is something we could discuss with the regulator. Maybe there is a legislative issue we can outline or bring light to. It would be worth adding to the work programme.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	933	I would suggest in the short term that we correspond and ask why there was such a delay. I have not seen the transcript of that meeting. What we have here is a report on the transcript from a number of individuals, including Deputy Hourigan herself. I do not have the benefit of actually seeing the transcript. I suggest we ask the Charities Regulator why in this case it took so long - over three years - and if this is accurate. I do not know whether it is or not but the chair of the Revenue Commissioners, Niall Cody, was very strong on this matter and matters needing to be legal or if matters were legal or illegal. In view of that, we should look for clarification from the Charities Regulator rather than waiting for it to come in later.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	935	That concludes our consideration of correspondence. The next item of business is our work programme. At our meeting on 19 January, we agreed our work programme for January and February. We want to continue the practice of trying to plan at least six or seven weeks out to give everybody, the witnesses and the secretariat, a chance to get their ducks lined up. Next week, we will engage with the HSE to resume examination of its 2021 financial statements, with a focus on expenditure on disability services, including the provision of disability services by outside agencies, which are generally section 38 and 39 organisations; emergency care; and measures to tackle waiting lists. At our meeting last week, we agreed to include GP services, in particular out-of-hours services, and funding of voluntary disability services agencies on the agenda. Members may recall I mentioned at the last meeting that I have been told there are six different models for providing that out-of-hours service. The Taoiseach confirmed the other day that it is a bit ad hoc. I do not want to misquote him but he seemed to indicate it is very fragmented. I remind members that we agreed to defer consideration of the business of the committee for 2 February 2023 to facilitate attendance by members when the President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola, will be addressing a joint sitting of the Dáil and the Seanad.  On 9 February, we will engage with the Department of Health regarding its 2021 appropriation account as well as chapter 12 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2021 on the financial impact of the cyberattack. We have advised the Department that a specific area of interest is expenditure on emergency departments. On 16 February, we will resume our engagement with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth with a specific focus on direct provision expenditure, international protection and emergency accommodation. Members have billions there to get their teeth into, in case Deputy McAuliffe thinks we are dealing with small change here. His point was well made. On 23 February, we are planning to engage with the Central Bank and to request representatives from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Finance. The Central Bank has been notified and the secretariat has not yet received confirmation regarding its availability.

Could we put on the list issues around things like Revolut and so on, because they do not come under the Central Bank? Can we not do that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	937	I do not think so. The Central Bank is not accountable to the committee in relation to its normal functions.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	938	Okay. Thank you.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	939	People need to be thinking about whether there are issues. I am a bit concerned because that is four weeks away. I do not want a situation where we are trying to fill that gap next week, which would be within a 21-day period. I suggest that we revert back to that later in the meeting and members have a think about this. I am concerned about that date. The Central Bank has not confirmed the engagement yet and we are just four weeks away. I am going to hold that back and we will revert to it later in the meeting. On 2 March, we will engage with the State Claims Agency in relation to its financial statements 2021 and chapter 20 of the report on the accounts of the public services, on management of the clinical indemnity scheme. Does any member wish to raise any other matters regarding the work programme? Deputy Hourigan has suggested putting the Charities Regulator on the list.

I have one more suggestion. Given the work we did on greyhounds and the current discussion around Coillte, and as we cannot have Coillte in, it might be an idea to invite the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	941	Is that regarding Coillte?
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	942	Coillte and greyhound racing.

I suggest that given the scale of things and what is playing out at the moment, we would deal with the issue of forestry first.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	946	Absolutely. I am happy to do that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Appropriation Accounts 2021	947	I noted this somewhere on one of the hundreds of pieces of paper around the place. The Deputy is correct that it is something that needs to be looked at. It is agreed that we have the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in regarding forestry in the first instance? Agreed. The other issue is to add the Charities Regulator to the list. If members agree, I suggest we prioritise forestry over the Charities Regulator. That issue is very important but I think that is what we should do, given what is happening at the moment and the concern across the Dáil and the Parliament over that issue. Is that agreed? Agreed.
