#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Taoiseach, atá tagtha ar ais ón obair thábhachtach a bhí ar siúl aige inné le Príomh-Aire na Breataine. Dá mba rud é go raibh an Taoiseach anseo, bheadh sé in ann freagra a thabhairt ar cheist faoin ghrianghraf a tógadh ar chostas €3 milliún leis an iar-Aire Micheál Ó Máirtín i gCorcaigh cúpla bliain ó shin.The Taoiseach announced yesterday a review of procedures for the management and control of major ICT projects in the public sector. As Deputy Rabbitte noted yesterday, it seems to involve consultants reviewing consultants.Arising from the Government decision on this matter, will the review involve a look-back audit of projects currently under way, such as the Reach project? In fairness, it has a website, www.reachservices.ie, with many links to Government agencies. I understand, however, that this cost in excess of €31 million and that €24 million of that was paid to consultants. It is a good website but it cost in excess of €31 million. Will the review announced cater for that? John Citizen contacted me by e-mail last night at 10.20 p.m. to say questions should be asked about the Reach project and whether it has been good value for money. Perhaps the review announced by Government might examine that.Will the review examine a major project between the Health Service Executive and a company called iSOFT? This contract relates to hospital information systems projects. In 2003, iSOFT was recommended to undertake this project following a detailed review by none other than Deloitte & Touche. What has happened this €400 million project since is unclear. The Tánaiste yesterday suggested that the Minister, Deputy Martin, had put a stop to it but I have been informed that the contract for iSOFT was signed following emergency high level meetings between the Department of Health and Children, the Taoiseach's Department and the Attorney General's office earlier this year. Will the review announced yesterday include a look-back audit of projects like Reach and major projects like iSOFT?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The new set of controls on which the Government decided will ensure that major IT projects in all areas are managed to best practice and standards. It will look back on projects. A new cross-departmental peer review is being introduced with immediate effect to cover existing and new major projects. Anything that is ongoing, therefore, will be examined, including the projects mentioned by the Deputy.The new system will comprise senior personnel with a track record of successful management of projects, both IT and otherwise, and will be delivered on time and within budget. It is a cross-departmental agency and will bring the best of public service expertise to bear in all agencies and will be supplemented, where necessary, by external expertise from the private sector and internationally.I wish to clarify the point made by Deputy Kenny this morning and by Deputy Rabbitte. I merely wish to clarify it; I am not taking issue with the point, which concerns consultants watching consultants. It will most likely not be done by consultants. If we are engaged in some major project we could bring in somebody with expertise from the private sector or banking to sit in on the review and give his best advice, as we do in many sectors. It is not a question of a paid consultant coming in to do another consultancy; it would be a group sitting down with somebody with professional expertise who has done this in the private sector. That works very well for us in many ways.From now on the review will apply at various stages of contracts over the full life cycles of the projects, commencing with an initial approach being proposed, and the persons conducting the review will be independent of the project teams.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	2	This is the third or fourth day we have had questions about IT related projects. Obviously, in that kind of parlance the fatal error of this Government is the fact that nobody is prepared to take responsibility when something goes wrong. The Tánaiste has made some effort to redress some of the scandalous waste of public money.I am sure the Taoiseach is a person who likes to set the record straight. Last week, he claimed in the House with some pride that he had rejected the use of outside consultants when the e-Cabinet project was brought to fruition. He said he used his own staff and he was not prepared to bring in outside consultants because, to use his own words, they would cost a fortune.On 15 July 2004, when the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, had responsibility for this project, she explained in her press release that there were not just one set of consultants, not two, not three, not four but five sets of consultants brought in to deal with that particular project. A company called eVision worked on the design and build, Fusio Limited did the on-line viewing, Bic Systems worked on the hardware, Fujitsu Siemens delivered the security systems and PwC did the feasibility study.Is it not a fact of life that a catalogue of gross incompetence is the reason we do not have the additional 2,000 gardaí, the front-line services we deserve and why we still have waiting lists while trolleys are piled up in the corridors of some hospitals?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Is the Taoiseach now prepared, at this late stage, to accept responsibility and have people down the line from him accept responsibility? They will dance to the tune of the consultants and take the credit but when something goes wrong, is there anybody on that side of the House in charge and prepared to accept responsibility for the taxpayers' hard won taxes?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	8	——to allow us correct the ways of the past and deal with these issues in a proper way.Deputy Kenny is right to say that people with design and international expertise were engaged on the e-Cabinet project. The point I made last week is that we did this for under €5 million because we needed the outside expertise to come in only to do some of the design work. We do not have those kind of designers within the system. The work was done by a project team consisting of members of the departmental staff. If that work had been undertaken by outside contractors the project would have cost tens of millions of euro whereas we spent only €4 million. That was my point.Nobody in this House, or on this side of the House, defends waste. Nobody defends consultants where we should not have them.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	12	In many cases consultants come in where the public service does not have the expertise to undertake a job. That expertise is necessary. Where members of the public service have the expertise they do that work under the guidelines set by the Department of Finance. It is not the case that whenever someone comes in waste is created. The impression people attempt to give that every time a consultant does a job it creates waste is incorrect. We are trying to manage systems effectively and are doing so very effectively. We now have more resources than ever before which means we must be more careful. That is what we will continue to do.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Contrary to what the Taoiseach says, last Tuesday he tried to defend this phenomenal waste. He also denied there was a problem. He instanced the e-Cabinet project as an area into which no consultants were brought and boasted that it cost only €5 million. How many people are involved in the e-Cabinet project, apart from the 15 computer geniuses present? Are there 100 people altogether? This project is intended to be great value for money to put the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, on-line so that he does not read the document anyway.There are two questions at issue: one, to use the dreadful phrase, is what happens "going forward", and the other is what action the Taoiseach will take as a result of what has been exposed? We rely entirely on the media to know what was decided at the Cabinet meeting yesterday. I am still not clear on this from the Taoiseach's remarks this morning. It has all the hallmarks of a solution cobbled together by some intelligent civil servant to get the Government over the hump of the single biggest scandalous waste in its seven years in Government.What does the Taoiseach mean when he says there is to be a peer review of all IT contracts? The Tánaiste told us yesterday in the House that "there was no fixed price contract with the consultants. It appears that the more they worked, the more they got paid. There was no incentive in the contract for the consultants to deliver a particular project ". What kind of outside expertise will the Taoiseach bring in? According to The Irish Times this morning these people might be academics and other independent experts. Will they come in and work for nothing, given that we paid Deloitte & Touche €50 million for a botched job?Will the Taoiseach take any action against those consultants? Will the State initiate legal action against the consultants who got away with €50 million of taxpayers' money to leave a mess behind, which the Tánaiste admitted did not deliver the project? We do not know if the Government is writing this off and putting it down to experience. Will legal action be initiated against the consultants and will the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, take any action against any of the three Ministers who left the taxpayers with this bill of €166 million?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The cost of the e-Cabinet project, which was projected to cost €5 million up to the end of last year, was €3.489 million. Civil servants did most of the work on this as additional work, which they did extremely well and kept down the costs. All civil servants can link and feed in to the e-Cabinet system; it is not a system for only 15 of us, it is for the Civil Service to remove the paper mountains that have traditionally been used in the system. It is an effective system, with further enhancements which will be rolled out over the course of the year and next year.Deputy Rabbitte said he is not clear about yesterday's decision. The Department of Finance has a list of Government guidelines to deal with all contracts. Accounting Officers should make sure those guidelines are correctly followed. In the normal course of events when consultants come into the Department they either do work or give advice. There is a distinction between these roles, sometimes they give advice on a short project, sometimes they come in physically to engage in a project as they did with the HSE.The new set of controls the Government agreed yesterday was not cobbled together. It involved issues on which the centre for management, organisation and development, CMOD, in the Department of Finance had been engaged for some time.The Department of Finance became concerned about the PPARS system when the HSE was set up. In the letter, which is in the public domain, and through other meetings it asked the HSE if it really knew where it was going, and was it moving on despite uncertainty about whether it could roll out the package to the entire health system. The Secretary General in the Department of Health and Children also raised the issue and asked for a review of the system over the summer. That is why the HSE was discussing the issue last Thursday.The new set of controls agreed yesterday will ensure that major ICT projects in all areas are managed to best practice standards, namely, Government guidelines which the Department of Finance will consider again to see if there is anything missing. The new cross-departmental peer review process is being introduced with immediate effect to existing and new major projects.The new system will comprise the most senior personnel with a track record of successful project management, both IT and other, of which we have several. In the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and the Department of Agriculture and Food, extremely successful schemes have been rolled out that do this country proud and are internationally recognised as top class systems.

That would be a case of asking somebody in the private sector to give of his or her time and expertise to assist us.

One does not need another consultancy firm to do this.On Deputy Rabbitte's last point about what will happen next, the Comptroller and Auditor General is preparing his report and the HSE decided last week to have a comprehensive review at its meeting on 2 December. When the Government receives that report it will decide what else it should do. We should wait and let the HSE undertake a full evaluation of what happened over recent years.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The Taoiseach has said a new set of controls is being introduced to ensure that ICT contracts proceed in accordance with best practice. Most taxpayers, who contribute their hard-earned euro towards the running of this State, including its health services, believed that was already being done. I am not at all clear regarding what will now be different, except that the Taoiseach is to ask a few favoured businessmen to give up their time to sit in on a committee some Thursday morning. I cannot see what change that makes to the situation.An example of the capacity to use weasel words to get out of a series of ever more costly mistakes and errors can be seen in this morning's The Irish Times, in which a spokesperson for the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, when asked about the e-portal, raised by Deputy Kenny, that disappeared after €3 million had been spent on it, said all the Minister had been doing was announcing the launch of a concept.

That was another one. How can the Taoiseach, as head of Government, go on avoiding taking action against any Minister, no matter how great the cock-up inflicted on the taxpayer, who ends up covering the cost? I cannot see what was involved in yesterday's decision other than a formula to get the Taoiseach over the hump of this debacle. Are there other open-ended contracts?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I have answered that already and will repeat my replies. I have already said to Deputy Rabbitte that the judgment can be made only when we have a full report on what precisely happened between 2001 and 2005 regarding the HSE contract. I cannot make a judgment on that now; it would be unwise to do so.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The Taoiseach's Ministers were asleep.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I presume I will be unable to convince Deputy Rabbitte one way or the other, but yesterday he said we were introducing a system of consultant upon consultant. Today I explained that is not what is envisaged. Rather, we use people with expertise, although Deputy Rabbitte uses the term "favoured businessperson". Were he not trying to argue a political point, the Deputy would see that the project will enhance the public service. The reason consultants are brought in is that sometimes Departments lack in-house expertise and skills, have insufficient resources to complete a task on time or need an independent and objective view.In ICT and other projects in this country, there has unfortunately been a high failure rate. Plenty of figures have come into the public domain in that regard in the last few days. The OECD has issued many warnings regarding issues of public governance and leadership, failure to identify and manage skills, lack of skills to manage external providers and failure to involve end users.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	51	We have been trying for many years, in most areas, successfully, to have proper guidelines in place that are operated carefully and that Accounting Officers, Ministers and officials try to implement. At times, such as when the roll-out of Revenue was carried out, when the payment system for Revenue was changed, and when agricultural issues such as payments to farmers were addressed, it was highly successful. In other areas, there has not been the same success. It is not the case that every time there is an over-run money has been wasted. In many cases, the system changed, developed or was enhanced. In this case, it seems people simply kept on going, although they were struggling to reach the end. As the Tánaiste said yesterday, the open-ended contract in this case was a poor idea.

Obviously, I mentioned that question would be examined in the review. Regarding taking action against Deloitte & Touche or anyone else, we must base our decision on the report's findings and whether they simply continued based on the contract they were given, which was too open-ended. We have closed down such business in the infrastructural area, and we will do so in this area if necessary. There are many people carrying out individual consultancy contracts — companies both small and large — for Departments and agencies.

I hope that he, and especially his Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will support that plan and provide the necessary funding.I wish to address the Taoiseach regarding the Government's commitment to the needs of all children, with special focus on health care provision for them. Is he at all aware of the depth of anger in the wider community regarding the waste of public moneys on the provision of IT systems to the Department of Health and Children and the health sector that have failed and are simply not working? Can he confirm that there is another example of a failed computer system in the health service, this time in a midlands hospital? Does he appreciate the extent of people's anger at the massive waste of public moneys in the engagement of consultants by a whole raft of Departments, something recently exposed in answers to Dáil questions tabled by my colleague, Deputy Morgan? Do the Taoiseach and his colleagues appreciate the reason for that depth of anger? People know the scale of need in society, and that is what lies behind their anger. They recognise that those needs, especially those of children, are not being met. Yesterday Barnardos launched its proposals to tackle child poverty, and I commend its document to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and especially the Minister for Finance as essential reading in the lead-up to the preparation of his budget in December.We understand that the failed PPARS system has now been suspended at a cost of €150 million so far. Is the Taoiseach aware that in reply to a Dáil question from this Deputy——

How can the Taoiseach defend a system whereby money that could be spent on providing essential medical cover and care for all children is instead wasted on consultants and IT systems that do not work? When will he prioritise need, end waste and stop rewarding greed?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The Deputy will appreciate that in most instances where money has been spent to try to improve systems, it is because they are not effective and need to be enhanced. PPARS and other projects were aimed at integrating systems to make them more efficient and so we have more timely information and can provide a better service to the public. That is the reasoning behind them. Regarding the project the Deputy mentioned I attended the other day and the issues raised by Barnardos and other agencies, the Government continues to provide enormous resources across a range of areas, including disadvantage in education, the DATE project and projects on social and community affairs to assist those in need. All the recent UN surveys indicate there has been a dramatic improvement in this regard.However, there are still those who are disadvantaged and excluded and the Government will continue, across health and education, to provide for them. The Deputy is aware the Government has made changes to the medical card system with some 140,000 new cards issued in the last year. Moreover, the Tánaiste has made changes to take net pay into consideration, a measure that helps many families with children. The Government will continue to support the provision of quality housing and other programmes to help those who are disadvantaged.

Does the Taoiseach realise it would cost in the region of €151 million, a comparable figure, to fund the extension of paternity benefit and maternity and paternity leave over a three-year period up to 2008, as estimated by the National Women's Council of Ireland in its recent comprehensive proposals on child care? What measures will the Government introduce to ensure the best standards of care for children, whether that care is provided in the home by one or more parents or in part-time child care?Will the Taoiseach ensure his Government dispenses with consultants and instead consults parents and children on their needs? Only in this way can one properly be informed of the depth of need in our society in this regard. Will the Taoiseach affirm a commitment to the needs of children? He failed to say in his reply whether the Government will provide an extension of full medical card cover to all children under 18 years of age.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The Deputy is aware that the Children First national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children are being implemented nationally. This is a scheme to help those who suffer disadvantage and those on the margins, right across the range of services. The National Children's Office and the various Departments are actively engaged in meeting the needs and requirements of children. This strategy incorporates programmes such as the DEIS project, the new action plan for educational inclusion.I answered the Deputy's question on the medical card guidelines. Eligibility has increased to 1.4 million and an additional 140,000 cards have been issued this year. The Tánaiste has enhanced the scheme to better facilitate the provision for children and we will continue to implement improvements in this regard.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.There are no specific plans to hold referenda during the lifetime of the 29th Dáil. The Government remains committed to ratifying the EU constitution. However, following the discussion at the European Council, we will not at this stage set a date for the referendum or progress the referendum Bill. We will, however, continue to prepare for a referendum and will use the period of reflection to intensify our engagement with the EU constitution and Europe in general.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Recent European Commission research indicates that more than half the population believes Ireland has benefitted from our membership of the European Union. Following the Taoiseach's discussions with his counterparts in other member states, what is the situation regarding the ratification of the EU constitution? Is it likely it will ever be put to the Irish electorate in the format which was rejected in France? Will non-contentious sections be extracted and implemented and some other type of treaty or ratification process be put in place?Has the Government considered what approach we should take? Does the Taoiseach believe a referendum on some form or elements of the draft constitution will be put to the electorate in the course of the Government's lifetime? What future is envisaged for the still extant National Forum on Europe? How many meetings does the Taoiseach expect it to have over the next 12 months and will it have an explanatory and information role in the meantime through hosting public debates on EU issues cental to the constitution as proposed?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I will give my views and those expressed by leaders in other member states. All participants at the European Council agreed the constitution remains a valid response to the concerns of citizens and the best available compromise. We have given ourselves time to reflect on this difficult situation. Some 13 or 14 countries have now ratified the constitution, comprising a majority of member states. At least three or four more will complete a parliamentary ratification process before Christmas, meaning a total of 16 or 17 states will have ratified the draft constitution by the end of the year.The declaration passed at the last Council recognises the different situations and circumstances in the various member states. The particular situation of those scheduled to hold referenda was explicitly recognised by the president of the European Council in his statement after that meeting. There is a clear understanding of the need for an EU-wide period of reflection which will continue through the remaining period of the British Presidency and on through the Austrian Presidency, before a decision is made on how to proceed in June of next year.There have been issues in France where various senior politicians have made conflicting statements about what will happen in the future. The official line, however, is that the constitution was rejected and that a second referendum will not be held. This stance is unlikely to change until after that country's 2007 presidential election. Some of the contenders for that election have already stated their positions in regard to the constitution. The Dutch Government has said it will not hold another referendum and the general view is that it will need time to make any decisions in this regard. My assessment is that nothing will happen in the short term at EU level. The British Government, which is not comfortable with holding a referendum on this issue, will not force the issue during its Presidency. It will be next summer before any progress is made.We in Ireland should continue with the debate. The Government has made the constitution text available through numerous outlets. We have already distributed the explanatory information and a detailed document is currently being printed and will be issued very shortly. The National Forum on Europe will continue. A range of people is involved in debating and engaging with these issues, not only through the forum but through various other organisations. Members of all parties have attended such conferences and seminars. We should continue to engage in this way in the coming months.The debate should continue regardless of whether the constitution in its current form is revived. During the discussions on the draft treaty, there was a lengthy debate as to whether member states should ratify the entire document or particular sections. Some, including the French, were insistent that we should proceed with such a bulky document. I would have been satisfied to omit some of the appendices because they made what should have been a short document grow to 480 pages. The insistence of some members in this regard made it necessary to concede in order to reach a compromise. However, I contend that one could take Parts 1 and 2, which are the reforming parts, and move ahead with that. It would not be feasible to try to reform the entire document because it is based on checks and balances. There are some who would like to push ahead with some elements while removing some of the protections for smaller member states. There is a huge danger in that. I certainly would not support that and I do not think anyone in the House would support it because it would be dangerous for small countries. Regarding the Deputy's question, which is fair, they could move ahead with the early parts. If they do not decide to move by 2007 that issue should be examined subsequently. To be frank, I think that is what will happen.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I understand the position is there may or may not be a referendum on the European constitution in the lifetime of the current Government but that is the only contemplated referendum on an amendment to the Constitution. I ask that question in the context of nine different reports having been produced since 1997 on the matter of necessary or perceived necessary amendments to the Constitution. I take it from the Taoiseach's response there is no intention of bringing an amendment or a number of amendments forward between now and the putative lifetime of the Government. In regard to remarks the Taoiseach has made about a right of audience being given in this House or in the Oireachtas to elected representatives in Northern Ireland, will he clarify whether in the negotiations with Sinn Féin, in particular, there were any side deals on this issue and whether it is his intention to go outside the tentative proposals recommended in a narrow context by the all-party committee?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	73	There is no referendum envisaged at this stage. Perhaps some urgent issue may arise but none is envisaged. Based on the recommendations of the all-party committee we have a good record. We have dealt with the issue of abolition of reference to the death penalty, the issue of judicial oversight was not passed, the abortion issues, local government recognition, the constitutional amendment and conduct of referendum were dealt with, as was the scrutiny of EU business and a host of other recommendations from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution that did not require constitutional change. There is a number of other issues across Departments that have been examined but there are only so many issues that can be dealt with. Some of the issues raised cannot be grouped together satisfactorily. Other issues are, perhaps, not very urgent. The issue of votes for under 18 year olds is not one with which I would agree. I would not agree with all the recommendations. Given that we have had eight on nine referendums during the past five or six years I do not envisage other referendums.On on the issue of Northern Ireland representation, there is an all-party committee report. I undertook to ask party leaders to see if we could implement the recommendations of that all-party committee report. It is not envisaged that members will have rights of audience in this House but, as I said outside the House, it would make sense, in line with the all-party committee recommendation, to examine the basis of discussion at committees of the House when discussing either North-South reports, which we produce every year, updates on the Good Friday Agreement or other relevant all-Ireland issues concerning economic and energy issues. Those issues could be discussed in committees. That would be a useful initiative and one I support but a constitutional referendum in terms of the role of this House is not envisaged.As Deputies are aware there are proposals on Seanad reform which may require amendments, but we are some way off coming to an understanding on that issue.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I think the order indicates that Deputy Ó Caoláin——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	76	My apologies Deputy Ó Caoláin.

I take it from the responses the Taoiseach has already given that he is not now intent on proceeding with a referendum on the draft EU constitution in advance of the next general election and take it, therefore, that he agrees with the recent statement from EU Commission President Barroso who said that, "in all probability, at least for the next two or three years, we will not have a constitution". Does the Taoiseach welcome that statement, as I do?The 2001 report of the task force on autism recommended that urgent attention should be paid by the Government to the need for appropriate constitutional reform to provide clearer provision for the rights of persons with disabilities to education and to provide a more solid base for advanced legislation in this field. Has the Taoiseach picked up on that recommendation from the task force report in 2001? Has it been considered at any time by the Cabinet? Does he have plans to provide for greater constitutional protection for people with disabilities in general given that there is great disappointment at the failure of the recent Disability Bill to address the rights of people with disabilities across all the areas?The Taoiseach referred to Seanad reform. Will the Government bring forward, whether by referendum during its lifetime, a package of constitutional changes to provide for Seanad reform along the lines of directly elected members on a list system with voting rights being provided for citizens in the Six Counties and Irish citizens overseas?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Work is continuing on Seanad reform. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, has been liaising with the Leaders in the Seanad and it is intended to bring forward a report, as I understand it, based on the initial report and the hearings that took place in the Seanad two summers ago.On the disabilities issue, we have the legislation and have made our decision on it. Thankfully, the organisations are working to make the changes happen regardless of what arguments were put previously. I welcome that. I have spoken with many of these organisations, even in the past week.In the last few years the Government has provided for hundreds if not thousands of additional posts in the area of autism to try to address the needs. If it is a constitutional issue it can be looked at by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution but in terms of assisting and providing services for those with autism and to help those with autism who attend schools and health services the Government has continued to put in huge resources. I am not familiar with the report to which the Deputy referred but certainly it has been Government policy to do everything it can to help those who have difficulties, particularly children, with autism.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I heard the Taoiseach say there is a period of reflection in mind and that a referendum may be required after that. Having heard the comments of the French Minister for European Affairs that she did not envisage the French Government putting a referendum again on the European constitution but that what she really means is a period of coercion, what is the reason for publishing a White Paper and the cost of same if in effect the constitution being referred to is legally dead, given that it requires unanimity among all member states? I am interested to hear the cost of this exercise as, apart from being a flight of fancy politically, it will cost the taxpayer. When asked if a constitutional referendum would be required in order for Ireland to participate in the battle groups idea, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, stated clearly that what he had said was merely his opinion. Can the Taoiseach offer any more information on that matter? Does he have any more to go on than the Minister's opinion in referring to the need for a constitutional amendment on Ireland's co-operation with battle groups? It seems that no sooner have we welcomed the end of one illegal army, that the Constitution is being challenged again. Article 15.6.2° states:No military or armed force, other than a military or armed force raised and maintained by the Oireachtas, shall be maintained for any purpose whatsoever.It seems a referendum would be required on that matter. Will the Taoiseach comment on that?The democracy commission and other bodies have been examining the issue of involving young people in politics more effectively. It has been suggested that 18 years should be age not just for voting but also for the entitlement to stand as a Deputy or presidential candidate if one is able to obtain a nomination. There should not be an age bar above 18. Does the Taoiseach have any thoughts about that matter and, if so, does he envisage a constitutional referendum being held on it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I am on the record as having said that I am against that idea. I do not agree that the age limit should be 18 years.The European constitution contains an article and protocol on structural co-operation in defence. Under the arrangements, member states could choose to enter into binding commitments on the provision of military capabilities to be used in undertaking the more demanding tasks of peacekeeping, conflict prevention and international security. It was made explicitly clear that this would be done in accordance with the principles of the UN charter and without prejudice to the specific character of the security and defence policies of different member states. It was also made clear that the arrangements were open to all member states. As I have said previously, the Government will examine that carefully and any decision would have to respect fully our traditions, while not affecting the terms under which our Defence Forces can be deployed under the so-called triple-lock mechanism. Therefore, the matter will have to be examined in that context.The UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has been anxious for this country to participate and he has been asking us to try to find a way of doing so. Deputy Sargent knows that the other neutral states have already decided to participate in it. It is an issue with which we must deal.Both this year and last year, I was being asked to ensure there was sufficient information on the European project generally. I was told that we should provide data and not keep people in the dark, yet now I am being asked not to spend money on providing such data.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	81	That is not much.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Let us be fair.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	83	It is a simple question.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	84	It is important for us to publish a detailed White Paper on this issue, which has been raised repeatedly in the House, and we will do so. As I told Deputy Kenny earlier, there is a period of reflection pending a decision next summer on what will happen. At this stage, I do not see the French or the Dutch being able to make a decision in that regard. The French, in particular, will not make such a decision during a presidential election year. Whatever happens next summer, it is unlikely that those countries will hold a constitutional referendum, but that does not change the position. Europe cannot continue to operate structures that were designed for six member states and were then tinkered with to cater for nine countries. The structures were never really changed to cope with 12 or 15 states, and we are now looking at 25 plus. It just cannot go on.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Taoiseach told us that was what the Nice referendum was about.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Nice made a few changes on the side just to get us to deal with the larger Union, but it has not dealt fundamentally with the role that Europe plays today. Europe cannot continue like that. By the end of this decade, the European Union will comprise 30 countries. Whether people like it or not, they will have to introduce structures to deal with such a Union in future, otherwise Europe will get into huge difficulties over the next five years. Everybody knows that.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Is it only a matter of structures?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The issues concern who has the powers, how decisions are made, and how structures will operate. All the matters that were in the European Constitution must be dealt with one way or another, whether through a working document or in some other way, otherwise it will not be possible to continue. Even though, as I believe, this could drag on until 2007 or 2008, it will still have to be dealt with. I have made that point clear in the European Council and I will continue to argue that we must find a mechanism for doing it.Perhaps, in the first place, the best mechanism for doing it was not via a constitution, but others saw it differently. Some of the people who fought for that constitution five or six years ago are already beginning to advocate other ways around it. Perhaps it would have been better if they had thought about that before they pushed everyone into a convention some years ago. However, that is how these matters work. Six or seven years have passed but the issues remain to be dealt with because it is not possible to drop them. One can call the methodology whatever one wishes, but the treaty changes to modernise the Union will have to happen.

It produced a comprehensive report and I know the Taoiseach wanted us to expedite that work. The recommendation was that there was no need to change the Constitution in this regard. So far, however, there is nothing in the legislative programme on this matter, so does the Taoiseach intend to bring forward legislation in that area?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I would be glad to answer that point. The recommendation in the all-party committee's report was that it does not require legislation. There is a strong argument about that and I have spoken to more than one senior counsel about the issue. Their view is that if one tries to do so, it will be challenged. The Department is now proceeding to examine the matter on a legislative basis and is reflecting on it. I should let the Department come forward but my view, having spoken to a number of senior counsels, is that when one tries to finalise the legislation it could be quite difficult. I spent a lot of time corresponding with senior counsels on this matter and they said that when we try to do it, it will prove to be very difficult. However, the Department is currently trying to do it on a legislative basis. Apart from all the work we are doing on initiatives, including affordable housing, if we can do it through legislation well and good, but I fear people will try to challenge it. The Department has now decided to try to follow the advice and do it through legislation.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The net point here is that no action has been taken. The relevance of Deputy O'Sullivan's question is that it was the same Taoiseach who used the Constitution for about four years to explain why he could not intervene in the cost of building land because he feared that a constitutional amendment might be necessary. It was then put to the all-party committee——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	114	He is not referring to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He should tell him that notwithstanding what Deputy O'Sullivan and her colleagues have concluded that they think a challenge would be likely. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his patience. My question is which will it be? If the Taoiseach expects a challenge, why does he not introduce an amendment that secures the position? If on the other hand no such amendment to the Constitution is necessary, when will we see legislative action? The damage has been done in the past ten years with the constant spiralling of house prices——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I already answered Deputy O'Sullivan on the matter. I stated that the Department is proceeding with the legislation. I cannot give a date for that legislation. I do not accept the other point. There has been an enormous range of initiatives on affordable land allowing for affordable housing. What was achieved in the Supreme Court judgment on Part V three or four years ago has allowed significant changes to take place. I hope we can make further ground on this issue. If Deputy Rabbitte believes that on private property rights we would be able to go in and just force the price of land down in a way that goes against the market then there would be a challenge. It will not happen like that and that is the point the legal people make.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, together.My next meeting with the Ireland-America economic advisory board has not yet been scheduled but I hope to hold a meeting with the board in the course of a future visit to the United States. It has been the practice for the past number of years to meet the board during the course of my annual visit to Washington over the St. Patrick's Day period.My Department maintains contact with the board primarily through our embassy in Washington, as well as through annual visits and meetings. As the House will be aware, board members give voluntarily of their time and expertise in a number of ways. I see an important future role for the advisory board. The board provides a structure through which the thinking of the most senior and successful leaders of corporate Irish-America can be conveyed directly, and at the highest level, to Government. The board also constitutes an important resource upon which the Government can draw, as required, for strategic investment advice, including personalised access to key contacts.Since its establishment, there have been many positive results, both formal and informal, including providing advice on issues such as branding Ireland in the US, helping with important investment projects and securing a deeper involvement on the part of corporate America in Irish affairs. Board members play important but discreet roles in promoting Ireland's interests and in assisting the Government and State agencies such as IDA Ireland.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Does anybody brief the Ireland-America economic advisory board on ongoing developments in the Northern Ireland peace process? Are members of the board updated by embassy officials or a member of the Cabinet? Do members of the board concentrate on bringing some of the more innovative persons involved in industry in the United States to Ireland to see how the country has changed and how it could be attractive for them to locate and invest here? It is becoming perfectly obvious that Ireland needs to invest in innovation, research and patenting, as they will provide the jobs for the next generation. Given the state of play in America this is critical. For instance many of our universities lose out in terms of the packages available for lectureships in faculties in American universities. If it becomes a magnet for that kind of academic research and innovation then Ireland as a country with a proud base in education and a great deal of bright young people will lose out.While the Ireland-America economic advisory board has played an important part and in its own way has brought about investment here, does the Taoiseach see it moving to a different stage in future given where we are in the competitiveness league and given the future requirements for job creation in Ireland? Does the Taoiseach envisage a different role for the board from what it was established to do?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I have dealt with the advisory board on and off as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach. Its role changes all the time. The embassy primarily recruits new members from Irish-Americans or Irish people who come to its notice and who are prepared to help. The members of the board are briefed regularly on Northern Ireland. They were in Ireland approximately one year ago when they met a number of Ministers and agencies. They keep in regular contact with IDA Ireland and Forfás. At a meeting, which I believe took place last year, in America, Dr. Bill Harris of Science Foundation Ireland spoke on the topic mentioned by the Deputy.In the national development plan we are spending €2.5 billion on research and development. A decade ago the country spent practically nothing on research and development. I am very conscious of the Deputy's point. Most foreign direct investment we get and will continue to get comes from the United States. In the areas of biopharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and in the related information communication technologies our American investments are key. A number of people associated with the Ireland-America economic advisory board are key people — presidents and vice-presidents — in organisations which are immensely helpful to us. The Wyeth organisation has been immensely helpful to us, not only in its investment here but also in other investments.As the Deputy will know many of the resources given to Irish universities by one particular organisation have been from a very strong member of the economic advisory board. The next meeting will be attended by one if not more of the university presidents, who will talk on some of the issues the Deputy mentioned to the economic advisory board. Not only do they have the knowledge of this matter, but many of the people they employ would be very helpful in this matter. At every turn we try to get more of them to come here. Many of the members even on their own time go out of their way when they are here on holidays to meet the agencies. So while it works well, I am always open to try to improve it. Perhaps a new group of people is coming forward — those who emigrated to America in the 1980s. This group could be very helpful in securing foreign direct investment for the future.

Does it address general proposals on inward investment from the United States to this country or does it also address individual cases either being sought, pending or in the process of establishing in this economy? Regarding general proposals, does the Taoiseach seek to ensure a State-wide presentation of the potential and opportunities our economy offers to inward investors from the United States? Does he endeavour to address the imbalance between the south and east of the island, and the Border midlands and west region? The Taoiseach will appreciate that a significant imbalance exists. Counties such as Donegal have been devastated recently by specific manufacturing job losses. My county and that of the Ceann Comhairle is virtually a blank page when it comes to inward investment with a couple of honourable exceptions. Does the Taoiseach make the case for the whole country and endeavour to encourage potential inward investors to look at the opportunities which all parts of the island offer?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The Deputy will appreciate that these meetings are meant to encourage people to invest in the island of Ireland and to look at an all-Ireland economy. We try to sell the attractiveness of Ireland. After that, it is the job of the IDA and Forfás to bring people on site visits. Normally we are trying to draw investors who might be considering other locations, increasingly Singapore or Bangalore. That is the challenge today. The IDA has experience in this area over many years and, for example, brought in the presidents of a number of organisations during September. Increasingly we are fighting to attract businesses considering locating outside Europe. A great many new investments are now being made in Bangalore or China, in particular two regions in China, and in Singapore. This is the opposition we have faced while chasing the most recent five or six major projects. We are rarely competing now against another European partner. Generally, therefore, my presentations would be largely kept to the national area, while the IDA for example would follow up.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."This Bill has two key objectives. First, it puts in place a statutory framework within which I will implement an active, managed economic migration policy, the details of which I am announcing to the House today. The three pillars of this employment permit policy will be green cards, an intra-company transfer scheme and a revised work permits system. Second, it provides a number of new important protections for migrant workers working in Ireland.Before dealing with these two key objectives and going on to describe the sections of the Bill in detail, I wish first to put the Bill in context in terms of our economic and labour market situation. Obviously, economic migration policy must be responsive to different stages of economic development and to labour market conditions. We can be satisfied that our economic migration policy to date has been responsive in this way. During the past ten years, for example, Ireland has been transformed from being primarily a country of emigration, or outward migration, to a country of immigration, or inward migration. During the late 1980s as many as 65,000 people left Ireland each year. This has changed so much that in the year to April 2005, the same number migrated into Ireland.Economic migration policy responded quickly to the improvement in our economic performance, the fall in unemployment and the resultant labour shortages. As a consequence, the number of work permits issued increased dramatically from slightly less than 6,000 in 1999 to close to 48,000 in 2003. When the new ten member states joined the EU, as a significant mark of solidarity with our new EU partners and in recognition of the tightness of our labour market, the Government decided to grant freedom of movement to nationals from these states from the date of accession on 1 May 2004. This has had a major impact on the number of work permits being granted. In the nine months to the end of September, a total of 20,400 permits were issued, of which just 6,000 were new permits. In the year 2000 we also introduced the work visa-work authorisation system to deal with skills shortages among highly skilled occupations in the information and communications technology, construction and health sectors, in particular. Last year 1,500 of these permits were issued.There is now great diversity in our labour force. Nationals from more than 100 countries work here and between 1999 and 2005 the number working here rose from 3.7% to 8%, or about 160,000, of the total labour force. Therefore, so far our work permit policy has served the needs of the economy well and has reacted flexibly and successfully to the requirements and changes in our labour force. This Bill is another response to our skills and labour force needs.The Employment Permits Bill puts in place a statutory framework for an active, managed economic migration policy. The economic policy context for this was set out in the enterprise strategy group report and the Government's action plan to implement it. Both the report and the action plan had as their objective the moving of the economy to a position where it is both knowledge-based and innovation driven.Labour market policy measures are a key part of the objective in three ways. First, we must continue to upskill our own workforce and the One Step Up initiative, which I launched last month, will be crucial. This €35 million initiative, being implemented by FÁS, will upskill our workforce through a process of life long learning. It focuses in particular on lower skilled workers in SMEs as that is where the most need lies.Second, we must maximise the potential for European Economic Area nationals to fill most of our skills deficits. We are now part of a labour market of 200 million workers who have free access to our relatively small labour market of 2 million. We are obliged as EU members to have regard for Community preference in meeting our labour market needs. Many citizens from the ten new European Union member states have already come to work in Ireland. It is estimated that over 90,000 of them have come to work here at some stage since January 2004.There is no doubt that appropriate EEA workers are available to fill most of our skills shortages. The Forfás expert group on future skills needs came to this conclusion in its report entitled, Skills Needs in the Irish Economy: the Role of Migration, which it will publish later this month. I am arranging to supply draft copies of the report to the Opposition spokespersons. I did not wish to delay the passage of the Bill.However, there are skills shortages which cannot be sourced other than through economic migration. This the reason the third key labour market policy measure to move our economy to one that is both innovation-driven and knowledge-based is the development of a strategic skills-based immigration policy to which the enterprise strategy group report specifically referred to and which this Bill will allow me to implement.The focus of this policy will be to efficiently and effectively import those skills which are required to quickly move our economy onto a new plane but which cannot be sourced either within Ireland or the EEA. The strategic skills-based immigration policy that I am announcing today has taken into account the views of the Forfás expert group on future skills needs as expressed in its report.The expert group report referred to the economic arguments that a migration policy which targets individuals possessing high level or scarce skills can have a significantly positive impact on economic performance, on GDP per capita and productivity, particularly when company-specific skills are required. I regard these arguments as compelling and they have informed the policy I am announcing today. I thank the expert group on future skills needs for its work in this area which has been a very useful input to policy.Our economic migration policy will be vacancy-driven rather than based on quotas or points. The core of the policy is the offer of a job. In this way our employment permits policy will be both more responsive and more efficient in responding to the needs of the labour market. Our system will be simple and transparent rather than complex and bureaucratic. We will avoid the complexities and inefficiencies involved in points and quota systems. The expert skills group report also favoured this approach.The new employment permits system, which it is my intention to introduce next year, has three pillars. Pillar one is the establishment for the first time in Ireland of a green card for occupations where there are skills shortages. This will be for a restricted list of occupations in the annual salary range from €30,000 to €60,000 and for a more extensive list of occupations in the annual salary range above €60,000. Pillar two is a re-established intra-company transfer scheme for temporary trans-national management transfers. Pillar three is a work permit scheme for a very restricted list of occupations up to €30,000, where the shortage is one of labour rather than skills. These three pillars will be the means of implementing an actively managed economic migration policy.This Bill provides a framework within which I have the flexibility to adapt and use different migration policy instruments based on different criteria, as necessary. I will keep the implementation of the current set of policy instruments under review and will adapt them as necessary as the economy and the labour market continue to change. In doing so we will take on board the lessons learned by other countries, including the integration issues raised by the experience in those countries. I am aware the International Organisation for Migration will in the coming months produce a report on the economic and social implications of migration to Ireland, which has been commissioned by the National Economic and Social Council. I look forward to considering its findings.The green card system will be for occupations where there are high level or strategic skills shortages. I will cite the key features of this new green card system. First, where the annual salary, excluding bonuses, on offer is in excess of €60,000, which is twice the average industrial wage, the green card will be available for an extensive list of occupations. It will also be available in the annual salary range from €30,000 to €60,000, which is between the average industrial wage and twice that level, for a restricted number of occupations where skills shortages are being experienced. These occupations will be identified following advice from the expert group and will be reviewed on a regular basis.There are two reasons for using salary thresholds in this way. First, in many cases high pay is a reasonable proxy for high skills and this has been demonstrated by the current work visa-work authorisation scheme. Second, salary levels provide some assurance that these workers can provide for their families here without State assistance.The expert group report has already given very firm indications of the sectors and occupations in question. The report refers to skills shortages in the information and communications technology, healthcare and construction sectors to which the current work visa-work authorisation scheme applies. The report also includes other sectors such as construction, financial services, engineering, pharmaceutical, and sales and marketing.In the allocation of green cards, regard will also be had to the skills, qualifications and experience of the workers. The number of green cards will be kept under constant review to ensure that it is not excessive, given the small size of our labour market.The second key feature of the system is that green cards will be issued for two years initially, with the possibility of permanent or long-term residence after that. Third, green card holders will be permitted to bring their spouses and families to join them immediately and their spouses will have the right to work without a work permit.With the implementation of this new green card system the existing work visa-work authorisation system, which has addressed our needs in this area until now, will be discontinued. The new green card will ensure that we can attract and retain the skills we need to move our economy to one based on innovation and knowledge.The second pillar of our new employment permit system is the re-establishment of the intra-company transfer scheme. This scheme is strictly for temporary management level transfers within a company or group of companies and will allow for the temporary transfer of key management staff from overseas companies to offices in Ireland for a period of up to five years. This scheme will bring Ireland into line with current best international practice.The third pillar of our system will be a revised work permits system in which work permits will be required to be applied for in respect of both those occupations in the annual salary range from €30,000 to €60,000 for which green cards will not be issued and a limited number of occupations below an annual salary of €30,000 where there are significant labour shortages; these occupations will be identified following advice from the expert group on future skills needs. In both cases a labour market test, including advertisements in the national or local press showing that the positions could not be filled from within the EEA, will need to be met. Work permits will be granted first for a period of two years, followed by a further period of three years. The fee will be the same as now, €500 per annum, in other words, €1,000 for the first two-year period, and €1,500 for the following three-year period.The other key objective of this Bill is the provision of a number of new important protections for migrant workers. These include the granting of both the employment permit — whether the work permit or the green card — to the employee, rather than to the employer. The Bill allows both the employee and the employer to apply for an employment permit, whether it be a work permit or a green card, based on an offer of employment. I expect that initially the employer will continue to apply for the work permit. This will facilitate the enforcement of employees' rights and traceability.The employment permit will contain a statement of the rights and entitlements of the migrant worker, including that the employee may change employment through the application for another permit by a new employer. This will provide migrant workers with greater freedom and flexibility. The Bill prohibits employers from deducting from remuneration any expenses associated with recruitment and from retaining personal documents belonging to the employee. The Bill will introduce significant penalties for breaches of the legislation, comprising fines to a maximum of €50,000 or terms of imprisonment not exceeding five years.Following my announcement on 12 April 2005, 31 inspector posts have been sanctioned for the labour inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of inspectorate personnel in the last 12 months and is indicative of my determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation. It is important to stress that the labour inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality, as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.There are currently 20 officers serving in inspector posts and, following a competitive interview procedure, a further 11 officers will be appointed. I anticipate this entire process being completed at the end of this month or very soon afterwards. However, the breadth and complexity of the inspectorate's remit is such that considerable training is required. Initially, much of this training is undertaken in the company of an experienced officer who will take time to explain the issues at hand and assist the trainee inspector in developing the skills and confidence necessary to take on tasks alone. A new initiative in this regard is the assignment of an officer to oversee and manage the training and development process in respect of this significant influx of new officers to duties in the inspectorate.When these officers are fully operational they will be concentrating on those employment sectors that have traditionally required considerable attention from the inspectorate. These would include the construction sector and the services sectors that are covered by employment regulation orders such as hospitality, cleaning and agricultural work. It is notable that many migrant workers are currently employed in these sectors.Apart from the strengthening of staff resources, other initiatives are also under way. Arising from a commitment in Sustaining Progress, and in order to assist in the preparation of proposals for consideration by Government, a discussion document was prepared by the labour inspectorate concerning its mandate and resourcing. This comprehensive discussion document was prepared and circulated to the social partners in January of this year.The document covered the full dimension of issues that impact on the operation of the labour inspectorate ranging from the legislative framework right through to operational issues and staff development. The discussion document looked at a range of possibilities around the operation of the inspectorate and offered a spectrum of options ranging from a compliance regime where the initiative would move more toward the aggrieved employee, with the labour inspectorate offering support, to a model where the right of initiative would essentially remain with the inspectorate which would continue to adopt a hands-on approach.The discussion document is not prescriptive but seeks to present both sides of the argument on an extensive range of issues impacting on the mandate and associated resourcing of the labour inspectorate, together with its linked business units. The primary purpose of the document is to stimulate debate and to signal that fundamental changes in the approach to the enforcement of employment rights compliance should be considered.The document has been well received among the social partners and the parties are now well advanced in their consideration of the more than 40 proposals on the agenda. The objective is to formulate a set of recommendations for Government arising from the various possibilities presented in the discussion document. The issues being discussed include concerns expressed by the social partners and other Departments. It is intended this process will feed into and complement the up-coming discussions in the context of the negotiations of a new national social partnership agreement.A proposal of particular interest is that a strategic programme of education and information dissemination on employment rights be undertaken from early next year. It is intended that all general communications media will be utilised in order to underpin message delivery to the respective target audiences. The programme will embrace the demand to target messages to workers in specific sectors and to meet the challenge of informing people who do not have sufficient English for it to be an effective working language for them.I will now describe the details of the Bill's provisions section by section. Section 1 provides definitions for certain terms used throughout the Bill. In addition, subsections (2) and (3) cover the circumstances under which a recognised employment agency enters into a contract with a person to work or perform a service for a third party. Effectively, employment agencies may not apply for an employment permit on behalf of a third party. Section 2 amends section 2 of the Employment Permits Act 2003 to allow the employment of non-nationals in accordance with the provisions of section 7.Sections 3 to 6 state the various conditions under which an application for an employment permit can be made. In particular, section 3 provides for the making of an application and outlines the four categories of persons who may apply for an employment permit under this Bill, namely, an employer in the State, non-national, a foreign contractual service supplier, and any other person party to the employment of a non-national in the State. Section 4 provides that all employment permits are granted to the non-national employee, irrespective of who applies for the permit. This is one of the more significant changes that the Bill proposes. Work permits are currently issued to the employer but granting them to the employee will increase the power of migrant workers in the employment relationship. Section 5 specifies the information to be provided in an application for a permit other than by a non-national, that is, applications by employers. The information required mirrors existing specifications with regard to work permit applications. It ensures the proposed non-national candidate has the necessary skills, qualifications and-or experience for the position and that the position is of a nature that requires it to be filled by a non-national. Section 6 specifies the information to be provided in an application for a permit by a non-national, that is, in applications for green cards by non-national employees. This information is currently required to be provided by applicants for a work visa or work authorisation, which is the precursor of the green card.Section 7 provides for the granting of employment permits by the Minister. This is a fundamental part of the employment permit process which, until now, has not been provided for in legislation. It provides for the granting, by regulation, of permits of unlimited duration to non-national applicants, effectively allowing the establishment of the green card system.Section 8 provides for the issuing of employment permits granted under section 7 and provides for particular information to be stated on the permit. An employment permit granted under section 7 shall be issued to the non-national employee. Where the application was made by the employer, a copy of the permit will be issued to him or her. Information relating to the rights and entitlements of migrant workers, including their remuneration and a statement of the national minimum wage, the right to change employers and the prohibitions set out in section 22, will be stated on the permit. As I said earlier, these new provisions will increase the awareness of employment rights among migrant workers and will increase their power in the employment relationship.The provisions of section 9 are designed to meet our EU Treaty Community preference obligations not to grant an employment permit unless it has been offered to EU nationals first. Section 10 stipulates further conditions for consideration when granting of work permits including ascertaining the legitimacy of applications for employment permits, the economic policy of the Government at the time and the terms of any regulations in force with regard to the granting of employment permits.Section 11 outlines the conditions for refusal to grant an employment permit and the procedures to be applied when an application has been refused, while section 12 provides for review procedures in the case of a decision to refuse to grant an employment permit under section 10.Section 13 deals with the making of regulations governing the granting and renewal of employment permits, including limiting the number of permits granted, the categories of employment and qualifications or skills and the period covered by the permit. This section together with section 14 enables the Minister to monitor and adjust the employment permits system in line with prevailing economic conditions. Section 14 specifies the criteria that must be observed when making regulations under section 13. These criteria relate to economic and social development and competitiveness in the State.Section 15 lays down the conditions under which the Minister may revoke an employment permit and sets out the conditions that determine at what stage the revocation will take place while section 16 provides the conditions under which a decision to revoke an employment permit may be submitted to the Minister. The conditions of section 16 largely mirror those outlined under section 12, which deals with the review of the decision to refuse to grant a permit.Sections 17 to 18 describe various misuses of employment permits that are prohibited and provide that persons in contradiction of these provisions are guilty of an offence. Such misuses include forgery and fraudulent use, alteration of employment permits or illegal transfer of permits.Section 19 provides for the renewal of employment permits in various circumstances. A significant aspect of this section is its provision to allow the renewal by regulation of permits of unlimited duration to non-national applicants, that is, to green card applicants. This, in effect, grants the right of permanent residency to them. Applicants must confirm that they have complied with the terms of the permit and of this Act up to the point of application for renewal, if deemed necessary. As is the current practice, it is not necessary for them to undertake a labour market test to ensure that the skills deemed necessary for the employment cannot be sourced locally.Section 20 allows for the cessation and reinstatement of employment permits while section 21 provides for the appointment and conditions of officers authorised for the purposes of the Act. In practice, the Garda national immigration bureau enforces the law with regard to illegal working. The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for the monitoring and enforcement of rights, protections and entitlements under employment protection legislation.Section 22 provides additional statutory protection for migrant workers, including prohibiting employers from either deducting recruitment expenses from remuneration or from retaining workers' personal documents, including passports. Any employer who contravenes any of the provisions of this section is guilty of an offence.Section 23 provides for the circumstances pertaining to the surrender of an employment permit, namely that the holder is obliged to return the permit to my Department within four weeks of the date the employment ceased. Section 24 relates to the provision of false or misleading information, which is an offence. Under section 25 employers are obliged to retain, make available and furnish to an authorised officer, if requested, books, records and accounts concerning a non-national employee. A person who contravenes this section is guilty of an offence.Section 26 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a register of employment permits granted under the Act. This information is already recorded by my Department. Section 27 enables the Minister to make regulations to govern the procedures for the application for, and renewal of, an employment permit. This section deals primarily with administrative matters.Section 28 provides for the making of regulations on a range of issues referred to in the Act and provides for their laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas while section 29 provides for the serving of notices and their requirements.Section 30 provides for penalties and proceedings with regard to offences committed under this Bill. On conviction for an offence under this Bill a person may be liable for a fine from €5,000 up to €50,000 and-or imprisonment for a period from 12 months up to five years. Section 31 qualifies section 30 by setting out a standard provision regarding offences by corporate bodies and places responsibility for such offences on individuals, where appropriate.Sections 32 to 36 provide for the delegation of certain functions to officers, transitional arrangements for permits currently in force, aligns the definition of non-national to conform with the definition in section 1 of the Immigration Act 1999, provides sanction for the expenditure incurred in the implementation of this Act and the preliminaries common to all legislation.Since the publication of the Bill last June, the Forfás expert group on future skills needs has completed its work and its report will be published in the near future. In order to take account of its findings, the Bill as published will require some amendments, which I will bring forward on Committee Stage. The amendments will also include one to cover whistleblowers, to facilitate those who wish to expose illegalities under this legislation.There is no doubt that the successful performance of the Irish economy over recent years in terms of growth and job creation has been phenomenal. There is equally no doubt that in order to sustain economic growth going forward, we must ensure we position our economy as one that is both knowledge-based and innovation-driven. To do this requires labour force policy action on three fronts. The first priority is to up-skill our own workforce. We must also maximise the potential for European Economic Area nationals to fill most of our skills deficits from the EU labour force of 200 million. Finally, we must supplement these actions with the efficient, flexible, strategic, managed and skills-based immigration policy I have announced today. This is a key part of our policy that will enable us to meet any deficits we have for high level and strategic skills.The Bill also increases our protection of migrant workers in a number of key respects. It is essential that workers from abroad enjoy the same rights and protections as Irish national workers. Together these twin elements of the Bill will ensure that our economy and labour market will continue to be successful, sustainable and fair. I commend the Bill to the House.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	199	This Bill has been a long time in gestation. Much of it was conjured up because there is no immigration policy here. Despite a future skills needs evaluation being carried out by the Minister's Department through Forfás, I expected he would have had access to the research being carried out by the National Economic and Social Council before coming to this House with the type of sustaining influences required to provide an Employment Permits Act, which will give transparency to the workers who are currently in this jurisdiction and those who will come here in the future.Ireland missed out on the last industrial revolution. The strength of the Irish economy in recent years indicates that the Celtic tiger is still going well. Employment is good, the level of unemployment is low and the skills needs for the economy in the future are an important factor. A study by the Minister's Department will highlight a number of areas of our economic activity that will require a significant level of skills to be brought into this jurisdiction. These are in a wide variety of areas, which is why I would like to know why are we so stringent in regard to the financial or wage parameters to which the Minister referred in one of his pillars in respect of the green card system. This system may have to be flexible and reviewed on a regular basis if we are to meet the skills shortages in engineering, pharmaceuticals and across a wide variety of employment opportunities where companies cannot fill the level of skills currently required. It is a tremendous change from the type of Ireland we had in the previous century when people had to emigrate to build up the economies of other jurisdictions. As that trend is now in reverse, we must find a mechanism through the employment permits system whereby we welcome overseas workers and ensure they have the same protections as Irish employees in this jurisdiction.Study after study indicates the severe difficulties in finding the right people for the right jobs. This includes in areas such as finance, the leisure industry, health care and within management in the retail sector. Many migrant workers are employed in the hospitality sector. We are all aware that the vast majority of people who work in restaurants and hotels on the lower wages are non-nationals. This trend is likely to continue and we do not want to see exploitation of the situation for the benefit of reducing costs for employers because these workers are making a contribution to the economy and to the sector in which they are employed.The legal framework whereby workers could come into this country has been unclear for a long time. This is as a result of not having a proper immigration policy. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been slow to have an open and transparent debate in this House or elsewhere to discover the reasons we need to have workers, where are the skills shortages in the various parts of the economy and how can we come up with a system that is less harsh than has been the case up to now. I hear much criticism from time to time in regard to work visas and work permits in that some individuals who genuinely want to make a contribution to the economy are being harshly treated. The process by which these applications are processed is very slow. We must be more responsive if we are to have a continuation of migrant workers into this country. No one doubts that there must be rules. The green card system is an initiative to give us some semblance of rules to deal with the matter, with which I will deal later.Prior to the last election the attitude of the some backbenchers and members of the Government, which have been toned down recently, was less than satisfactory in regard to the base instincts of some people to migrant workers. Since the last election, a Minister of State referred to people as "kebabs", for which he was not punished. This type of attitude cannot be tolerated if we want to welcome people into this country to make a contribution to our future economic development. We cannot stand idly by and allow these racist remarks or xenophobia to increase. In the recent case of Irish Ferries, there was a temptation on the part of some people who, for one reason or another, were being displaced as local domestic and indigenous employees by foreign workers, to build up some resentment towards these workers, which is the last thing we want. The State should provide an education and information programme which is up-front in regard to the need for these workers to ensure there is a major economic drive in the country in the years ahead.It is important to base employment forecasts on population forecasts. It is worth reflecting on the statistical analysis of Mr. Aidan Punch of the CSO, who recently commented that the Republic's population is expected to increase from the current level of just over four million to 5.5 million by 2030, which is a huge increase. He went on to say in his speech to the Magill Summer School that births are projected to average around 63,300 annually, with deaths averaging 32,400, leading to an annual natural increase in population of 30,900. However, migration is projected to differ markedly from that experienced in the past. Part of the reason for so many shortages in various sectors of the economy is that we have not planned for it. There is a significant dearth of forward planning across a wide variety of sectors in the economy, not least in terms of employment projection. We have known for several years that this would be a problem, and we have reached the 11th hour again before to dealing with the issue. We have experienced the need for and enrichment of certain categories of migrant workers. The transparency they are creating through the proposal for the green card system is to be welcomed.When the Bill was published, the Minister stated that in regard to work permits, the legislation will enable the Minister, every two years, to set the maximum number of employment permits to be issued both in total and by sector, to identify the skills and qualifications required for the grant of a permit, and to identify the categories of employment that may or may not be the subject of granting employment permits. I agree with that statement and Fine Gael welcomes the provision. The more information there is in regard to that statement on the publication of the Bill, the more people will understand why there are so many migrant workers walking around our towns and villages and why they are needed in certain sectors of the economy.The Bill allows for the creation of a green card system. The Minister stated that the practice of employers applying for the permit will continue. I am open to debate on this issue. In the past, the practice of giving a work permit to an employer was open to exploitation.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	201	While the Bill deals with the matter, employers are still being given an opportunity to seek a work permit. This matter should be examined on Committee Stage. Employers, notwithstanding their bona fides when applying for work permits, are tempted to exploit that opportunity. There is more opportunity for labour mobility if the employee is the custodian of the work permit, notwithstanding the strict rules governing work permits.The legislation outlines the process an employee must go through to obtain a work permit under the green card system. We should examine this issue on Committee Stage. A green card is defined as "an identity document issued by a country's authorities affording non-citizens a number of the rights its citizens enjoy sometimes with the prospect of naturalisation". An example is the United States permanent resident card. Ireland could follow this example but make it employee rather than employer-based.Since the publication of the Bill, the Minister has referred to green cards in an effort to suggest his Department has come up with a comprehensive and compassionate answer to the problems faced by migrant workers who keep this economy going. However, the last time I checked, citizens had the right to quit any job they liked and seek another. The same is not true of migrants; they do not have complete freedom in this regard. Different criteria apply to migrants workers and citizens, which should be acknowledged. We will decide on Committee Stage whether the Minister should go further to afford migrant workers more benefits and protections under our employment law. The legislation will make it easier for migrants to move job but an employee-based system should be examined.I welcome the provisions for migrant protection in the legislation. Unfortunately, following the good work of Deputy Joe Higgins and others, we had the recent shocking revelations at GAMA Construction and Irish Ferries. We are going down an unsavoury road where employers may be tempted to indiscriminately dump domestic workers and employ foreign workers at a cheaper rate to reduce their cost base. That is completely at variance with the comments of successive Ministers, including the current Minister, about going up the value chain. Sean Dorgan, chief executive officer of the IDA, regularly states we are going up the value chain but the issues raised within these companies suggests we are going down the sewer regarding employment law and practice. These issues must be explored to prevent worker exploitation.I acknowledge the Minister increased the number of inspectors attached to the labour inspectorate following these revelations and good enforcement is important. Deputy Howlin and I attended a committee meeting earlier at which the Association of Electrical Contractors made a presentation. It seldom happens that an august umbrella body representing employers informs a committee about how the Government is being ripped off, as legitimate contractors are being undercut by non-compliant contractors operating in a black market. Local authorities may even be getting in on the act by granting contracts to unscrupulous employers who have not adhered to agreements in place between the Department, employers and unions. The labour inspectorate is crucial, not only in respect of migrant workers but also in respect of other issues in the economy. People are tempted to offer a contact to the person who provides the cheapest quote, irrespective of whether he is compliant, because costs are increasing. Compliance with the legislation will be critical.I refer to the Minister's second pillar, the intra-company transfer scheme. This is a new notion and I am not up to speed with the scheme. However, according to the Minister, it was implemented in the past and he is reintroducing a similar scheme.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I have a little problem with the issue of temporary workers. Ireland has bilateral agreements with a number of countries regarding employees working in this jurisdiction on a temporary basis. In addition, PRSI exemptions are provided under Article 97 of SI 312 of 1996, which is subject to abuse. The scheme is operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I refer to the number of exemptions issued in recent years.For example, GAMA Construction competes for infrastructural projects, particularly roads projects, against domestic companies. In 2002, 290 PRSI exemptions were issued, of which GAMA received 92, while in 2004 603 exemptions issued, of which 347 were awarded to GAMA. Up to the end of May 2005, 313 exemptions had been issued, of which 288 were given to GAMA Construction. This is an abuse. This company is tendering for projects against domestic construction companies but it can use the PRSI exemption to reduce labour costs when submitting the tender. GAMA recently tendered successfully for the Castleblayney road project at a cost of €58 million, but the PRSI exemption could be worth 2% of a saving on the contract for the company, which is a decided advantage for it.If tenders are awarded to companies on the basis of PRSI exemptions, a level playing field must be provided and, therefore, such exemptions should be factored into the tendering process. It is unfair that domestic contractors must compete against a foreign company which is given a 2% advantage in labour costs from the outset. Labour costs account for one third of a contract. Contracts are, therefore, skewed in favour of GAMA Construction. Ironically, at the time the Castleblayney contract was being adjudicated on, the company was under investigation by the Minister's Department. It is not fair, particularly since GAMA was not sanctioned for being up to its neck in labour issues but instead was rewarded with a €58 million contract in Castleblayney and given an advantage in the tendering process though the PRSI exemption granted by another Minister.Does the Minister intend to make more resources available to the labour inspectorate and other bodies which will enforce the legislation? How does the Department intend to communicate these new rights to migrant workers? What mechanism will be used to give them the information? How does the Minister intend to co-operate with foreign embassies in ensuring these rights are translated into meaningful improvements for migrant workers, given the linguistic difficulties involved? A number of interdepartmental initiatives involving the Departments of Education and Science, Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are required to ensure everyone understands our system. It is not desirable that one arm of Government does not know what the other is doing.Our international reputation took another hit last month when the Polish edition of Newsweek reported that Ireland was a living hell for many Poles, who arrived expecting to be able to pick and choose jobs because we are advertising job opportunities and stating we have no workers. Instead the Poles found themselves sleeping rough and living on charity. The Polish Embassy has suggested that around 10,000 Poles living in this country are experiencing difficulty. The astounding thing about this situation is that it is not just the “pinkos”, as the former Minister for Finance would have referred to them, who have highlighted this issue.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I wish to refer to several sections of this Bill. In section 8(2)(c) the Bill requires a statement of requirements under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. A number of workers in the construction industry, the hotel industry and agriculture will be covered under a registered employment agreement or statutory instruments setting out terms and conditions, including wages, of employment. I am anxious that this be done and ask Minister to amend the legislation so that where a collective agreement or a rate of pay and terms and conditions are specified by the statutory instrument, the permit will specify compliance with same. When the permit is issued everything in respect of pay and conditions should be in order. As it is proposed to issue permits on the basis of economic areas, I see no reason this cannot be specified in the work permit.The Minister may also consider the case where a permit has been issued to an employer. In this case the employer should have to specify whether any order has been made under the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to take account of recent high-profile breaches of Industrial Relations Acts. Under that Act the Labour Court has specified rates of pay above the national minimum wage. In addition, an employer should have to specify if any agreement has been agreed with any union designating rates of pay above the national minimum wage.Those bringing claims on behalf of foreign workers find that registered employment agreements or rates of pay specified under statutory instruments of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 that have not been recorded as registered employment agreements are not being followed. Agreements reached, such as higher rates of pay agreed in the Labour Court or through industrial relations, are not being followed in respect of foreign workers. By limiting the reference to the National Minimum Wage Act there may be a number of sectors where the employee believes he or she is only entitled to the minimum wage but may in fact be entitled to more.The timescale referred to in section 16 seems very short. Some 14 days are provided to lodge a submission to review a decision to refuse. This could be increased as obtaining all the information needed to lodge a review might take more than 14 days. A situation similar to that of An Bord Pleanála might be the appropriate timescale, where everyone can avail of 21 or 28 days.The matter of making oral presentations has not been addressed in this section. Could this be possible in the same way there is an oral hearing in the planning process? This may take time and may clog the system but the Minister must take this into account.Section 25 relates to retention of records for work permit applications and also in respect of all foreign workers. In practice, this may create significant difficulties for businesses. In the case of workers that do not require a work permit there would be a significant additional burden on Irish business in complying with rules and regulations. It would mean retaining additional documentation, even for workers who do not normally require a permit. It would mean that an Irish employer employing an English national would have to maintain records under this Act even though a work permit is not required. This is my interpretation of the section. I appreciate that this is relevant in respect of work permits but if it is going to create significant additional and unnecessary costs, EU workers could be made exempt from this provision.In section 27 the amendment to the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	212	It is very important.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	213	——is very important. My legal advisers inform me the amendment is welcome. It would be appropriate to extend this period to 24 months rather than 12 months under section 27. Issues arise outside the 12-month period and many of these will involve matters of fact rather than recollection. Limiting cases to those where the complaint has been made within 12 months will limit the number of prosecutions that can be made. Often issues will only arise after civil proceedings have been completed and the matter comes to the attention of the Department. Currently, a case before the Equality Tribunal must be brought before six months and the hearing date is unlikely to take place within six months. In this case the Department may not receive a report nor have the matter referred to it until 12 months have elapsed. The timescale is too short and I urge the Minister to examine this before Committee Stage.I give a general welcome to the legislation brought before the House today. I look forward to Committee Stage where we can work towards achieving a balance between bringing people here on a transparent basis, ensuring their integration into society, and avoiding abuse by the employer that is a temptation at present. Irish society should welcome these migrant workers as part of our community and the contribution they can legitimately make to the growth of the economy.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	214	This Bill is particularly suited to Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will provide for adequate time to deal with a range of complex issues. I hope he will approach the debate on Committee Stage with an open mind. In my short contribution I hope to deal in a philosophical way with issues that are important for us as a nation. We have been tardy in the way we have approached issues that are germane to this Bill but go beyond its scope and involve other Departments. It is time we had this debate in a joined-up fashion and I hope the Minister is open-minded in respect of this and can communicate with his colleagues. We must seek to construct a framework that goes beyond the economic needs of Ireland and considers how Irish society is to be constructed in a coherent way.In June I welcomed the belated publication of the Employment Permits Bill, one that had been promised by the Minister's predecessor for publication prior to Easter 2003. It has been a long time coming and one would expect a radical Bill after such a period of gestation. I do not consider this Bill particularly radical and it could have been produced long before now.It is legislation that is urgently needed as Ireland's employment structure and base has changed beyond recognition, as the Minister outlined in his contribution. The delay in producing an appropriate legislative framework to address the changing nature of Ireland's employment structure and the relatively new phenomenon of significant non-national migration into this State has had real consequences. We must recognise that. As the Government dithered and delayed, the exploitation of some foreign workers by a minority of ruthless employers was allowed continue without interruption. There was some interruption when particularly notorious cases were pointed out, not necessarily by the inspectorate employed by the Minister or his Department but often by vigilant trade unionists or, at least on one occasion, vigilant Members of this House.For years there has been a recognition by many that our current work permit system is unfair and unreasonable. Like so many millions of Irish through the decades, it has condemned many foreign workers who have come to these shores to seek a better economic situation for themselves to a form of bonded labour that we would have deplored had it been inflicted upon Irish nationals elsewhere. There is a certain irony, as other Members pointed out, in the fact that last week in this House and this week in the other House a motion was debated commending a legislative measure currently going through the Congress in the United States to deal with the undocumented Irish while we have allowed a situation to exist in our jurisdiction where many decent, hard working people who have come to this land for no better reason than to improve their economic circumstances and those of their families have been dealt with, to put it at its mildest, in a shabby fashion.The inability of the Minister's Department to properly monitor workplace conditions and terms of employment has been starkly revealed in some recent high profile cases. Regardless of what the Minister says, it is abundantly clear that the labour inspectorate charged with monitoring workplace conditions and ensuring the laws we enact in these Houses that govern workers and their rights and entitlements is inadequate and under-equipped to monitor 2 million workers in a complex and changing social and legal environment.The facts speak for themselves. Despite the huge influx of foreign workers over recent times and the evidence that has been presented of systematic exploitation, the number of inspections carried out by the labour inspectorate declined from 8,323 in 2002 to 5,160 in 2004. The number of prosecutions in the same period fell from 25 to 14. We are going backwards in terms of our ability to monitor and ensure that workers, both domestic and non-national, are afforded the full protection of law. We can enact the best legislation possible in these Houses but it is meaningless if employers, or at least a minority of employers, believe they can get away with that. Unfortunately, in a workforce of 2 million the chances are that they can, and we have seen concrete evidence of that. As Deputy Hogan rightly said, this morning at a meeting of the joint committee the Electrical Contractors of Ireland made it clear to the committee that they have the gravest concerns at the ability of the labour inspectorate to monitor their industry, one of many.Another issue I had not heard before but I put it on the agenda for the Minister is that the volume of cases now coming before the Labour Court will mean the Labour Court itself will become moribund and clogged with cases and will not work efficiently into the future. I will be anxious to have a clear reassurance from the Minister that that is not the case and that the resources and capacity of the Labour Court, as well as his own labour inspectorate, will be expanded to ensure the vigorous nature of Irish law is fully enacted at ground level to ensure we will not have a recurrence of some of the high profile abuses we have witnessed recently.In this contribution I want to deal in general terms with our position now and what we want to achieve in a society, and I would welcome the Minister's reflections on that. By way of background, we must ask what we want to achieve in terms of the new labour market and structure of employment in this jurisdiction. Do we want to create a selfish system that allows workers to be brought in who are needed for a finite period to fill a particular gap in terms of the work available here only to discard them as soon as that gap can be filled by domestic workers? Is that the system we want to construct or is it a system that acknowledges the need for non-national workers to grow our economy and wishes to afford such people who choose to come here an opportunity to have a stake in our economy, settle in Ireland and be part of a new developing Irish society? That is a fundamental question and the models exist.In simple terms the Minister has used, in all his press statements since the publication of this Bill, the notion of a green card to which I will return in some detail. The understanding of the green card is the American model. The American model says one can apply to get a green card and have a stake in America, that one has a right to work that is exclusive to one. From that model we have the melting pot of e pluribus unum. People come to that country with their green card with a notion of settling down.A different model has prevailed in some European countries, for example, the German model is the gastarbeiter. Over generations guest workers, as we have seen with the Turks in Germany, have been separate. They never integrated and the societal difficulty that creates for people who feel no stake in the country they and even their parents have lived in is a real dilemma for Germany. We have seen some of that, although not as starkly, even in the United Kingdom where the second generation of migrants who were brought in during the post-war boom period now feel alien in their own land. The issues are being addressed in terms of people searching for new identities from that of their grandparents who believe they have no stake in the country they were brought up in, that they are seen by that society as alien and, despite having been born, bred and educated in that country, are not part of it. These are the models we have to learn from to ensure we do not create in ten, 20, 30 or 40 years' time an Ireland that is fractured. I raise that as a real issue that we must address and get right. It is not simple legislation the Minister is introducing to fill, in some sort of mechanistic, economic system, a gap in the workforce by bringing in people as if they were cogs only to turf them out again when they are no longer needed. That is a difficult, important decision that Ireland must make for our future and for the sort of society we wish to create.The original view expressed by the Tánaiste in answering questions in this House some years ago — I know the Tánaiste's predilection to opt for America over Europe but perhaps she is right in this case — was that she wanted to opt for the American model of the green card. My understanding of that was that we would identify economic need within our society. The Minister has done that and his report on the assessment of need has been sent to me. We should fix in general terms the numbers to be dealt with but the Minister has resiled from that position and is not anxious to work on a quota basis. I ask him to be open at least to debate that issue.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Good. Let us debate that on Committee Stage. There is much in the Bill to discuss on that Stage.There is some merit in the argument that we apply a quota. It is less selfish than saying we will let people in only where the job exists, as opposed to allowing some economic migration into the country. We are a player in the world market and, while I do not wish to sound pejorative, we can share some of the burden of people who want to migrate in here. We could do this in a structured way that is not exclusively defined according to absolute need in our economy. That is a debating point for Committee Stage.I understood green cards would be granted to those people we have identified who applied and would meet the conditions and that allocation would signify a degree of permanence. These people would be allowed to put down roots and have a stake in this society, and not be seen as a "temporary arrangement"— to borrow a phrase — to meet a temporary difficulty. In effect, the Bill puts the current working visa authorisation scheme which is re-presented as a green card system, on a statutory basis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	217	It is more than that.

Permits will be issued and can be renewed on a two year basis. The Minister may then bring in regulations under section 7 to allow "such longer period" as the Minister may determine. Does that afford people the sort of stake in Ireland that is critical to creating the social cohesion we need in the long term?The view of those who have made submissions to me and no doubt also to the Minister is that there will be two categories of migrants under these proposals, determined by income. I would welcome the Minister's comments on this. One category will be regarded as more valuable than another and will have greater entitlements and rights. I am concerned about that. We will await the Minister's clear explanation on Committee Stage but this issue may not be absolutely clear until we see the detailed regulations. I hope the Minister will bring these to the House for debate.We already have the notion that large corporations such as Intel can come and go as they like but there are other categories that must go through a different set of hoops. One example with which we all have grappled in recent years is that of people who have a legitimate entitlement to work here, and on whom we depend, who have difficulty bringing their family members to settle here. The Minister would have direct knowledge of this through his experience of the health services.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	220	That has been addressed for example in respect of nurses. Other issues arise. I have dealt with consultants who are critical to maintaining our health service whose close relatives cannot visit them because the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regards anybody who comes in as wanting to live here.This applies even to people who have clear economic reason to stay where they are but want to visit here. We have a closed mind because we are unused to this situation. We need joined-up thinking in the future if we are to address these issues.My concern is that we will have one category under what the Minister classifies as "green card" and I regard as simply putting on a legislative basis a category that already exists, and a second category that will be regarded as a lesser breed. This raises the issue of ownership of the work permit. The Minister indicated that the work permit can be issued to the individual.Someone who receives a work permit for which his or her employer has applied will depend on the employer to reapply in order to renew that permit. People caught in that second category will encounter all the difficulties with which we grapple on behalf of those already here, namely, impermanence, the inability to open bank accounts, difficulties in getting even medium-term leases and rented accommodation and difficulty taking out loans. We must tease out all these points and get them right.It is not good enough that there is such a gap between Departments. Other Deputies must have encountered the same problems dealing with what I call Burgh Quay, where two Departments are located, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Departments seem to operate independently. It is extremely difficult and frustrating even for a Member of the Oireachtas to deal with them.I could cite cases in which I receive contradictory information from these two Departments. They are not joined up or connected. It is difficult to deal with the issue of visiting relatives. Economically the Minister's Department attracts people who are critical to our economy or services such as the health service but the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a different mind set and attitude and often will not allow the close relatives of these people to visit them on temporary basis often. I have gone through that process many times. I can give the Minister chapter and verse if he is interested.We need to deal with this problem in a structured way. I published a document called Ending the Chaos years ago when we had a significant backlog of asylum cases. Like the Minister's Bill it had three pillars, namely, asylum seekers, economic migrants and integration. They run across Departments but must be dealt with together or we will not find a solution to benefit society.I do not know from where an integration policy will come. Notionally, it should come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has primary responsibility for migration matters. Deputy Hogan referred to a Newsweek article about Polish workers coming here. They are not covered by work permits because they are members of the European Union but many thousands have come and are in all our towns where they are welcome. They are hardworking, enthusiastic and remind us all of the Irish of the past.That article painted a bleak picture. I am not suggesting it is accurate but it is at least partially accurate. It concerns people who have no legal difficulties. Those who will benefit from work permits will have more difficulty because of the qualifications attached to a work permit regime such as we are setting up. We need an integration strategy for the new member states of the European Union that is more developed than the existing one. We need a separate strategy for people who have been invited to work here under the work permits regime that we are fine-tuning through this legislation. It is an area we must address.Public perception is extremely important. We all hear it and sometimes Members play up to it. The fiasco of Irish Ferries, where a company determines that it should "disemploy" Irish workers, in this case substituting eastern Europeans at a fraction of the cost, allows incipient racism to bed down, there is no doubt of that. David Begg of ICTU made a very compelling case and was the first to articulate it in those terms. If we allow the perception to bed down that non-national workers are undercutting the Irish labour force and will take our jobs and work for buttons, there will be chaos. We are sowing the seeds of racism and the worst sort of xenophobia that will result in great societal difficulties. We must grasp that issue very carefully and firmly.I will not go off on a tangent regarding Irish Ferries, an issue unique to the maritime sector, since we can apply Irish law elsewhere. However, as we have seen regarding Gama and other situations, we must have a mechanism to identify all those cases to ensure that does not happen and that we have an agency proactive in explaining to people the need for a flexible labour force, how welcome they are, and that we guarantee to protect current labour law and rights in bringing about economic transformation.I deplore the attitude shown by IBEC to the Irish Ferries dispute, which has played into this and allowed a belief to develop that we will allow the undermining of Irish jobs and pay rates and the advances made by workers over the years. We must be very robust and clear on all sides of the House in explaining time and again the new type of workforce required in this country but that all are welcome at Irish pay rates and that we are determined to enforce Irish law in that regard.The bureaucracy attached to basic matters is incredible. A highly qualified young architect came to me, having been offered a job in this jurisdiction. Since he is from South America, he was told that he must go back to his home country to make the application, although he is already here with the family of his Irish girlfriend. He has something to offer and has a job, yet we want him to return to South America, to a country where Ireland does not have an embassy, so that he can go to a consul general and apply for a work permit that will be submitted to the nearest Irish Embassy, which happens to be in Buenos Aires, to be transmitted to Dublin so that the authorities there can make a determination and send it all back. If that is the level of complexity involved, it is enough to do anyone's head in.The information that I have received from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that he does not have to do that at all. Achieving clarity on the issue, or even checking the website for information, is very difficult. These areas must be reformed, with much closer co-operation between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that people whose skills we need are respected and not belittled by the systems that we put in place.Recently I had a debate on the radio with a well-known economic commentator. I will take the liberty of mentioning that third party, who is robust enough to tolerate it, Mr. Moore McDowell. I was absolutely taken aback by his attitude, which is that what is happening at Irish Ferries is the dislocation of Irish workers by cheaper ones, that it will happen time and again in our economy, and that it is a good development. It is important that we make it clear that it is no such thing and that it will not be tolerated. The Minister must be clear in his discussions with IBEC that he expects it to work in partnership. The consequences are not only very serious for economic development and the maintenance of social partnership but for the maintenance of a structured society with a changed ethnic structure achieved in peace and harmony. Those issues are very serious and not for glib comments to be thrown in from a narrow economic perspective.I welcome section 22 of the Bill, which addressed an issue with which we have dealt as individual public representatives — the prohibition on employers deducting recruitment expenses or retaining the personal documents, including passports, of migrant workers. There have been clear abuses. I have dealt with individuals who felt like bonded slaves since they could not leave because their documentation was withheld by an employer. We must have a clear register of abusive employers to ensure that they are never again allowed work permits.

This Bill is tailor-made for a detailed discussion on Committee Stage and I look forward to it.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I would like to share time with Deputies Connolly, Finian McGrath and Eamon Ryan.Sinn Féin welcomes the fact that this legislation puts current regulations on a statutory footing, that workers will receive copies of their work permits and the provisions that address exploitative practices on the part of employers.However, the Bill is more notable for what it fails to do than for what it does. It will bring very little improvement to the lot of migrant workers or change to the current system. It is profoundly disappointing because it is not underpinned by a desire to improve the situation of migrant workers who have contributed so much to society and the economy. I am disappointed that a Minister who, by this stage, must be fully aware of the extent to which such workers are vulnerable to exploitation resulting from the current system has chosen to do so little to resolve or address that situation.Some of the most common complaints that arise regarding the treatment of migrant workers by employers are employees not being given work contracts, statutory breaks, wage slips, days off in lieu of bank holidays worked or the correct minimum wage entitlement. Often their work permits are not renewed by employers, although they claim to employees that they are in the process of doing so. Other cases have included passports being confiscated and workers being paid less than their Irish counterparts. There have been allegations that workers have been asked to sign contracts obliging them to live exclusively in accommodation provided by their employers. Other issues encountered by the Immigrant Council of Ireland include non-payment of holiday pay, instant dismissal for being sick or having an accident in the workplace, no additional pay for weekend work and even passing on the cost of obtaining the work permit to the employee.The provisions in section 22 prohibiting deduction of remuneration and the retention of personal documents are welcome. I hope additional restrictions will be put in place in terms of some type of punitive action against wayward employers who seek to flout these regulations. They will be completely worthless unless they are enforced. It is open to question whether this can be done adequately given the low number of labour inspectors. Resources must be made available to ensure the full enforcement of these provisions.The current system makes it difficult for exploited workers to come forward with complaints against exploitative employers. It is clear the proposals related to higher skilled workers involve little change to the current system. The new system will provide no permanency and does not constitute a green card system akin to that in operation in the United States. My colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, will deal with this issue in greater detail in his contribution.The work permit system as it stands facilitates employers in exploiting migrant workers. The employer applies for and, heretofore, holds the work permit, restricting the ability of workers to leave exploitative employment. These workers are in a most vulnerable situation. Many do not speak English and most are away from their families whom they may be supporting through remittances. They may be afraid of losing their jobs and being thrown onto the street, so to speak, if they make a complaint. Moreover, they know they will not get another job because the work permit is the property of their current employer. The only legislative change in this regard is that, although it will continue to be employers who must apply for work permits, they will be issued and held by workers, with copies provided to employers.Only those workers who qualify for the two-year so-called green card will be allowed to apply for their own work permit. This restriction has been severely criticised by those groups that deal daily with the exploitation of migrant workers. For example, the Immigrant Council of Ireland has voiced its concern that this does not "provide the worker with ownership of their own labour and, as a result, concerns about workers being at risk of exploitation still remain". Under the terms of this Bill, employment permits will continue to be issued for only 12 months in cases other than those under the so-called green card system.Many cases have been reported where employers have forgotten or not even bothered to renew work permits. Such actions by employers undermine the legal status of migrant workers. In many of the cases that have come to light, employers have not told workers that their permits have not been renewed. The worker eventually discovers that the permit has expired and that he or she faces deportation. Issuing all employment permits for a period of two years would go some way to addressing these difficulties and would give both the employee and employer a sense of security that is absent when the former must renew his or her permit on an annual basis.We need migrant workers to continue to make a significant contribution to our economy and society. If it is the policy of the State to promote economic migration, we must ensure those migrants are treated equally and are given the rights and entitlements necessary to live a normal life. Most important among these is the right to have one's family nearby. This Bill will change little in regard to family reunification and nothing for those with ordinary employment permits. Migrant workers are not mere cogs in an economy but human beings who make a major contribution to the State. They should not be subjected to the hardship of being separated from their families. If we want workers to migrate to Ireland, we must show that we value their contribution by addressing the issue of family reunification as a matter of great urgency.My party is clear about the entitlements we want to see delivered for migrant workers. Work permits must be applied for, issued to and held by the employee rather than the employer, thus enabling workers to change employers and to walk away from exploitative treatment. Also required are the ratification by the State of the UN convention on the rights of migrant workers and their families and the codification of a common set of core rights and entitlements for migrant workers, including family reunification, the option of permanent residency after a fixed period, and housing, health, welfare and education rights.Migrant workers must have rights equivalent to those of the host society. Improved information on workplace related rights, available in multilingual format, must be provided. There must be effective enforcement of workplace related rights, with a particular emphasis on spot checks on those employers employing migrant workers. We must provide enhanced protection for migrant workers and other immigrants against racism, including a focus on combatting discrimination, assaults, incitement and abuse.None of these matters has been adequately dealt with in the Bill. It is most unfortunate that the opportunity has not been taken to address these important issues given the absolute dependence of our economy on migrant workers. I will address some of them on Committee Stage and I hope some of the proposed amendments will be accepted.

It is welcome notwithstanding this delay. The Bill sets out a comprehensive and clear process for the application, granting and refusal of work permits and will thus serve to streamline the recruitment procedures for migrant workers and provide enhanced safeguards for their rights and interests. It will also provide for the introduction of a green card system for highly skilled migrant workers, similar to that which pertains in other jurisdictions. It will also enable the Minister to establish the number of employment permits in total and by sector and to identify the skills and employment categories for which these permits may be granted. Its function is remarkably similar to that envisaged for the PPARS system in the health system.It is important to differentiate between a skill shortage and a labour shortage. A skill shortage signifies an insufficient number of trained, qualified individuals in the domestic market to meet the demand for an occupation. Skill shortages arise in occupations associated with particular skills that are usually acquired through education and training. In a labour shortage, on the other hand, there is an insufficient number of individuals willing to take up employment at the prevailing wages and conditions.The Bill provides for a number of new and important protections for migrant employees. However, I note the absence of any form of grievance procedure or facility for the employee to have recourse to the rights commissioner to resolve grievances. Resources must be put in place to ensure adequate enforcement of the legislation. In this regard, the number of labour inspectors must immediately be doubled. I have called in the past for the number to be increased to 75. Of the existing 31 posts, half remain vacant. If legislation is to be effective there must be the means of ensuring it is enforced.Statutory provision should also be made for a formal mechanism through which labour inspectors could liaise with the trade union movement. Many individuals arrive in Ireland with poor language skills and even less awareness of their rights and, up to now, have been ripe for exploitation. Many of these individuals possess skills which are insufficiently available among the domestic labour force. I have seen instances where mechanical engineers have had to resort to waitressing because of poor language skills. We all know of migrants working as hairdressers who have extensive qualifications in an unrelated field.This is not productive or useful for us. Such individuals should have the facility to develop their language skills in line with the technical skills for which there is a considerable need. How do the provisions of this Bill correspond to our asylum process, which must also be streamlined? We should have taken action on that some time ago.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	225	It is becoming clear that increased concerns regarding global security of energy supply puts the challenge of finding sustainable alternatives top of the energy policy agenda. With regard to promoting the production of clean energy, in April this year we launched a scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels. Under the scheme eight projects were awarded excise relief valued at €6 million over a two-year period to 2007. The number of applications in the pilot scheme clearly indicates the strong interest in a biofuels industry in Ireland. I have had contact with the Minister for Finance about the possible scope for scaling up fiscal support for biofuels.The promotion of renewable energy technologies in electricity production is a key priority of this Government and we are working to achieve our EU target of increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010. This will mean that approximately 1,400 MW of capacity from renewable sources to be connected to the electricity network by 2010. This is a challenge which will require us to more than double existing capacity within five years. This is the minimum target I am demanding and I am confident it will be achieved. In this context I recently announced a new support mechanism to be known as the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff, REFIT. This revised system will move away from competitive tendering to a fixed price proposal.In July my Northern counterpart, Angela Smith MP and I published a preliminary consultation paper on an all-island vision for renewable energy to the year 2020 and beyond. This is aimed at developing a long-term strategy for renewable energy on the island as a whole.The terms governing petroleum exploration and development are kept under constant review by my Department. These terms are attractive by international standards and are designed to encourage exploration in the Irish offshore. I have no immediate plans to reform the terms at this time.Exploration and development of minerals is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999. All extraction of minerals under the Acts is subject to payment of royalties to the State. While it is my intention to consolidate and update those Acts in a new Minerals Development Bill currently in preparation, I do not propose to change that policy.

Notwithstanding what he said in his reply on the Kyoto principles, if the Minister accelerated the programme in line with best practice as shown in other European countries, could he revise his projections with a view to achieving the objectives set in Kyoto?In regard to exploration and royalties accruing from finds either on or off shore, is it not a fact there is some public concern about the extent to which the State can benefit directly from royalties from any such finds and that now might be a good time to review this issue, while giving sufficient incentives to those involved in mineral, oil or gas exploration while at the same time giving the State a fall-back position whereby it gets the best deal possible in those circumstances?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	227	In regard to the Deputy's last question there has been no change to mineral developments and the specific regime of licences for on land and offshore. The reason the scheme is designed to be attractive is because of the particular conditions and so on for prospectivity off the Irish coast. The scheme has been revised three times since 1975, the reason on each occasion being that the numbers seeking to explore and drill wells were diminishing. Even with the attractive terms since the last revision in 1992 there has been no increase in the number of firms applying for licences. There has been no update on the drilling of wells this year. This is the first year for a considerable period when no wells will be drilled off the Irish coast. I do not consider the time is right for a change in those terms. There are some who would argue that if the terms were to be changed, they should be made even more attractive. However, that would not be feasible.With regard to achieving our targets for Kyoto, our target of 13.2% for the generation of electricity by 2010 is near enough to the limit of what we can do in that short period. I agree with the Deputy that we need to be more ambitious into the future. For that reason I have ordered a review of energy policy which I hope will be completed by mid-2006. I hope Members on all sides will contribute to that review. In the area of alternative energy we need to plan for a 20 to 25-year period rather than the short term as at present. The point the Deputy made about being more ambitious and catching up with some of our European neighbours is covered in that response also.

Electricity and gas tariff increases are the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation, the independent regulator for electricity and gas, as provided for under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and as amended by the Gas (Interim)(Regulation) Act 2002. I have given no directions to the Commission for Energy Regulation in this regard because have no power to issue any such directions.

If a senior citizen is unable to heat or light his or her house because he or she cannot afford to do so, the Minister has no function in that area. Is it not the case that we are facing fuel poverty and that under the national fuel scheme only a miserly €9 per week is available which barely covers the cost of a small bag of coal while a cylinder of gas costs approximately €21?The recent increases in gas and electricity charges will be the straw that breaks the camel's back and plunges many low-income families into a desperate position. Does the Minister agree it is a dire situation and that since the Government took office in 2002, the price of electricity has increased by 44%? Since 1 October the price of gas has increased by an astonishing 25% while there will be a huge increase of 8% in the price of electricity for business after Christmas.Is it not incredibly bad for the country on a personal and a business level that soon Ireland will be first or second on the EUROSTAT figures for energy prices? Does the Minister not have a responsibility in that area? When will he discuss with his Cabinet colleagues the dividend of €77 million being taken from the ESB this year? Is it not ridiculous given the problems with energy security and energy supply to Ireland that the Minister will get an extra stealth tax of €77 million from the ESB? Is that not his responsibility also?Is it not the case that the Minister has a responsibility to issue directives to the Commission for Energy Regulation? Under the terms of the legislation he can tell the commission the broad general development of energy pricing and energy supply. That is the Minister's responsibility and it will not do to have the kind of cop out we have heard day after day from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, saying that they have no responsibility in this regard.The Minister has responsibility for opening up these energy markets to competition. Competition in the energy market is the mantra of the Progressive Democrats but where is it? There is no competition. We have two cartels, two dominant monoliths, which dominate the gas and electricity markets. What has the Minister done to open up the electricity market in any way? As far as I can see, he has done absolutely nothing since taking over his current portfolio. Over the past year, the Minister has told us repeatedly that the gas market will be opened up. We are now well into October yet I still do not see that market opening up. I ask the Minister to reflect on those points.Does he agree that he has responsibility for that senior citizen who is in a cold house today because of Government inaction?

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I cannot tell the Commission for Energy Regulation what to do and I have no power to issue directions to it. The ESB market has been liberalised since February of this year.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	254	May I ask a brief supplementary?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Very briefly.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Over the next six weeks, will the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, be making any recommendations on fuel poverty to the Minister for Finance? Does the Minister intend to re-examine the legal position concerning the energy regulator and does he think it should be changed?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I have already indicated clearly that we are examining legislation on the CER. My colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, together with our other ministerial colleagues around the Cabinet table, will examine all aspects of social welfare matters at that time. If the Deputy has a question on fuel poverty he should direct it to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	258	Management of the wild salmon fishery is rarely a simple and straightforward matter. It is the Government's long-held view that our wild salmon stock is a national asset which must be conserved and protected, as well as being exploited as a resource by all on a shared and sustainable basis.While there remains an abundance of salmon returning to Irish rivers, the Government has accepted the scientific advice that reductions in the overall fishing effort are required to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide. For this reason, current Government policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement up to the level of the scientifically advised conservation limits as soon as possible. In keeping with this policy, when setting the commercial salmon quotas for the 2005 season, I gave a firm commitment to fully align the exploitation of salmon, both at national and district levels, on the scientific advice by 2007.I have asked the new national salmon commission to advise how best the alignment of exploitation of salmon with the scientific advice can be implemented by 2007, bearing in mind the requirement to ensure the future biological viability of the salmon resource in all catchments and also the needs of all stakeholders, including those who derive their income from the wild salmon resource.A move to single-stock management of the wild salmon fishery would take time and significant additional resources. This could not be achieved without further and considerable scientific input, infrastructural investment and planning. The impact of such a move would have to be fully examined and understood before its introduction. I expect the national salmon commission along with the relevant State agencies to examine the prospects for single-stock management within the Irish fishery and to advise me in this regard.I can assure Deputy Eamon Ryan that I will examine carefully all recommendations, including those relevant to single-stock management, made by the national salmon commission.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The national salmon commission could not agree what time of day it is, let alone this issue, and the Minister of State knows that.The Oireachtas committee has examined this complex issue in detail and drew a simple, urgent and adamant conclusion, which is the move towards single-stock management. Recognising that it will take some years to do that, the committee recommended an interim procedure for a voluntary buy-out. It would ultimately mean the complete cessation of drift netting at sea. The Minister of State needs to provide a yes or no answer on that matter. It is his responsibility to decide and he can no longer hide. If we delay making a decision for another year we will have a recurrence of this summer's events when the Minister of State ignored scientific advice and issued a quota for 150,000 fish, yet the catch was down to 100,000. That signifies what the scientists have been saying for years — that salmon stocks are at crisis levels and are close to extinction of the species in many rivers. Unless the Minister of State acts now the situation will be irreversible.This is an important political issue. If it comes to a vote, it is clear that parties in the House have committed themselves to an end to drift netting. The Minister of State must make a decision. If we are to do it for next summer, he will have to make a decision now and use the interim months to establish the system recommended by the Oireachtas committee. I want to hear if the Minister of State's answer is yes or no. If he cannot give an answer, why not? We have spent long enough talking about this matter and examining it. The ball is in the Minister of State's court and he must decide what arrangements will be put in place. He should not pass the buck to a commission that cannot possibly decide on the issue.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I would have thought that Deputy Eamon Ryan, of all Members of the House, would understand clearly that the issue is not as simple as that, although that may be the perception. More people in this House, as well as people in the media, should take the time to understand all this.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	261	We have done so and we came to that simple conclusion.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	262	There is a need to establish the level of information required to manage the fishery on a single-stock basis. It is not a question of saying yes or no. It is not as simple as that.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	263	It is.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Of course it is not.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	265	It is.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	266	This would be required on an individual river basis. Anyone who knows anything about fish stock management would realise that it is not as simple as the Deputy suggests. While many of the requirements have been or are being put in place, the level of information is not yet sufficient to permit the management of fishery on a single-stock basis. Those who served us well for a number of years on the national salmon commission, which I have re-appointed, will do so again while representing the stakeholders. They are people who are particularly interested in ensuring that we will have a sustainable fishery. We are the custodians and we want to assure these matters into the future.The Deputy tries to give the impression that nothing has been done but in 2002 we had a quota of 219,000——
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Ignoring the scientific advice.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	268	——that decreased last year to 139,000. The Deputy is not interested in those statistics but he knows this country has been built on the principle of partnership.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	269	True.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	270	There is a partnership arrangement within the national salmon commission whereby its members advise me.The Deputy forgets that it is not all about science. There are human and social factors involved also. If I went to Europe in December to fight on behalf of the Irish people on the basis of science alone, the Deputy and others would be the first to criticise me for not taking the human and social factors into consideration. The Deputy should get into his car or on his bicycle and visit the west coast and the islands to see the importance of this matter to the people there. I am being responsible in this matter despite the fact the Deputy and others are trying to portray me as otherwise and suggest that I am only interested in local politics. Of more than 800 licences, approximately 120 of them are in Donegal. The Deputy should remember the extent of the coastline from Malin Head to Bundoran. The Deputy needs to be realistic and sensible. I will work with all sides to try to ensure we have a sustainable salmon industry into the future.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Prior to my election to this House, I spent my entire working life on the Donegal coast and I know exactly what the Minister of State is talking about and I appreciate the need for social development. However, it is in the interests of those people as much as those of everybody else that we follow scientific advice and protect the species for the long-term future of those people. While the Minister of State spoke of partnership, ultimately we live in a democratic Republic and certain decisions, as with this one on whether to continue drift-netting, must be made at a political level by the Minister of State. If he fails to make that decision nobody else will make it for him. We cannot put it off for another year which would result in exactly what the Minister of State has said. Three years ago we caught 200,000 fish and this year it will be 100,000. If the Minister of State continues as he has done, next year this could reduce to 50,000 which would finish off the stock forever.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The Deputy chose to ignore the late run. He should go to Waterford and speak to its representatives where it was necessary to extend the season by one week because it had to be interrupted owing to the presence of the tall ships. The Deputy can talk to many others who are much more familiar with it.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	273	We can only catch 100,000 fish.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I recently presided over a meeting in this city at which we established the regional advisory council for the north and west coast waters. All the fishermen with an interest will have an input into the matter. While we are talking about other species, the matter must be considered from a number of perspectives.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	275	The Minister of State should make a decision one way or the other.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	276	In December 2003, my predecessor appointed expert and specialist consultants to undertake a high-level review of the inland fisheries sector in Ireland. An independent steering group was also established to oversee the work of the consultants.The aim of the review is to deliver a root and branch examination of the State's role and objectives in the inland fisheries sector. The consultants were required: to evaluate the adequacy of the current model for the governance of the inland fisheries sector; to define the current relationship between the Government, the Departments and the inland fisheries sector, and suggest new and more effective models; and to recommend a structure that will contribute to the optimum development of the inland fisheries resource in Ireland.As I previously advised the House, the report of the first stage of the high-level review of the inland fisheries sector in Ireland was received from the consultants earlier this year. While I appreciate that previous indications were that I expected to publish the report before now, I am sure the Deputy will understand that given the complexity of the issues involved, it was important that the Department had sufficient time to adequately consider the report and its findings and to develop a suitable strategy for the implementation of its recommendations, if accepted by Government.As part of its consideration, the Department has recently engaged in usual consultation with other Departments to ensure that agreed proposals can be presented to Government. It is my intention to bring this report to Government in the very near future and to have it published as soon as possible thereafter. As the Deputy will appreciate, until such time as the report is presented to Government, I am not in a position to comment on its recommendations or implementation.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	277	That was an outrageous reply given the Minister of State has had the report since May. There is huge uncertainty among the seven fisheries boards. Certain elements of the report have been leaked. Some people in jobs are uncertain as to what they can do or what will be the level of investment. The Minister of State said he is waiting for consultations. What is so extraordinary about the report that it cannot be published?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I have had the report for some months. I took the opportunity to discuss it in detail with the officials and with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey. I then circulated the report to other relevant Departments. I have arranged meetings, which have taken place, involving a number of Departments, including the Departments of Finance, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Arts, Sport and Tourism. The memorandum to Government will be finalised on the basis of these discussions and the formal responses received from them. This is a major review of our inland fisheries and we want to ensure it is absolutely right. Within a matter of weeks the report will be before Government and if accepted I will publish it immediately.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	279	How much were the consultants paid for the report? Did the consultants' brief not include the incorporation of the views of all the vested interests to which the Minister of State has now indicated the report has been circulated for opinion? I assume the consultants would have talked to the key players, North and South, with vested interests, such as those in tourism, to discuss the impact of the report and the further ongoing development needed given the huge under-funding of inland waterways.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	280	The current consultation is not with the industry but with Departments, which does not cost anything. I should have pre-empted the question about the cost and I will advise the Deputy of the cost of the review. However, we recognise the importance of conducting a wide consultation process. The consultants organised a programme of face-to-face consultation meetings and interviews with all of the stakeholders with an interest at national and local level. They also undertook a wide-sweeping range of focus groups and workshop sessions last year. In-depth research has been carried out and I hope this will culminate in changes. While leaks may have taken place and rumours exist, people should refrain from considering these and await the publication of the report at which point I will be anxious to obtain their views.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Is it not extraordinary that a report commissioned in 2003, which the Minister of State has had for almost six months, has still not been published? Who were the consultants and how much they were paid? It is an excuse for not doing anything.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The country is being run by consultants.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	283	The Minister of State has overall responsibility for marine matters. Does he not feel the report, commissioned by the Department with his imprimatur, should be available for discussion in the industry? It is extraordinary that we have been waiting two years for the report.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The consultants are Farrell Grant Sparks, as I am sure the Deputy is aware. The brief they were given was to carry out a root and branch examination of the central and regional boards, and the Government's involvement in the governance of the sector as well as the involvement of other State bodies, including the Marine Institute, BIM, ESB, Dúchas, as it then was, the EPA and Fáilte Ireland. It is a very detailed report.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	285	How much did it cost?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I do not have the cost. However, I will make the information available to the Deputy as soon as possible.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	287	Are these the same consultants that carried out due diligence on behalf of the Government in respect of Irish Ferries?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	288	It was not done on behalf of the Government. As I recall they were asked to carry it out on behalf of the company. My Department had no involvement.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I may have been guilty of unparliamentary language towards Deputy Broughan earlier when I suggested he might shut up and let me answer the question. If so, I apologise to the Deputy.I presume the review to which the Deputy refers is the health and safety review of the Corrib onshore upstream gas pipeline. On 25 August I appointed Advantica consultants to conduct that review, which will critically examine all relevant documentation relating to the design, construction and operation of the onshore upstream section of the Corrib gas pipeline and associated facilities. It will also identify any deficiencies of whatever kind relating to these matters and make recommendations regarding them. This review is currently under way. It includes a public consultation process and a two-day public hearing in the locality, which commenced this morning. It is my intention to continue the current practice of making all appropriate material relating to the Corrib project available on my Department's website.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I thank the Minister for his reply. Does the Minister agree it is vital that the entire project be placed under review and that all relevant minutes of meetings which took place between the Department officials and Shell should be released into the public domain? This should include details of a meeting which took place between the Taoiseach and Tom Botts of Shell on 19 September 2003.Will there be full disclosure of the procedures under which Bellanaboy Wood was transferred to Shell for use for the proposed refinery? Is the Minister aware of a reply to a question asked by Bairbre de Brúin at the European Commission? The European Commission has stated:Projects which are likely to have significant effects on the environment and that would require an environment impact assessment under EU directives should not be split into sub-projects so that each of them taken individually is determined not to have significant environmental effects and thus escape the obligation set out in the directive.Does the Minister agree that the Corrib project is an amalgamation of sub-projects, thus avoiding an environmental impact assessment? Would the Minister agree to a full and transparent inquiry being held on all aspects, including health and safety matters as well as the licensing terms, so that they too should be subject to the review?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	291	No, I would not. This project went through a series of consents, licences and so on — planning foreshore Acts, continental shelf Acts and a variety of others. It was judged under all those headings and got the necessary consents and licences in accordance with law. Accordingly I do not agree that the entire project should be reviewed and revised and that we should go back to square one.I have strong views reflected in the Planning and Development Act 2000 that there should be maximum participation and consultation in matters such as these as they go through the planning process. I do not agree with the view which some people appear to hold, that having held such consultations one should then try to put the matter through other types of inquires, then bring it to court, then to the European Commission, and in general try to stop development. What we need, and have in place, are strong, robust mechanisms for judging projects like this by independent bodies. Once such procedures are concluded, projects should be allowed to move ahead. Otherwise we will get nothing done.Regarding environmental impact statements and assessments, Deputy Ferris may be under a misapprehension. I do not disagree with what the European Commission has said, but the project through its various stages of development underwent EISs or EIAs as appropriate. In terms of delivery the project is broken into seven phases but the EISs and EIAs were in place before the phased development began. That development was undertaken to manage the project and it gives the Department some control over it in that each phase must have separate consent in order to move forward.Any minutes of meetings relevant to this matter are, to my knowledge, on the Department website. If there are relevant minutes kept in another Department, I suggest the Deputy direct his question to that Department. The instruction in my Department is that everything over which we have control is made available on the website.Regarding the terminal site, I understand from the time I was involved in the relevant committee — though I am not sure I am fully correct — that parliamentary questions were tabled a week or two weeks ago for the Minister for Agriculture and Food with regard to the responsibility held by Coillte in terms of land sales. That is my information but I am not entirely sure this is the case.I responded earlier to a question regarding the terms and conditions of the leases. There is currently no proposal to change them. If we discover four or five energy fields similar to Corrib off the west coast of Ireland, and people begin to get interested in exploration and in drilling wells there, that would be the time to review the conditions.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The changes in the energy landscape in terms of our increasing dependence on imported fossil fuels, world movements in fuel prices, the move to liberalised markets and carbon constraints from our Kyoto obligations make it necessary to consider carefully how we will meet the energy needs of the economy and wider society in a sustainable and affordable way for the future. I have therefore instructed my officials to draft a comprehensive policy statement which fully addresses the issues and challenges that lie ahead in the energy area. I aim to have a completed paper ready for publication in early 2006.It is my intention that the policy paper will have both a medium and a long term perspective, explaining the policies that are in place now and which will have a direct effect over the next five years or so. I am also looking forward to 2020 and beyond to assess what our energy needs might be and what policies we might adopt to ensure that those needs can be met in a sustainable way and at an affordable cost.Deputies will be aware that a comprehensive review of the electricity sector is currently under way to examine the institutional arrangements and market structures for the sector here. That study is well progressed and the consultants involved have engaged in extensive consultations with stakeholders in the sector. I expect to receive the final report before the end of the year. The outcome of this review will form an essential part of the policy paper.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	293	It is disappointing that the publication of the White Paper on energy seems to have been postponed yet again and that it has taken the skyrocketing price of oil, at $70 and more per barrel to focus our minds on the matter. Would the Minister welcome submissions from all the stakeholders in the energy industry and from the other political parties in this House in order to shape the medium and long term strategy?Does the Minister share the concerns recently expressed by the British Minister of State for Energy, Mr. Malcolm Wicks MP, about power cuts this winter in the UK due to gas shortages and, in particular, wider problems in the British wholesale gas market? Is it possible that security of supply of Irish gas could be affected? Will security of supply be a key component of the White Paper on energy?I welcome the pricing initiative announced by the Minister and the replacing of the AER programme. That is something we could perhaps discuss in this House. Does the Minister intend to take any initiative in the coming months with regard to fiscal incentives?There has been a great deal of guff in the media since the Minister and I last met. I recall Professor Moore McDowell, David McWilliams and other proponents of the dismal profession of economics urging us all to go nuclear. This campaign appears to have been started by the British nuclear industry. Will the Minister ensure that the economics and the dangers of nuclear power are adequately referred to in the energy policy document?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	294	It is my intention that nuclear power will be mentioned in the energy policy document but only to reiterate the consistent position of the Government and of the Irish people. We made the decision a long time ago. That is not to say that we should not review decisions but I strongly believe that the potential environmental consequences of moving to nuclear energy far outweigh the environmental and, probably, economic advantages. There will not be a long chapter on nuclear power. What I have said is probably a summary of it. There are those who disagree with that position and there are environmental and economic cost reasons for using nuclear power, but we have made our decision on the matter.I am not sure what the Deputy means by saying that the policy document has been postponed yet again. I only announced it in July and said it would be ready in 2006.

The energy policy review was put in place when oil was approximately $35 per barrel. With regard to the security of gas supply, there is a tightness of supply which will probably get worse from 2006 to 2008. There are capacity constraints in the UK. The CER has warned about this. I have not yet received advice from the CER that it believes we will be without gas at any stage but that is a possibility. It has warned about scarcity of supply issues.With regard to fiscal incentives in the budget, there is a tradition that no budgetary matters are discussed in the House prior to the Budget Statement. However, it is no secret that we are extremely pleased with the response on biofuels. We hope to encourage, through incentives, the use of renewables and energy efficiency. I made that clear previously and I will continue to push for it.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Will the Minister comment on the decision by the regulator some months ago to the effect that it was intended not to support wind generated electricity to any great extent in the future? To what extent will that impact on his alternative energy policy?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I warmly welcome the Minister's comments ruling out nuclear power as a future option in this country. I endorse those comments but I differ with him on one point. One of the main arguments against it, as well as the environmental one, is that economically it makes no sense. It is probably the most expensive form of power. Given that our renewable energy supplies are significantly cheaper at present than what the CER recognises as the price of a best new entrant gas supplier, the cheapest of the fossil fuels, what would limit the amount of renewables we should develop? This country has a remarkable abundance of wave, wind, biomass and tidal power. There are 21 different supplies of renewables. Why would we think of limiting it? Why not go for 100% energy from renewables within our lifetime?

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I did not hear the Minister's statement, just the regulator's.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	306	That might be called selective hearing. I made a strong statement afterwards. I also made an active statement on the issue when introducing the latest feed-in tariffs, which are a help mainly to wind energy although not only to wind energy.With regard to Deputy Ryan's question about what would limit this, currently there are physical limitations on the grid. ESB Networks is working on this. It has a huge investment programme. The physical constraints of the system is one of the limitations. In addition, wind energy is not the solution to everything. There must be a back-up for every megawatt of wind energy that is produced to cater for the days when wind is not available. That is the reason we need to move into other areas, which the Deputy supports, whether that is biomass, tidal or current energy.I welcome what Deputy Broughan has said publicly and what Deputy Eamon Ryan has said to me privately on this area. We should, if possible, work together to arrive at an agreed policy on renewables. It would be useful because the one thing this sector requires is stability and the ability to know what will happen over a 20 to 25-year period. That is required for the type of decision that must be made about investment in this area.

Why are we spending so many billions designing it in a way that does not suit renewables? Will the Minister give a direction to the ESB or the CER to change the investment so that spending on the grid supports renewables rather than, as is the case at present, spending money which blocks renewables?

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	314	While I am aware that the Joint Committee for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources submitted recommendations yesterday, 11 October 2005, regarding the future management of the wild salmon resource in Ireland, I have not had the opportunity to consider those fully in the intervening 24 hours nor have I had the opportunity to undertake any consultations on the committee's report since its publication. However, I welcome the publication of this report and take this opportunity to thank the joint committee for its decision to conduct a review and give all stakeholders an opportunity to be heard by the committee. This has illuminated the various and wide-ranging issues surrounding the management of this important natural resource.The Deputy will be aware that as part of this review, the joint committee held public hearings in April of this year. When addressing those hearings, I made the point that the management of this natural resource is rarely a simple and straightforward matter. I also reiterated the Government's long held view that our wild salmon stock is a national asset which must be conserved and protected as well as being exploited as a resource by all on a shared and sustainable basis. I am pleased, therefore, to note from the report that the joint committee acknowledges the complexity of this issue and makes "the unequivocal observation that its report must not be seen in terms of winners or losers and that the debate and focus of effort must be on the survival of the salmon species".I will examine carefully the recommendations made by the joint committee in this regard. As an immediate first step, I have already asked the new national salmon commission, which held its first meeting yesterday, to ensure that the joint committee's report receives priority in its consideration of how best the wild salmon resource may be managed, conserved and exploited on a shared and sustainable basis into the future, having regard to Government policy.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Does the Minister of State intend that the Department's officials, in addition to the salmon commission, will study the report and offer their recommendations? In light of the EU's unhappiness with the way Ireland is dealing with this, has the Minister of State reacted to the correspondence from the Commissioner for Fisheries? Ireland is the only country in the north-west fishing region that permits drift and draft netting. The British Government is also unhappy with this situation and has published an angling charter. It was dismayed that Ireland is the only country where drift net fishing is allowed. Does the Minister of State agree with the point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan that recommendations as to the number of licences to be issued were ignored by the Department? Does he intend in the coming year to abide by the scientific recommendations?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	316	Both my departmental officials and I will study this report. We will also be in correspondence with the EU on the subject of fisheries and the general environment. It is very difficult to explain this situation. Even Deputy Perry accepts there is no other commercial fishing of salmon in the north west. I am confident Deputy Perry is not trying to deceive the House but he knows well and I will remind him that following a voluntary buy-out in the north east of England costing £3.25 million there are still 25,000 salmon being commercially landed in the north east of England. A similar buy-out in Ireland would be very substantial. If authorities in some other countries are telling us it is not happening anywhere else then they are mistaken. I ask the Deputy not to take my word for it but to ask the UK authorities which will provide the same information. We need to start from the same base if we wish to arrive at a conclusion.On the question of the scientific advice, I did not hear Deputy Perry or many of his colleagues shouting last June when we established a quota of 139,900. I repeat this was the advice from the salmon commission and it was accepted by me and by all my predecessors in office. The scientific advice changed at the last minute. This was a partnership arrangement. The members of the salmon commission come from varying backgrounds. They presented me with this advice and I accepted it. It was not a case of me being advised by them to accept a quota which I then increased. The only sin I have committed is that I have taken the advice I received from the salmon commission, as did my predecessors. We arestriving to achieve what was advised by the year 2007.

Is he in favour of buying out the drift net salmon fishermen? Will he do so or will he stand behind the report? The Minister of State and the Government are responsible for the decision. Will he offer a buy-out scheme to the drift net fishermen in order to preserve the salmon stocks for angling and other tourism purposes?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I am not averse to doing so. I want to do what is right for the country, for angling, for tourism and for the commercial sector. It is possible to have a balance between commercial fishing and angling and tourist fishing. However I am opposed to the transfer of a resource from one sector to another at the expense of the Irish taxpayer. I am still awaiting offers from those who have both informed me and stated publically on numerous occasions they were prepared to make a contribution. I ask the Deputy to consider that if it were to be banned or if there were to be a complete buy-out, other important factors cannot be ignored. I refer to the issues of pollution, poaching and global warming. I have also asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to examine the issue of seals.

What is the Minister of State's attitude to the report? Colleagues on this side of the House worked on the sub-committee. Given that all sectors must work together to arrive at a reasonable solution, does he not agree the report issued yesterday suggested a reasonable solution?My great predecessor as Labour Party spokesperson, Michael Bell, four years ago proposed a buy-out under certain conditions. The report suggested a reasonable solution moving towards single stock management. Will the Minister of State endorse this finding and move forward on that basis in 2006?I have a question to ask of both Ministers. Were they disappointed at the stance taken by the Progressive Democrats in this regard? I described that party as possibly an equally endangered but less useful species than our beautiful salmon. Will this issue bring down the Government? Will the eight Progressive Democrats, that small species of right-wing economists and business people, pull the Government down over this matter because of its lack of action?

I can speak for my party — I do not know what the Fianna Fáil members can say. The Green Party requests that the Minister of State act on the report's recommendations.The Minister of State is willing to talk about buy-out arrangements and he has referred to the cases in England. Is he willing to arrange a meeting, as a matter of urgency, with Mr. Vickerson, who was involved in the negotiations in that case and in four other similar agreements? He is a member of a conservation organisation that might help fund such a buy-out. If this issue is to be resolved before the next season will the Minister of State agree to meet Mr. Vickerson?

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	343	At a meeting in November 2004, Mr. Barry Gardiner MP, the then Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and I endorsed plans put forward by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation for the construction of a second north-south electricity interconnector.Planning for the construction of the interconnector is continuing. The transmission system operators are currently working on phase one of the project, including technical issues and route selection. This phase is likely to be completed by early 2007. Phase two, the construction phase, will then commence and it is estimated that the interconnector will be operational by 2012.The proposed interconnector will provide increased system security and reliability. It will be a positive step toward further developing competition and will facilitate the development of a fully functioning single electricity market.The CER has appointed consultants to advise on the financial, technical, commercial and procurement aspects of the development of the east-west electricity interconnector. Phase one of the project, which is nearing completion, is examining procurement options, routing, capacity, ownership and operational parameters.A consultation process involving all parties that have expressed an interest was undertaken. A decision on how best to take the project forward, whether on a regulated or a hybrid regulated, merchant basis, is the next step and determination will be informed by the advice of the CER.The two natural gas interconnectors with the UK, IC1 and IC2, have been operational since 1995 and 2003 respectively. As part of the development of the gas network on an all-island basis, the South-North pipeline, due for completion in 2006, will carry gas to Belfast from the IC2 landfall at Gormanstown.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	344	Will the Minister indicate the extent to which he can speed up the development of the proposed east-west interconnector? Such an interconnector will enable us to sell surplus electricity generated here on the European market as well as to obtain surplus electricity that may be generated in Britain. This is important with reference to the continuity of energy supply and the balance within the grid between electricity generated by air and by other means. The east-west interconnector will ensure that we maintain supply and can avail of best practice in both directions to support our economy.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I will do everything I possibly can to speed up the process but it is not entirely within our control. I am awaiting the report from CER which is investigating the matters I outlined earlier. Once that report is published, a decision has to be made on the ownership of the interconnector. More importantly, however, we must get agreement on both sides of the Irish Sea on the putting in place of the necessary infrastructure to enable the electricity to be transmitted. It would be desirable, as Deputy Durkan has argued, to have this project completed sooner rather than later and certainly I will do anything I can to speed up the process.The planning process comes into play on this project, on both sides of the Irish Sea and there is a uncertainty regarding the length of time the planning aspects will take. As soon as I have the report and have made a decision on it, I will make it public and we will try to expedite the interconnector as quickly as possible after that.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Does the Department have a plan B if, in the event of an emergency, supplies from Scotland were unavailable? Is there a plan to keep the radiators heated and the lights on?What is the long-term plan for the interconnectors? Does the Minister foresee the development of the market between these islands as a fundamental step forward with regard to energy supply and pricing on the island of Ireland?For those who have been deeply involved with the Corrib gas field issue for the last three or four months, the critical necessity, in terms of security of supply, is to bring forward that gas in an agreed and consultative way. It should be done in a manner on which the local community in north Mayo, the companies and the Government are agreed. The issue was discussed in terms of what could go wrong but there is an onus on us to ensure security of supply through Connacht and into Ireland as soon as possible.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	347	CER is the body with responsibility for security of supply and capacity issues. It works very closely with the transmission operators and the generators of electricity. There are back-up plans in place. There are extra generators available that are not currently in use and a system is in place that allows for a shut-down in particular areas. There is a contingency plan in the event of some systems failure.There was a problem with the system at the end of August, which was sorted out relatively quickly. It caused some difficulty and the problem was with the interconnector and of a technical nature. The problem was overcome without major loss of supply for any length of time. That problem was technical but in general terms, there is a plan for back-up in the event of short-term breakdowns.With regard to the Deputy's question about future markets and interconnectors, we hope to have a single electricity market in place on this island by mid-2007. This will be a stepping stone to a larger market on the islands of Britain and Ireland. The EU is very supportive of the development of electricity regions and we form one particular region. The more interconnections we have, the better, particularly in terms of security of supply and extra competition.Despite what some people have argued, the Corrib gas field is extremely important to this country from a security of supply point of view. Deputy Broughan referred earlier to the UK market, the gas constraints there and statements that have been made in that regard. The problem of future constraints is simply a fact. I do not know if the gas from Corrib will be flowing ashore in time to meet some of the capacity constraints that the UK market will experience but the Corrib field is absolutely essential to this country.It is not the case, as some people assert, that the Corrib gas will be of no benefit to this country at all. The gas is extremely important. It is an indigenous source of gas for ourselves and will ensure security of supply. It has been estimated that Corrib will reduce our gas imports by 50% or 60% in the first four or five years of transmission. Corrib is extremely important and I share Deputy Broughan's desire that the project goes ahead. I acknowledge the role he and other Members of the House have played in trying to advance it and hopefully the progress made in the last number of weeks will continue.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	348	Given that in the future we will be dependent on gas for electricity generation and that gas will shortly come from Siberia which is at risk of interruption for a number of reasons, is the Minister considering long-term storage systems such as the pumping back of gas into the Seven Heads of Kinsale field as a storage location or the installation or development of an LNG facility to provide some sort of long distance security in view of the eventuality to which Deputy Broughan referred?In regard to long-term grid structures in which we might invest, rather than the nuclear option, which is ruled out, should we consider a European grid of off-shore wind farms, connected up together, so that we would get over the variability factor in terms of the extent of such a grid from the North Sea to the Portuguese coast which would mean wind would always be blowing at a certain time? This project would be of great significance to Ireland given that we have a huge amount of wind resources which could tap in to such a futuristic grid.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I would be very supportive of the concept put forward by the Deputy for an alternative European energy grid. Very often when we have discussions in this country about energy and make comparisons with countries in Europe, we forget that most of the grid system in Europe is connected. Denmark has a fantastic record in regard to wind energy. It is connected into a European grid system whereby it can buy and sell. It probably imports as much electricity as it exports at various times. I would support such a connection. Any kind of connection from here into the European grid system should and would be of enormous benefit to the country. Anything that lessens our dependence on our own suppliers at present would be of huge benefit to us.On the first part of the question, we are examining and trying to encourage alternatives so that we will not be dependent on gas from Siberia and other very unstable parts of the world. The indications are that a number of private sector companies may be interested in providing an LNG terminal in Ireland. It would cost approximately €500 million to put in place. Whether the State should go down that route or encourage the private sector to do so is something we could debate, but it is being considered. The other suggestion the Deputy made in regard to pumping back the gas into Kinsale or other areas around the coast is also being considered. Research in this regard is being carried out by the GSI and some private companies.

The legislation will lead to a great improvement in working conditions for a number of people.However, the sad fact is that we are now doing what happened to Irish people for a number of years. There are a small number of unscrupulous employers who should be exposed for what they are doing. Many migrants seeking a new life for themselves have been subjected to the most shameful exploitation by a minority of unscrupulous employers. We have seen television documentaries about employers who retain passports and treat migrants as little more than bonded labour. I have seen this happen in my locality in Monaghan. We have seen television programmes about people being used as sex slaves in Liverpool. If that is happening in Liverpool, there is a possibility it is also happening here. This type of activity must be rooted out of society.Under the legislation, overseas recruitment agencies who charge employees exorbitant fees will have those fees reduced substantially. Many migrant workers are in fear and dread of such agencies because they feel they are still tied or bonded to them. The new legislation will mean that employees will no longer be tied to employers through a permits system. The decision to grant future work permits to employees rather than to employers is significant. In future, under the Bill, employers will still apply for the work permit on behalf of employees but, when issued, the permit will become the property of employees.It will also set out basic rights and entitlements, of which employers will receive a copy. This is significant, because employers held work permits as a means of holding workers as slaves. Employers will be prevented from deducting recruitment expenses from the wages of workers or from retaining their personal documents. There have been examples of such exploitation whereby employers retain documents, provide workers with wages and housing and charge whatever rent they like, leaving workers with little or nothing.Breaches of the new regulations will result in significant fines for employers. However, a fine of €1,000 in one case might be meaningless in another case. I trust that such penalties will be sufficiently severe to provide an adequate deterrent to the minority of ruthless employers.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I welcome the debate but I have major concerns about the legislation. It is important to have an informed debate and to examine the details and technicalities of the Bill. I hope it is not a charter for exclusion and low pay, which only applies to people from disadvantaged and poor countries. The legislation presents an opportunity to protect workers who travel to Ireland. It is important that we as a society should ensure these workers are not exploited. I am concerned that sections of the legislation might lead to it being called the snobbery Bill because permits will only be issued to people who are highly skilled and well paid while people at the bottom of the employment heap will be ignored. These issues must be discussed given the concerns that have been expressed. When the Minister replies, I would like to him to clarify these issues.The legislation codifies the current employment permits administrative procedures, including the work permits and working visa-work authorisation schemes. The Bill provides for the application, grant, renewal, and refusal of employment permits. It also provides that employment permits are granted to the employee and that the permit will state certain rights and entitlements of the worker concerned. The sections dealing with this must be clarified and strengthened. The Bill prohibits recruitment related deductions from remuneration and the retention by the employer of the employee's personal documents. The legislation will also empower the Minister to formulate parameters within which an active economic migration policy may be pursued. I have concerns about this because the Minister of the day will decide the parameters and they depend on the mood and whim of the Minister. What will happen if an anti-immigrant Minister or Government is in power, which we experienced previously?During this debate on migrant workers, we should also address the issue of respect for these workers and our recent history on asylum seekers. According to the myth, Ireland has been flooded with asylum seekers. However, this group represents a relatively small portion of total inward migration. Half the new arrivals over the past ten years were returning emigrants. Approximately, 60,000 work permits issued last year compared with 8,000 asylum applications. We should bury the myth that asylum seekers are in receipt of social welfare payments to buy cars, mobile telephones and alcohol. They receive full bed and board while their applications are processed but other than that, they receive the same welfare payments as Irish citizens. This has been misrepresented in the broader debate.I also refer to the "stealing our jobs" syndrome. Asylum seekers are barred from working while their cases are examined but many work on a voluntary basis on refugee projects in their own communities during that time. I have met many of them who were members of delegations to the Oireachtas representing voluntary and community groups. It is often claimed that asylum applications are bogus and applicants do not have a right to be in Ireland. I accept a number have been deemed ineligible under the Geneva Convention but most are forced to leave their homelands because of dire economic, political or social circumstances and this should be taken on board. Sections 3 to 6, inclusive, specify the conditions under which an application for employment permit may be made. Section 3 provides for the making of an application for an employment permit and outlines the categories of persons who may apply for an employment permit. Section 4 provides that employment permits are granted to the employee and requires applications to be accompanied by a fee prescribed by the Minister while section 5 specifies the information to be provided in an application by an employer.I welcome the debate. People have an opportunity to be more welcoming towards immigrant workers. It must be ensured their rights are protected and we must remember our own history.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on behalf of my party. I concur with Deputy Finian McGrath's comments about asylum seekers. While this issue is not central to the legislation, I regret there was not greater co-operation between the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to use the Bill to set conditions that would enable asylum seekers to work. One of the great wrongs in our society is the manner in which asylum seekers are treated. If one wished, one could not design a system more likely to depress and to oppress people than to accept them into the State as asylum seekers than this system that refuses them the ability to work while their applications are being decided. To be forced into a long-term period of unemployment is a deeply depressing experience and it is shameful for us, as a State, to operate that system. I regret that the legislation is not viewed in a wider context around the whole issue of immigration.Similar to Deputy Howlin, and contrary to what people might expect, I would turn to America to examine how migratory work patterns can be addressed. During the last referendum on the issue of nationality and citizenship, particularly as it related to non-nationals whose children were born in the State, I was struck by the number of American Congressmen and Senators who visited Ireland to argue the case for following a proper republican line and vindicating the rights of immigrants. That sense of a republic has a strong effect. We should follow America's example because it, more than other country, has been successful in bringing migratory peoples together, including our ancestors. Perhaps, we could follow that model to address the issue, given the difficulties experienced in other countries. Generations can be passed over and it is possible to meet the grandchild of an immigrant who still has not assimilated and who does not feel part of the country. Our economy is probably the most open in the western world and it is undergoing rapid and radical change. It behoves this economy more than any other to get the issue of migrant work right.However, under the American model capitalism untrained is rampant but I fear the Government's policies are still based on the simple basic analysis that as much economic growth as possible is good and that is our only measure of success as a country. That is a dangerous policy. While, gladly, foreign workers can be recruited to make up the shortfall in labour supply, proceeding full steam ahead on that basis is risky and it is not necessarily the best policy. Should we trip up due to an economic downturn, we would face a mighty fall. I would prefer if the State adopted a gradual, consistent and steady approach rather than implementing migration, employment and economic policies on the basis of always trying to achieve maximum economic growth. I am not sure that is a sensible economic policy in the long run. No one wants to return to what we had and while we should welcome and celebrate our recent success, we should be wary of setting policy goals on the basis of maximising GNP because that focus is too narrow.The legislation proposes a two-tiered system through the provision of green cards and separate legislative protections for unskilled workers. I share Deputy Howlin's concerns but if we must be careful and restrict the numbers, different conditions apply. The green card system does not provide an attractive option. If the Minister is serious about attracting high skilled people we will go further and examine issues such as permanent residency and the treatment of the partners and families of the migrant workers. We need to make sure Ireland leads the way in this regard and provides proper checks and balances.Does the Minister wish to make a point?

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I hope so and I will be following this on Committee Stage to ensure that this is not a measure merely to suit our needs, particularly in respect of people on short-term stays. We must promote Ireland as an attractive location for people to come to.I have serious concerns about the protection of migrant workers. The main concern is that we have not changed the fact that the employee is in a state of servitude, regardless of the checks implemented after that. If the employer holds the permit, he or she is in a position of remarkable power compared with someone who may not speak English as a first language, may not be well educated and may not have the confidence to deal with the legal or State support systems. This plays into the hand of the employer.How will we deal with transitional issues where someone wishes to leave one employer for another? How long will this take and what are the rights of the worker in this situation? This must be teased out and improved on Committee Stage.On Private Members' business last night we debated the matter of Irish Ferries. New workers from outside the EU must not be seen as a cheap option to undercut the Irish workforce. It is vital we provide access to the Human Rights Commission, the Labour Court and the full array of State facilities that provide support to migrant workers. If we do not do so, we will create a frightening culture, as suggested by Deputy Howlin, if there is an economic downturn and unemployment rises. Those without jobs will immediately blame Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats but the second instinct will be to blame migrant workers.To date we have handled this matter reasonably well although canvassing door to door exposes the shocking extent of racism.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	366	We are managing the huge influx. If we have a downturn and there is a sense that those workers are undercutting Irish workers, there will be a major problem. As well as basic justice motivating us, this potential problem behoves us to get this legislation right to ensure it is not cheap labour we create but prosperity for all, including those visiting and working in our country for whatever period.A key section of the Bill we support ensures employers do not abuse employees in respect of restrictions on pay or accommodation. The real issue is how we enforce and police the employment rights we are setting out. Despite the provisions in this Bill there are serious concerns that we are not getting it right. That we have eight different bodies dealing with employment rights while workers operate in a transitory system and may not have good knowledge of the country is a remarkable deficiency. While there is a commitment to 31 additional inspectors, we still only have 16. This is a remarkable indictment of the seriousness of intent on this issue. That the number of inspections in 2004 was 33% less than the figure for 2003 runs contrary to the direction in which I wish to see us go.There are other steps we could take. We could ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. This was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1990. Ratifying this would demonstrate that as a small open economy that has benefitted greatly from the open world economy we are setting the highest standards and setting an example of the way to go.My last point is that the Bill gives extensive powers to an incumbent Minister in respect of regulating migration policy. This depends on who is the Minister but I am not sure it is appropriate for one Minister to have such power in his or her hands.

These Bills closely reflect our changing society, specifically in respect of our working lives. The Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill responds to the pressure of today's working family and the ways in which we are trying to achieve a balance between work and life. This Employment Permits Bill is a direct response to our dynamic society, population and workforce.This Government does not take current economic success for granted. Employment is central to our growth and sustaining employment is a central plank of this Government's policy. It follows that employment rights and work permits must be tailor-made to suit that policy. At times we must calibrate policy to fit in to our overall objective of sustaining our economy and prosperity.People were appalled at claims that a Filipino was hired to work on a ship for just over €1 per hour and that money due to Turkish workers was paid into Dutch bank accounts without their knowledge. This Bill aims to protect all workers, particularly vulnerable migrant workers, many of whom live under the media radar in this country but who are essential for our sustained economic growth.The most significant social change that has happened in the last eight to ten years is the virtual eradication of unemployment and its companion, mass emigration. Since 1997 the numbers working in Ireland has increased by more than 450,000 people to a total of almost 2 million. Unemployment has been reduced from 11% to 4.2%, which is a state of virtually full employment. Long-term unemployment has been reduced from 6% to 1.4%. The reality behind this is an enormous reduction in poverty. A recent ESRI report shows that the poverty rate in Ireland dropped from 17.45% in 1994 to 4.7% in 2001. A major factor driving this reduction was the growth in employment. We have turned from mass emigration in this country to net inward migration.For centuries Ireland provided cheap labour and goods to Britain and even after independence was achieved, significant levels of emigration continued over decades. Irish people made their homes in the world's strongest economies, namely, Britain, the United States and other English speaking countries. Today we are one of the strongest economies in the world and, understandably, we have become a destination for immigrants to make homes and new lives among us. Moving from monocultural homogeneity to a multicultural context has been a challenge for Ireland. Our society is still adjusting and has moved from a fearful hesitancy towards newcomers to a welcome recognition of the benefits that accrue from these newcomers in terms of labour and cultural diversity.There are many people in Ireland who fear the change but they fail to recognise the value and positive influence of cultural and racial change in Ireland. They are blind to the fact that we need migrant workers to sustain prosperity that is fuelling everything else in modern Ireland, including services, infrastructure and individual prosperity for our citizens.The ESRI and others have pointed out the need for migrant labour to meet the workforce demand in our buoyant economy. The percentage of firms reporting vacancies increased during the first three months of 2005, reaching 10% in March. If we continue our pro-enterprise policies, strong economic growth will continue into the foreseeable future. Economic growth, as measured by real GDP, is forecast to grow by 5.7% in 2005 and by 5% in 2006. Much of that growth depends on the contribution of migrant workers. While EU nationals, nationals of the European economic area and Swiss nationals require no visa or permit to live and work in Ireland, others must seek such permission.The Employment Permits Act 2003 provided for those procedures and the vast majority of non-EU and EEA migrant workers enter Ireland on those employment permits. Under that system it is the employer, not the would-be employee, who applies for the permit. As I recall, that was motivated by a desire to control the labour market and linked economic migration to labour force needs. That was an appropriate policy objective at the time. Sadly, widespread abuse of that system has been reported, including agencies providing workers with fake permits for non-existent jobs, workers forced into indentured labour and signing away future earnings. This may even happen before they have left their own country. Workers may receive less than the promised wage, less than the minimum wage, and have illegal deductions from salaries and so on. A large part of the problem, according to the Immigrant Council of Ireland, is that the employer effectively controls the employment permit. The worker is not free to sell his or her labour in the marketplace and may feel intimidated from making any complaints about such grievances and-or exploitation.Apart from these reported abuses, the current restrictive and cautious immigration system reflects an earlier period when the country attracted very few migrants. We know the situation has changed utterly in recent years. While the system has been commended for being flexible, it does not do enough to protect workers and their families and has become extremely burdensome and overly bureaucratic for employers. Everything we do should be tested for its impact on enterprise and keeping jobs growing in the country. It is important that we are able to calibrate this work permit legislation and other related legislation to meet the needs of the day. The difficulty appears to be about who controls the permit and how best to protect the rights and entitlements of these migrant workers. Under this Bill, the employment permits will in future issue to the employee and the permit will state certain rights and entitlements of the worker concerned. The Bill bans the practice of deducting money related to recruitment from earnings and it will also prohibit employers retaining a worker's personal documents.This Government wants to ensure effective monitoring of the working conditions of all persons with work visas. Enforcement will be a key aspect. The labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for monitoring employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland. We need more inspectors well resourced to pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and, when evidence of non-compliance is found action must be taken. In this regard I welcome the agreement to recruit an additional ten labour inspectors to the labour inspectorate, as well as a manger. Enforcement will be key. It will be the proof of this legislation if migrant workers feel protected by our domestic legislation. These measures should strengthen the capacity to ensure that workers are protected and will act as a preventative measure to prevent abuse as has happened in the past.I note the Department has produced a series of information leaflets in nine languages about employment rights legislation in Ireland. That is to be welcomed. The languages covered are Chinese, Czech, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Brazilian, Portuguese, Romanian and Russian reflecting, interestingly, the real diversity of the modern workforce in Ireland. I assume those leaflets will be updated to take account of the new workers' protection provisions.Debate on a Bill like this inevitably raises issues of global migration and the challenges posed to the rich countries of the north, like Ireland. With the enlargement of the European Union to the east, it was presumed at the time that most of our non-national labour force needs would be met from that source. That is not so. We still need non-EU migrants. Labour constraints persist in certain services sectors, for example, the catering and hospitality industries. In the wider sense the levels of poverty and lack of opportunity in Africa and other regions of the developing world make mass economic migration from these areas predictable, foreseeable and, in the light of our own experience, understandable.Many people in developed countries, including Ireland, bemoan and at times even resent inward migration but I believe it is very much a part of the human condition. Perhaps the most compelling human instinct, apart from procreation, is the desire to make a better life for one's family when there is no opportunity at home. We know that from our own memory of mass migration over the generations.When we discuss the welfare and rights of migrant workers in Ireland, it is easy to forget the families and communities those people have left behind, as so many of our own people have done over the years. As we put in place these protections for our migrant workers, we must also aim our foreign policy, in terms of joined up Government, towards working for a fairer world order, including the minimisation of population displacement and refugee flows from the developing world. That will be done by an enlightened foreign policy and development co-operation. Our current model of development co-operation is widely acclaimed in that it helps to build sustainable economic and human development in poor countries. We focus our programme on the poorest of the poor in the world. As we are aware, wars, chronic poverty, natural disasters, as we have seen recently, and lack of opportunity produce mass movements of people seeking refuge and economic opportunity in developed countries.Political refugees have separate protection under our domestic legislation and internationally under the Geneva Convention. Sadly, in Ireland migrants and refugees have become interchangeable and blurred terms. Many refugees are economic migrants and because our asylum and economic migration systems were unresolved, the asylum system had become swamped and abused by those seeking a better life. Many people claiming asylum were economic migrants but had no way of coming here legally and sought the only access point, that is, through the refugee asylum system. That is not good for the asylum system because it clogs it up and makes it more difficult for genuine asylum seekers to receive the protection to which they are entitled under international law.I welcome the fact that this Bill is before the House. A modern, progressive migration system is long overdue and must be separate from asylum in terms of process and policy. We have been playing catch-up on many fronts, both in terms of refugees and asylum, and on economic migration policy but it is now beginning to take shape and as it does, Members of this House and Ministers across all Departments must see around corners and put in place measures to integrate and make welcome the new arrivals. That will not happen by chance. It is a function of Government policy across all those Departments that have an impact on the people who arrive here and who have diverse and different needs to be serviced. We must start planning for the best way forward in terms of integration policy.Because we are starting late compared with the rest of Europe, we can have the benefit of others' hindsight. We have a small population by any standard, although it has risen above 4 million for the first time since 1871. Our birth rate is above the EU average and our inward migration is steady and healthy, given our needs. This demographic change poses challenges here in housing, education and health. Across all Departments wise people should plan for the best outcomes, hopefully without the help of consultants. In terms of integration many, indeed most, will become Irish citizens. In regard to integration we should emulate the United States rather than the United Kingdom or other countries. These newcomers must in time feel proud to be Irish, as well as proud of their former countries. They should have an allegiance to Ireland if they are to become citizens here and live with us permanently. Integration need not mean absorption and abandonment of their culture but their allegiance must be to Ireland.I would not like to see large ethnic groups living in a parallel world within Ireland. We have seen the dangers posed by fundamentalist Islam in the United Kingdom for example. We must be vigilant in this regard and avoid the ghettoisation of ethnic and religious groups here where grievance and a sense of disconnectedness from Ireland, the host country, and its institutions can foment.Irish-Americans and other ethnic groups in the United States are first and foremost Americans. They swear allegiance to that great country yet never relinquish their ethnic identity and race memory of their homeland. I would like the new Irish here to cleave to and show allegiance to our nation, to enjoy the benefits of our new prosperity and opportunity. That happy outcome requires far-thinking and progressive ministerial planning now.

I come to the debate wearing a second hat because the leader of Fine Gael asked me a couple of years ago to do whatever is humanly possible for the undocumented Irish immigrants in the United States, and to deal with the problems of Irish citizens in the United Kingdom.It is strange that so many people forget where they came from. I do not recall my grandfather but I was often told that he was one of those who emigrated for six months every year from north Galway to the potato fields of Scotland. Those people worked in the worst conditions. Their sleeping quarters were next to the horse in the farmyard. That was their place in the social order. They were within half a mile of the boss's house and were treated no better, and maybe worse, than the farm animals. I never want to see anybody on Irish soil being treated like that for whatever reason.Every sovereign state must have certain controls. No one can argue with that. It would be a bad Government that did not ensure the important checks and balances were in place. They exist in every country I know of, although in some they might not be strong enough.The Minister has got a few elements of the Bill right. The idea of a quota system for people outside the European Union to match the vacancies we cannot fill internally is a good one. Few will fault the Minister on that idea, irrespective of where they come from. That is acceptable because the Minister is saying we will take in as many people from outside the EU as we need to ensure that our economy works to its maximum capability.Some economists say that in the next few years our growth will be in the region of 4% or 5% of GDP. While I am not an economist I recall the trouble that arose when there was almost no increase in GDP. When that happened we exported workers. Far from exporting 65,000 people we are importing them. Everybody who spoke today mentioned the same figure. That is the number we need to keep our economy going. If we must do this and the economy cannot function any other way we must ensure we get the type of workers with the skills we need. If I am correct, that is what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill.There is, however, a fundamental flaw in the Bill. I assume that on Committee Stage the Minister will explain in detail why he could not ensure that the work permit is the sole responsibility of the worker. I do not understand that because when I was on Capitol Hill this year, and on other occasions, I made a strong case for something equivalent to the Morrison visa for the 50,000 undocumented Irish in America — we do not want anything less for our people. During our debate on this matter last Thursday the Minister for Foreign Affairs said he will be in America next month and that anything less than a full recognition of our rights as Irish people in America is not suitable. I share that view. These people go out to work every day and in that way have an allegiance to the country in which they live. They could be the Minister's brothers and mine, our sons and daughters. Why would we offer something less to other people in our country? I cannot understand that decision.The Minister must have some reason for ensuring that the permit goes to the employer. There are many immigrants in east Galway, most of them working in the hospitality sector and similar jobs. I have no doubt that the employers exploited those people under the old scheme. The situation is different now. At least the workers will receive copies of their permits. They will be in a better position under this Bill than they were last week.The Minister, however, has stopped short of a right that every human being should have. It is necessary to place oneself in their shoes given where we come from. Why should any employer have an advantage over the workers? Would not all the other balances and checks provided for in this Bill work just as well if the permit went directly to the worker? Many people studying this Bill will wonder why the Minister did that.From the point of view of human dignity, I cannot understand why the permit does not go to the person concerned. The Minister has invited these people into the State because we want them. They would not be here unless they were needed, met all the criteria in this Bill and were wanted by an employer. Why can they not be treated as ordinary workers? I do not understand why the Minister stopped short. I am sure the matter will arise a thousand times on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will get a chance to address it.There is another matter which is very important to us. Let us return to the situation in which many Irish people find themselves in America. There is no doubt that the American economy and way of life have much to recommend them. Many Irish people currently undocumented in the United States say that they could return to Ireland — a wonderful thing to hear — and get as good a job as they have in America. People ask me why I get hot under the collar about the problem of the undocumented in America, since they could come home. It is not at all simple because they emigrated voluntarily to become part of that economy. Many of them married American citizens. They like the system there, which to be honest is easy enough to do. There are many positive aspects to American living. Deputy O'Donnell and others referred to the allegiances people can have, first to their country of origin, the flag under which they were born, and then to their new country. Many of the undocumented Irish have told me that they could return home and be as well off financially but that they love America.All of us in the Oireachtas will have to try to effect this. Let us hope that those who come to Ireland from all over the world will form the same view of this country as the Irish have of America and like being here. Let us hope that they will be treated as equals. That is why I do not understand why the Minister is trying to hand-trip them by selling them short regarding the permit. From the perspective of human dignity, it is theirs. It should be in their pocket and belong to no one else. However, the Minister is not allowing for that.There is another matter that I feel is very important and which I hope works for the Minister. It is one thing to pilot legislation through this House. As we have seen in so many other aspects of Irish life, if one is not able to enforce legislation, one would almost be as well off without it. Greed is a terrible thing and human nature being what it is, if unscrupulous employers get the chance, they will certainly make money on anyone's back, not just immigrants. I am sure that the Minister will remember or have heard people talk of the fact that some of the hardest and meanest employers for whom Irish emigrants ever worked in Birmingham, London or Luton were themselves Irishmen who owned the companies in question. There is no reason to believe that one will not get employers in this country taking advantage of people who cannot speak the language and have almost no friends.It must be as lonesome as anything in the world for a person from Moscow who knows no one and is unable to speak a word of English to walk down Grafton Street or, if he or she gets the chance to visit the country, to walk through the little village of Mountbellew in County Galway from where I come. Unless he or she has a few friends in tow, it must be the most lonesome place in the world. Many Irish people forget that.I concur with much of what I have heard today. However, there is a fair degree of intolerance. People representing the city constituencies would know much more about this than I. For whatever reason, I see remarkable similarities between intolerance shown towards immigrants and that shown towards Travellers. Whomever else people wish to have living beside them, they do not want a Traveller or an immigrant. That is a serious matter.I sincerely hope that however this develops over the years, we will ensure that we cut out the rogue employers. It goes without saying that anyone who comes here from outside the State will also have responsibilities. When in Rome, one does as the Romans, and in Ireland there are laws enacted by these Houses that we expect people to acknowledge. That is the other side of the equation.I hope that this Bill represents a step in the right direction. Since they always went to an English-speaking country when they went abroad, the Irish did not have what I see as one of the greatest problems and disadvantages facing immigrants to this country. The proximity of the United Kingdom is one thing but one could not say that we were near the United States or Australia. Their great advantage was that the inhabitants spoke English. From an educational viewpoint, for an efficient workplace where migrants are employed, there should be great emphasis on teaching them the language. They must be given an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of English. Some people in this country would ask why we do not teach them Irish. We will not get into that. English is the lingua franca.Many years ago as a young lad I was an educational officer with Macra na Feirme. It was just before 1970, a time when this country was getting ready for integration into the European Community. We were taken on a fact-finding trip to Brussels which we thought was miles away at the time. For young lads who had not left the country too often, it was a major experience. I remember saying to myself that it was a good job that we had someone with us who spoke a relevant foreign language or we would not have been able to get the train to go to the airport, so culturally poor were we. We were no different from most people at that time.However, imagine those who have had no formal education, good, bad or indifferent, who have no friends and are simply floating through the world. That is essentially what some immigrants are doing. Against that, back-up services will have to be on a grand scale. Whatever can be done educationally, it is extremely important that they get the best chance.Regarding the inspectorate, I have no idea whether the number to be employed by the Minister is enough. I am not able to adjudicate on that. However, I know that if there are employers who think that they will not be covered or that the inspectorate is so thinly spread that the chances of anyone ever calling or checking up on them are slim, they will act accordingly. There are some very fine employers in this country and I know workers from Russia, Poland and Nigeria who tell me that they are very well looked after. However, others tell me that they are given the meanest jobs and paid a pittance. They hardly know what they earn in a week. As far as I know from the few who have come to me, they have no salary or wage slip of any description. That is typical of what is taking place. However they operate, I hope the inspectors will be busy, particularly in the first two or three years after the new system is in place. If rogue employers come to understand they will be penalised swiftly, the message will go out and there will not be so many of these types of problems in future.In comparison with colleagues in more urban constituencies, I have had a limited number of requests regarding migrant workers' rights from constituents in east Galway. In attempting to obtain information from the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have learned to appreciate the privilege only enjoyed by 166 people in this State, namely, the ability to table a parliamentary question. Without this facility, searches for this type of information would mean spending so much time on the telephone I would hardly be able to do anything else. As it is, one often has difficulty getting through to either Department on questions of this nature. I am one of a privileged 166 out of a total population of some 4 million. I can imagine the difficulties experienced by a person in Clonakilty, Ballinasloe or Dublin with poor or no English trying to ascertain information about their rights by telephoning one of the relevant Departments. None of us would endure such difficulty for long.The system has been diabolical in the past, with people experiencing tremendous difficulty in getting through to Departments, but there has been some improvement in this regard. That progress must be expedited. Departmental employees dealing with such inquiries should consider whether an Irish person receiving similar treatment in Poland or Russia would be content. There are some in this country who have long since forgotten our own history of migration. The frontline staff who deal with inquiries from migrant workers should bear that in mind. The progress that has been made must continue.

Deputy Howlin summed it up earlier when he said it is a Bill more suited than most to Committee Stage because there are many fine points to consider. In general, it seems to be a Bill about which everybody has some positive comments to make. It has been a long time coming. As far back as five years ago, there was an awareness of the difficulties arising from the fact that permits were in the hands of employers rather than employees. That situation is now being rectified and we are working to empower workers and secure their rights.I begin by noting that I often have reason to complain about the drafting of Bills. I have some small amount of legal training but I find it incredibly difficult to read some sections, in particular section 2 which replaces parts of section 2 of the 2003 Act. More effort could be made to simplify the manner in which legislative provisions are expressed.In view of our long history of emigration, Bills such as this have a particular importance. It would be a pity if our modern laws ignored the sad history of migration from this country. In this context, it is important that we deal not merely with the nuts and bolts of migration policy but that we also safeguard the dignity of workers and ensure they feel welcome. Policy should be based on this welcoming imperative apart altogether from the specific rights set out in this Bill.We have experienced net immigration from non-English speaking countries for the last several years and this is creating social changes. We cannot go into this blind and it is insufficient to deal only with the issue of permits. We must consider the economic and cultural impact of all this change. An important issue in this regard is the question of migrant workers being joined by their families.We are in the fortunate position of being a "new country" in terms of net immigration. We can learn the lessons from other countries which have already experienced such migration, going back to the United States in the 19th century and western Europe in the last century. The system in place is quite clear and the proposed changes represent a vast improvement.One area of caution relates to student permits. Thousands of people have been granted such permits which generously allow the holder to engage in 20 hours of paid work per week. It would be foolish not to acknowledge that many of these permit holders work far more than 20 hours per week and, as such, are important players in the economy. Future legislation must deal with the transition from student to work permits. At present, people with student permits must return home when their permit has expired and apply for a work permit. This is a bureaucratic solution to a practical problem and it should be regularised.A famous meeting took place in Tampere in Finland in 1999 at which attempts were made to devise an EU-wide migration policy. In the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States security became the dominant theme of discussions on migration and, as a result, there was no progress for a long period. The need for skilled workers in the European economy is well recognised. Many commentators have spoken about the greying of the population in western Europe — although this is less apparent in Ireland — and the need to bring in workers from non-EEA countries so that we can continue to generate the wealth required to fund the social requirements of an older population.We must encourage the migration of skilled workers for the maximum benefit of the economy. However, statistics indicate that 75% of work permit holders are engaged in unskilled occupations. This is a problem because we should be targeting highly skilled workers rather than simply catering to the areas of highest demand. It seems many of the permit holders working in unskilled areas are well educated or skilled in other areas. A pattern is emerging where people are coming to Ireland to work in unskilled jobs, whether in restaurants, as au pairs and so on, with a view to climbing the skills ladder subsequently and finding permanent work in an area in which they are trained. This is an issue that should be considered in the context of this Bill and in terms of the objectives of our immigration policy. The theory is that the work permit holder is supposed to return once the temporary need he or she has met no longer exists. In reality, however, many of them remain. Not only are they staying here but their families are coming to Ireland to reunify. There is some provision for that in the Bill and it is welcome.One of the criticisms of the permanent migration policy, the green card system, is that a person is allowed to come into the country because the Department recognises the high demand area or an area that needs future skills as identified by Forfás. By its nature, the Department will be slow to react to new areas of high demand. A provision in the Bill allows the Department to review this issue every two years. I suggest there should be a continuous review of the high areas of demand and changes made accordingly.In Israel low-skilled immigrant labourers are required to save a part of their earnings which is returned to them in bulk when they leave to create movement. That is not practical here. Once migrant labour is welcomed into the country one has to allow for the possibility that they may want to remain and that there will be reunification with their families. This is the reality on the ground, it is how Irish migration developed in America and England. People went out for specific jobs, their families followed and, sadly, whole parishes emptied in many cases.In the Joint Committee on European Affairs recently we discussed human trafficking. At that meeting the old work permit system was criticised. Unfortunately, much human trafficking is occurring on the strength of properly issued work permits which were then retained under the previous system. The criticism I heard last week of the Bill, however, as it relates to human trafficking is not fair. Trafficking is a matter for the Garda and immigration officials.SIPTU has indicated the need for more resources for labour inspectors to ensure rights are not being ignored. Section 21 provides for the appointment of authorised officers. Section 21(4) provides that an authorised officer may at all reasonable times enter any premises, place or vehicle while the various subsections grant extraordinary powers to those officers. A person can refuse to allow an authorised officer to enter his or her premises but will then face a warrant to allow for the searching of the premises. The Garda Síochána Bill requires that the ombudsman give notice to a Garda sergeant in charge before entering a station to carry out a search but there is no similar provision in this Bill. The Bill should provide for a notice period so the investigation may take place in a proper and less dramatic fashion.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	376	This Bill is important and timely because of the huge changes that have occurred in Irish society during the past ten to 15 years. Ireland has moved from being a country which has experienced years of emigration to being a country which now has net immigration. Most who had to emigrate had no choice, it was down to hard economic facts. To survive people had to leave Ireland.It is amazing how easily and how quickly that harsh economic fact can be forgotten. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s a large proportion of young people of Ireland had no choice but to leave and work abroad. Counties Sligo and Leitrim were hit as badly as any others. We suffered not only from emigration but many of our young people moved to Dublin and the east coast.Today, however, we have the reverse. As Ireland continues to develop and prosper we have the relatively new phenomenon of immigration. Not only is there net immigration but the numbers coming to Ireland are quite staggering. In the past five years more than 110,000 non-European Economic Area nationals started employment in the State. Non-European Economic Area nationals are those from outside the EU and a few other European countries such as Norway and Switzerland. Last night I noticed quite a number of Swiss nationals in Dublin. I was glad to see them here as tourists but I take this opportunity to wish the Irish team every luck this evening.The changes in our workforce have resulted in huge challenges in how we operate our employment legislation, hence the need for this Bill. It is important that our policy is consistent and fair to the migrant workers who come to Ireland and to Irish workers and indigenous firms. The right balance is needed and this legislation goes a long way towards achieving that.Migrant workers can be in a particularly vulnerable position as alluded to by previous speakers. It is important that their experience of working in Ireland is mutually beneficial. Nobody, employer or fellow employee, should be allowed exploit that vulnerability. If it were not for the skills that migrant workers bring to this country the economic success that we have experienced during the past eight to ten years would not have occurred.The basic philosophy underlying any market policy must be to identify labour and skills shortages and to match those shortages with people who are suitably qualified. This is not a static situation, it is constantly changing as the needs of the country evolve. One day the shortage may be in the construction sector while another day it may be in the services sector. Our legislation must have the ability to respond rapidly and fairly to any changes required.All the economic indicators show there will continue to be expansion and growth in the economy, hence the number of workers required will continue to increase. The challenge facing us is to ensure that workers with the right skills are available for the appropriate jobs. I welcome the research that has been carried out by the expert group for future skills needs and Forfás which will be finalised shortly. This work is vital in identifying where shortages occur or will occur in the economy and will suggest how those shortages might be tackled and matched by appropriately qualified workers.Protection of the migrant worker is important. I welcome the fact that employers will be prohibited from deducting any costs from the pay of any worker that may be incurred in recruiting that worker. It also prohibits the retention of personal documents such as passports by the employer.One of the major intentions of the Bill is to introduce a green card system for highly skilled migrant workers. In my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, there are many highly skilled workers from outside the EEA working in the health service. I welcome the Bill as it is based on skills which will benefit the economy and also allow new immigrants an opportunity to use their skills to the best of their ability.However, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to some difficulties which exist for migrant workers. Perhaps with some co-operation between his Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform these difficulties might be overcome. Many of the skilled workers who come to Ireland work in the health service. It has been said that were it not for the non-EU doctors, nurses and paramedics much of our health service would stop functioning. This is particularly true for the general hospitals all over the country that are not directly associated with universities or teaching hospitals. These doctors and nurses are in their late 20s, 30s, or early 40s and frequently have families. Unfortunately, it can be difficult for family members to come and visit or stay in the case of immediate family members.Recently I came across a case of a highly specialised nurse in Sligo General Hospital who was having great difficulty in getting her husband and young daughter into Ireland. The worry of the sister in charge of the unit in which the nurse worked was that this nurse, with specialised skills, would be enticed to work across the water in the United Kingdom where her immediate family would be accommodated and thereby her skills would be lost to our health service. I realise this particular problem lies more in the realm of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform where, I am glad to say, it was eventually resolved. However, better co-operation between Departments would have prevented all the difficulties. In the case of these highly skilled workers for whom we are canvassing abroad, there should be some built-in mechanism to anticipate and resolve these difficulties.The Bill, when enacted, will allow the Minister to introduce regulations on the qualification criteria by which people will be granted permits. For example, the use of a salary cut-off point has been mentioned for highly skilled workers. I am not too sure that this would be the best criterion on which to operate. It may be that skills or educational qualifications would be a fairer method for determining entitlement to a work permit. Perhaps the Minister might consider that idea in more detail on Committee Stage.I am aware of the comments of the Immigration Council of Ireland concerning this Bill, which were generally in favour of it. I hope a fuller discussion and teasing out of some of the points to which I have alluded will be possible on Committee Stage, resulting in worthwhile legislation. I congratulate the Minister on bringing this measure before us and I commend the Bill to the House.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about this important Bill. The legislation covers a wide spectrum in providing for the application, grant, renewal, refusal and revocation of employment permits. We should debate how the system has worked in the past and how it should operate in future. As the Minister said in his speech, we have a unique situation in that we are now dealing with immigration rather than emigration. I am old enough to remember large-scale emigration when our people left this island and were allowed to work in the UK, the USA, Australia and elsewhere.We are now talking about immigration rather than mass emigration, which represents a massive change. We can be proud of where we have come from, but we must ensure our regulations and laws are such that everyone, whether Irish-born or not, receives fair treatment. The lack of fair treatment is causing many problems in the work force, which often spill over into social life. We see that happening all too often and sometimes ending in tragedy. We need to ensure people understand each other and are given the same treatment.Many Irish workers feel their jobs are being undermined because migrant workers have been exploited. There is no doubt about it and we know that from past history. Many Irish workers have made genuine complaints to me and to other public representatives that they are no longer wanted, but their anxieties are not recognised. In larger manufacturing plants the workforce is changing dramatically. I have heard of situations where a few migrant workers were engaged initially, but later they constituted half or three quarters of the workforce. Irish workers feel that some of these workers were employed at lower wage levels, thus putting their own jobs at risk. That is why it is so important to treat everyone equally.The technicalities of the Bill have been dealt with already by our party's spokespersons and they will be dealt with in further detail in the remaining stages. I wish to refer to a few details that have direct links to the immigration issue. For some years, quite a number of asylum seekers have been looked after in locations such as St. Patrick's College, Monaghan and at Mosney in County Meath. The problem is that they are not allowed to work, which in turn causes resentment. That is part of the background to the misplaced arguments against migrant workers who become confused in the public mind with asylum seekers who have been here for so long.Many hard-pressed mothers often come into my constituency office to complain that they cannot get a taxi service to bring their children to hospital from rural areas where there is no public transport, yet foreigners — as they class them — can get taxis to Dublin or elsewhere under the asylum procedures. Many such people who are seeking Irish citizenship are only too willing to work if given a chance to do so. They should be given work permits for one, two or three months. Some asylum seekers who have been staying in St. Patrick's College in Monaghan for a long period are not allowed to wash their own dishes, which is demoralising for them and a bad example to their families.There should be a once-off amnesty for these people. We have good restrictions on others coming in, so we could allow such an amnesty once. It would not be unrealistic to do so at this time when the Government and Opposition parties are seeking an amnesty or special derogation for Irish people who are living and working in the United States without the necessary permits. Since the new regulations were introduced in the United States as a result of the events on 11 September 2001, many Irish people have found themselves in an impossible situation. They cannot return home for weddings, funerals or other occasions. They even find it difficult to obtain driving licences. Since we all agree that it is important to get this situation sorted out for Irish citizens in America, I find it difficult to accept that we cannot do the same for others, many of whom cannot return to their own homes in safety. I heard Deputy O'Donnell talking about such situations in Africa and elsewhere, including the desperate trauma that people suffer. I also heard Deputy Connaughton describing how his forefathers had emigrated to Scotland.I have had to deal with asylum seekers in Castleblayney and elsewhere but I find it difficult to explain to them why they have been left waiting for three years. Although they are willing and able to work, even in a voluntary capacity, they are not allowed to obtain work permits. If they were earning money and paying their way, they would not be regarded by others as leeches on the community. It would certainly prevent some of the misgivings and misunderstandings that currently exist.If our economy continues to grow at its current level, it is clear we will need continued immigration but we must ensure the system works. At times, I have questioned the regulations and controls concerning what workers can come here. For instance, in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, where we have no means of transport other than by road, lorry drivers are often in great demand but not easily found. On a number of occasions, I raised the issue of haulage companies with the Minister's predecessor. Such companies had an opportunity to hire South African drivers but were advised that they could not do so since drivers are available from eastern Europe. It is important to point out that South African drivers are used to driving on the left-hand side of the road and also speak English, which is important for Irish and UK deliveries. This is just one area where there should be more flexibility, thus leading to less road accidents.I welcome the Bill's provision giving employees more freedom to work where they wish. We can never allow a situation to recur such as occurred with Gama Construction or more recently with Irish Ferries. In recent days Gama Construction signed a major roads contract in my constituency. It is vital that we not only introduce regulations to monitor how it and others treat their employees but also that we have the inspectors to enforce the law. It is not sufficient to promise to increase the number of inspectors. It is important that they have the finance and wherewithal to operate. I am not being political but factual. In 1989 the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Michael O'Kennedy, introduced laws regarding meat and bonemeal, which was the right thing to do at the time. However, unfortunately no inspectorate was ever appointed until we found ourselves with BSE in 1996. It was only then, seven years later, that inspectors were appointed and paid to do a job that could have saved the country a considerable amount of money. In light of those issues I raise this matter and I do not do so in a party political way. It is important that we have the personnel to control the laws we are about to pass.It is public knowledge how Gama Construction used ingenious schemes to pay unfortunate workers a pittance while they built the country's infrastructure. Not one person has been punished for this disgraceful treatment of workers. What additional resources will be made available to the labour inspectorate and other bodies that will enforce the legislation? How does the Department intend to communicate these new rights to migrant workers? I heard previous speakers refer to the language issue. Many of these people do not have a good grasp of the English language and may not be fully aware of their rights. On the other hand I am told by employers that many of them have a good grasp of the language and certainly know their entitlements. Who will co-operate with the foreign embassies to ensure these rights are translated into meaningful improvements for migrant workers upon entry to the country? It is important for Irish workers that migrant workers are not exploited and that they are all seen to be on the same level. If we are entitled to bring in workers and pay them, we must ensure that the house with which they are provided is not used as a means to halve their wages. All those issues must be addressed, which can only happen if we have an appropriate labour inspectorate.If we are to see migrant workers as part of the Irish culture in the future, as Deputy Devins said, we must address the issue of the family. While I appreciate that it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it is a matter for the Government. If people are good enough to come here and fill vital vacancies as nurses, doctors or in other areas, they should have the right to bring their spouses and rear their families here. In our history those who emigrated to work in the US or the UK had a legal right to bring their families.I will mention one case that seems curious. Of eight workers in one company, six successfully applied to have their wives join them and in some cases their children. However, two workers failed. Those two worked in the same company on the same wages and come from the same country. It is very hard to understand how such a thing can happen. In another case a young man had been working for three years in a relatively good job with a house supplied. He failed in his application to get his wife to join him even though his friend, whose job was not so good, was facilitated. If we are to respect the families of migrant workers we must consider this issue seriously. In one case a migrant worker was refused permission to bring his wife and children here for a short holiday in spite of being prepared to give sureties.We should encourage migrant workers to become involved in the community, church and sporting activities so that they can become part of the Irish structure. If we fail to do so we will have serious problems of social exclusion etc. Some families coming here may need special education etc. We need to work together not just in employment but in education, health, justice and so on.I noted some points of the Minister's speech with interest. As a farmer dealing with some of the bureaucracy that we had been promised would be eliminated, I could not help highlighting one comment the Minister made about job offers. He stated: "Our system will be simple and transparent, rather than complex and bureaucratic." I hope this is the case not just for the Minister's sake but for everybody's. Small companies that find it hard to develop and stay in business have the greatest difficulty in getting migrant workers through the system. The bigger companies that can afford to utilise intermediaries can get the number of workers they need without any problem. This was the case even at a time when migrant workers were not supposed to be permitted here. While this does not reflect personally on the Minister, I have found it difficult to contact the Department. If it is difficult for me to get through, how much more difficult must it be for someone with poor English. These matters need to be addressed and clarified.In general I welcome the Bill. It is vital that migrant workers are permitted to enter the country. I challenge the way asylum seekers are being treated. I raise the matter in a genuine manner and am not trying to stir matters politically. The issue could be addressed very quickly and eliminated once and for all. If the backlog could be addressed, new asylum seekers could be dealt with quickly. In the case of my friend in Castleblaney, she has been there for three years with her children. They had settled into school and one of them was about to do examinations. They were suddenly deported. For a country that claims to be Christian based, that is not a compassionate way to operate. While I do not suggest that we should have an open-door policy, we should find a way to deal with this issue once and for all. The permits system exists for those wanting to enter the country. The small number of permits that would clear that issue would allow us to get on with other business.In general I agree with the Bill and I hope any matters that need to be amended will be addressed in a constructive way on Committee Stage.
#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. As a trade unionist for most of my adult life and as a person who had to emigrate in the past, I may be able to make a few worthwhile comments and possibly put a slightly different perspective on some of the issues raised.I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation because it is important and timely for the individuals involved. If anything it is overdue. Some people will question the need for the legislation and there have already been suggestions that we have adequate worker protection and labour legislation in place. It has even been suggested to me that we are becoming a nanny state, over-regulated in different aspects of our lives. I disagree with that generalisation. Deputy Joe Higgins highlighted one relevant case and more recently the attempt by Irish Ferries to drive a coach and four not alone through worker protection but through wage agreements and redundancy laws clearly indicates the need for this type of legislation.If Irish Ferries thinks that Irish workers are unsuitable for its operation, it may be time for the travelling Irish public to consider if that company is suitable for its purposes, namely travel. Boycotts have worked in the past. I would not use this House to suggest to anyone that a boycott be put in place but anyone who goes to the lengths to which Irish Ferries has gone, to try to break every agreement that has ever been made, should be severely dealt with.From my involvement in many issues regarding redundancy, the rule has always been that it is the job which must be redundant. That rule is important, and sacrosanct. If it is not upheld, there is nothing to stop any employer from dispensing with the services of any employee and replacing him or her with a cheaper or younger substitute. We contest such actions vigorously because all our laws and protections in the area have been based on a certain set of beliefs, one of which involves the redundancy issue.Greed will always be prevalent in industry and business. We regularly experience and read about cases of tax fraud, failure to pay pension contributions, to comply with health and safety regulations and so on. People who indulge in such practices will certainly exploit any opportunity they see, particularly if it involves potentially cheaper labour, be it involving non-nationals, people tied to single employer work permits and so on.It is important therefore that we step in. As legislators it is our responsibility to ensure we have adequate laws in place and that we close any loopholes which are highlighted. No matter how carefully legislation is drafted, there will always be people to exploit sections of it. We need to be able to move speedily to cut them off. Bad examples such as seen at Irish Ferries and the Gama Construction company will give us a bad name and create great friction between the trade unions representing workers at all levels, the Government and State, and employers.Section 22 in particular of this Bill affords protection to migrant workers. Its prohibition on deducting recruitment-related costs from the employees' wages and also retaining employees' personal documents by the employer is long overdue. It is many years since the truck Acts and other legislation prohibited this type of exploitation of workers by employers. Because of our history we should be more conscious than most of how people can be exploited. We had bonded or tithed workers and so on. Many of the current situations are close to slavery. If someone is tied to an employer, regardless of conditions that is totally unacceptable. That happened with work permits. People were afraid to complain and had no outlet. They must have a legal basis for complaints and it is timely that we move in this area.Unfortunately, because of the current set-up, many migrants have found themselves in the Irish worker situation that obtained in the bad old days. Retention of work and other documents, the refusal to pay properly-agreed wage rates, the exploitation of workers, failure to supply details of wages earned and excessive charges for accommodation and food have been par for the course in some cases, though not in all. These abuses occurred in big companies as well as small, and it was not only individuals who were exploited.Some colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas may not fully understand how easy it is for an employer to exploit workers travelling from foreign countries. They may not appreciate the difficulties such workers face when arriving in a strange country, especially if there is a language barrier. Those of us who had to leave and go to work abroad in the past will understand that difficulty and appreciate the conditions hidden in contracts which can make it very difficult to leave one company or one job, particularly on construction sites and so on. We can also see the excessive charges made for accommodation and are aware of how people can be exploited in that regard, when one finds those charges are tied into one's work contract.Most of us will understand the resentment that can arise from the feeling that someone is coming from outside to take local jobs, and that feeling can be experienced in any country, but especially in one of high unemployment. Deputy Crawford referred to it and said many workers felt their jobs were being undermined. That sentiment may not be too obvious when everything is going well and a feeling of security exists, but when matters deteriorate, or there is a suggestion of such deterioration, people become concerned and usually take it out on the outsiders, as they see them and describe them.In that context it is important that we give a fair and accurate account of how we are doing in terms of employment, and with regard to the forecasts for the economy. Failure to do so could affect the people covered under this legislation by creating a totally false impression of how we are doing in terms of employment. Deputy Crawford referred to this issue. I am glad he is present. The Fine Gael spokesman responsible for this portfolio leaves a lot to be desired in that regard. Deputy Crawford is forecasting a very bright future, saying we will need immigrants and must have them, while the Fine Gael spokesman may have been trying to sow the seeds of disharmony with false forecasts. That could make people unduly concerned and create a great deal of unnecessary worry, and reaction against outsiders working in this country.Lest anyone accuse me of providing false information on the issues, I will give a couple of examples of forecasts where the Fine Gael spokesman took a sort of "Crocodile Dundee" approach to the facts. On 15 July 2003, Deputy Hogan said it was reasonable to assume that in that year we would see negative growth in the Irish economy. In fact, the economy continued to grow in 2003, with GNP up 2.8% and GDP up by 3.7%. I asked for these figures in order to have a correct record because this is an important aspect of our debate.In talking up a jobs crisis on 4 July 2003, Deputy Hogan said:By the end of this year, enough people will become unemployed to fill Croke Park to two and a half times its capacity. We are now heading for over 200,000 unemployed by the end of this year.In fact, unemployment figures rose to just over 170,000 at the end of 2003. It fell in 2004 and according to the most recent statistics, that is, for the year to March 2005, the economy created a new job every seven and a half minutes.The next quotation is a real beauty. On 4 September 2003, the Deputy stated: "Unemployment has reverted to pre-Celtic tiger levels." In fact, unemployment in September 2003 was at 4.4%, significantly less than half the 10.7% rate inherited from the rainbow Government in 1997. On 10 February 2004, the Deputy said that Youghal's narrow loss of 2,000 new jobs to Slovakia and the loss of 50 existing jobs in Offaly to Latvia and the Far East — he picked his targets well — marked a new low for the Irish economy. In fact, unemployment in the first quarter of 2004 was 4.5% and in the first quarter of 2005 it was 4.2%. More than 70,000 jobs were created in the year after Deputy Hogan made his prediction.On 17 February 2004, he said any talk of an economic recovery is dampened by FÁS's prediction that employment will grow at half the rate predicted by the Government in the budget. This will result in "the lowest rate of job creation in 12 years". However, in the year after the Deputy made his comment, the number of persons in employment grew by 72,400 to reach 1,908,300 in the first quarter of 2005. This was the highest level of annual growth, at 3.9%, recorded since the fourth quarter of 2000. On 6 February 2004, he said "the level of notified redundancies for 2004 will reach new heights". In fact, notified redundancies fell by 16% in 2004. On 15 September that year he said the Government "does not care that jobs are being lost". In the year after he made that comment, however, the number of persons in employment grew by 93,000 to reach 1,929,200 in the second quarter of 2005. It is the highest annual growth rate, at 5%, recorded since the second quarter of 2000.It is important to mention these comments not just for point scoring but because Irish workers, as Deputy Crawford said, feel their jobs are being undermined. They feel that way because of scaremongering. The record is available to be checked but this type of talk creates a difficulty for people who come to this country to work. It creates a sense of fear among people who are in employment and are concerned. We cannot allow it to continue. The false forecasts must be taken seriously. They also create a false picture of the economy. This country is doing exceptionally well by any measurement. The OECD and all economic groups will agree with that. Talking down the economy is also happening in other areas. These spokespeople should not be allowed to run with such false propaganda. It is not good for people in employment or for the country.I agree with the point made by Deputies Devins and Crawford that families joining workers is an area of concern, particularly with regard to health. This country is at least as difficult, if not more so, than the USA to deal with in regard to getting people into this country, getting them a visa and allowing them to join their families. However, I believe the experience of migrant workers has been positive, with the possible exceptions mentioned earlier and some other individual cases involving housekeepers and similar workers that have been highlighted. The vast majority of cases have worked successfully and we should encourage that.The USA found that the best way of dealing with illegal employment, as it was described, was to go after the employer, not the employee. The fact that future abuses of section 22 in this Bill could result in fines of up to €50,000 or up to five years in jail should help to ensure that such abuses are stopped.There is no need for Irish workers to resent immigrants arriving here to work, as long as proper controls and systems are in place. That is the objective of this Bill. It is the false information and the stirring of the pot, as it were, as well as the lack of proper legislation and conditions that cause problems for people. The country is doing well but I am mindful of an old saying of my late mother's, "Do we think we will never again see a poor day?" We need to be ollamh and properly prepared to control the situation. This and the last Governments have created a positive situation. There are exceptional levels of growth. However, none of that happened by accident and false attempts to talk it down will not change that fact. It is on the record.With regard to the use of the term "green cards" in the Bill, perhaps it is not the best name as it could be confused with the American system. I do not know what they have in common but it might be better to use a different name. There is a need for this initiative but it must be monitored. Deputy Devins dealt well with that issue. As a medical practitioner, he is aware of the situations that arise. Deputy Crawford pointed out how it could be misused for certain people. Nevertheless, we should have a range of initiatives and opportunities for people who need employment and who need to send money home to their families and into their home economies. I have been in that situation. I have experienced having to work in countries where one feels that others think one is taking their job. I can empathise with immigrants to this country.I am also aware of the difficulties. Trade unions will protect their members but unless the trade unions seek them out and encourage them to become members immigrants will feel isolated and at a disadvantage, particularly if there is a language barrier. We should remember that many Irish people are in a legal limbo in the USA, unable to come home for family weddings or funerals. They are terrified of getting sick and having to go into the mainstream system. I hope the Kennedy and McCain legislation will regularise their situation in the near future. We should remember them if we are tempted to criticise this Bill. Many of our own, some of them relations, are in the same situation in the USA. They went there because they needed to get a job and were unable to get one here. We must be conscious of the difficulties that can be faced by others.We should not become arrogant just because we have become wealthier. Most of us are far better off than we ever were, although some families still face difficulties. We should not become arrogant as a result. We should never look down on anybody because for a long time people looked down on us. We were seen as gombeen men and the like, particularly by our main neighbours. We should be conscious of the need to help. However, there is a need for controls and the Minister is conscious of that. Things could change and that should be catered for in the legislation. I am not part of the Deputy Hogan school of forecasting but we must be able to monitor and control the situation we create.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. I welcome aspects of the Bill but I would have preferred if the House were discussing this legislation along with or following the Government's proposals for an immigration and residence Bill. I see areas of overlap between the functions of the two Departments and between the two Bills.A practical problem arises from the drafting of these Bills. If one speaks about approved units of required labour, one will arrive at a very different set of conclusions than if one talks about workers' rights. I commend Deputy Dennehy's contribution and his reference to bonded labour, slavery and the Truck Acts; I totally agree with him. There are those who instead of speaking of the rights or workers, citizens and residents would like to have an uncontrolled situation of a low labour economy where workers' rights are stripped away. I hope such people hear a message from all sides of this House of deep disapproval for their actions and the attendant consequences.I would have preferred if the legislation relating to immigration and residence had been taken before this Bill and if the United Nations Convention on the Protection of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families had been discussed. This UN instrument was adopted in 1990 and signed by Ireland. It had a ratification requirement of 20 and entered into force in July 2003 having passed that ratification threshold. If the convention had been in force, it would have protected workers in a much more general sense. It refers to frontier workers who reside in a neighbouring state and deals with the issue of circular migration and seasonal workers. It contains a specific reference to seafarers employed on vessels registered in a state other than their own, which is currently germane. I do not wish to argue about the responsibilities of Ministers but the ratification of this convention would be of immense value.The convention also deals with an issue which will need to be addressed in any adequate immigration and residence Bill and it arises to some extent in the Minister's proposals — the information to which people are entitled. This Bill will deal with workplace information to which people are entitled but it would be ideal if this legislation was being run along with an adequate immigration and residence Bill because it could offer clarification and transparency on applications, appeals, social welfare rights and education rights.The United Nations Convention on the Protection of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families deals with such issues. Its attraction is that it goes beyond the narrow framework of a required and approved unit of labour. The importance of implementation is raised in this legislation and will arise in the other legislation.Those in charge of eliminating abuses or assuring compliance with the law relating to workers' rights are of the view that 50 inspectors are required. The Minister proposes 31 posts, an increase of 50% on the current complement of 21 inspectors but those charged with the responsibility for implementation have recommended a total of 50 inspectors.Many speakers have made the distinction between this proposal, which is effectively a labour visa programme, and a green card programme. There is a fundamental difference between the green card system of the United States, which gives one the opportunity to progress to permanence and be enabled to enter the society, and this programme. I stress the phrase "enter the society". There are those who argue that one should be able to recruit people for the economy without necessarily allowing them the full benefits of citizenship rights within the society. This is a perilous road to go and is contrary the best practice of evolving international law and migrant rights.How can we make a case for someone who accompanies a worker under this legislation? We argue in favour of the solidarity of family for good reasons in the case we are making for the Kennedy-McCain legislation.Many years ago I studied migration in my other life. Certain distinct changes took place in the pattern of migration. Pre-Famine migration from Ireland was circular in that people left for the season. Deputy Dennehy made a good point in his argument against those who scaremonger. He asked the House to remember that some of the bothy fires in Scotland were associated with a deep apprehension of the impact of Irish workers on agricultural wages. People migrated for seasonal work and on their return experienced a rise in costs and excessive interest charged by the gombeen class entering the grocery trade at the time.Migration to the United States began with the Famine. The major migrations were in the 1950s and between 1955 and 1960 more than one quarter of a million people emigrated, with the figure never dropping below 40,000 and usually nearer 60,000. In 1955 the figure was 58,000. This emigration was from rural areas, the people being lucky if they achieved primary school education. The males went into unskilled occupations and the females took up a broader range of occupations but mostly entered services.The emigration of the 1980s was entirely different as it was primarily urban-sourced involving people who had a higher level of education and there was a dispersal into a wider range of occupations. In the 1980s, circular migration had replaced the main pattern of emigration and became the predominant type. Circular migration means that people return rather than emigrating forever.People should be allowed be reunited with their families at significant events such as funerals, marriages and deaths, as was argued in the context of the Kennedy-McCain legislation. To be credible we should accord the same principle to those who come here. Who wants to say to people that they are allowed to come, not for five years but for two years and with no prospect of ever becoming permanent residents? In fact, if one was to seek to bring any of one's relatives here, one would run into the visa requirements of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who might well find that one's significant other is telling a cock and bull story at Dublin Airport and if he had time himself, he would go out to send him or her back home.We cannot have it both ways. I suggest that the fundamental principle is the one with which I began, namely that we talk about workers, their families and their rights, internationally. The discussion should be grounded and founded in rights. That is what is contained in the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. That is a convention that accepts the principles of many other conventions and deals with short-term workers and so forth. Our aim should be to ratify that convention, regard it as the bedrock and then move towards the Government's proposals for an Immigration and Residents Bill, where we will then be able to fit in the concerns of the economy. In other words, the needs of the economy should not be the starting point but should come far later, if one approaches this issue from a rights perspective.In the legislation as I read it — although we can tease this all out in the debate on Committee Stage — there is no transfer of access to employment to the employee. Effectively, as I understand it, the worker will be able to get a piece of paper indicating that he or she has permission to stay. Has that worker the right, for example, to initiate the application of another employer? I do not think so. The worker must find another employer who is willing to make an application.A further problem arises in that many migrant workers who would be regarded by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as illegal, or out-of-status people, are people who began here legally. Under the old system, where the employer got the permit, if a worker had any difficulty, he or she falls out of legal status. There were also many unscrupulous employers who took people on and told them that they were applying for a permit. They assured workers that they were applying for permits but during that time, such workers had no rights at all.There is an old, fundamental question that applies to this legislation as to why the dogs are not barking, given the absence of a stated opinion from IBEC. This legislation is somewhat soft with regard to the requirements it makes of IBEC. Frankly, the legislation as outlined is a description of a system of guest workers rather than a green card system, certainly by comparison with, for example, the Morrison system.I have said I welcome provisions in the legislation and do so wholeheartedly. The idea that an employer could take the papers of an employee, hold them and use them as a threat over the employee, is, and always was, outrageous. I would have gone farther in the legislation with regard to the regulation and sanctions for the contract worker sector, where some of the abuses of employees have been most acute.We are at a point where people on all sides of this House will have to decide where they stand on versions of the economy. In the United States last year, blue collar workers worked 240 hours longer than they did in the 1970s to retain the same purchasing power. If IBEC wants to engage in a confrontation with the people here, let us have it out in the open. I believe that IBEC is a disgrace, given its stated opinion on the Irish Ferries issue. I also believe that its behaviour regarding what happened in Aer Lingus, where people were effectively coerced out of their jobs, was quite disgraceful. IBEC did not dissociate itself from that situation. Nor has it been in a position to state that it does not run seminars providing information on how to get rid of employees or make them insecure.We have all had lectures on social partnership. The reason Irish workers have one of the highest rates of productivity in Europe is not only to do with wages but with the attitudes towards work and employment here. We cannot degrade work to the level of so-called units of labour, provided in a context without rights, which is what IBEC would like, ideally. If IBEC disagrees with that, it must show us the evidence. It is not only on these issues that the organisation has been silent. One only has to think of IBEC members in the Irish banking system, speaking of clean governance or corporate responsibility. Such words should turn to ashes in their mouths, given the appalling levels of high remuneration that non-executive directors are drawing from the banking sector, which nobody can justify. The average worker is asked what he or she is doing and the dignity of work is associated with the nature of productivity. However, it seems to me that for some people work is only a matter of what they can consume at the trough.It is encouraging to find that there are no people in this House standing up for this William Martin Murphy version of industrial relations. I welcome that. I also think that if the Government had ratified the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, it would be in a strong position to protect maritime workers. It is a great pity, if not a tragedy, that the Government was one of those that blocked a European directive prepared by the EU Commission that would have protected seafarers.On examining this legislation, one must bear in mind the nature of migration and recognise that we are dealing with a worldwide phenomenon. The International Organization for Migration has calculated that in any one year, 175 million migrants are moving in different parts of the world. This raises a fundamental issue if one is framing thinking and policy in this area. Capital is now able to move in real time, but migratory flows are slower. However, that does not mean one should give fewer rights to migrants. It simply means that the condition is more acute.I have outlined the aspects of the Bill that I welcome but it will, unfortunately, formalise a two-tier system. We will not be within an ass's roar of a rights perspective if we are giving different kinds of rights and very limited entitlements to people, based on income and salary. This is a visa system and not a green card system, certainly not by comparison with Bruce Morrison's approach. It is, in fact, a permit system. With regard to the initiation of the permit the Bill does not transfer rights fully to the employee. The employee is still stuck with the task of finding an employer. Furthermore, even when a non-national worker seeks a permit it is at the invitation of an employer. These are defects in the Bill.The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment referred in his speech to a labour market of 20 million and a labour force of 2 million. This fact makes it all the more urgent that we make it clear that when working in Ireland, people will be working in an environment and context in which there is appreciation of workers and guarantees of their rights. That is the position that we must ensure prevails here.Thankfully, there is no support for driving us down into a low-wage economy. Unfortunately, most of the abuses that have been noticed by the Immigrant Council of Ireland and others, have been perpetrated against very weak and vulnerable people. There have been outrageous abuses.I appeal for an adequate inspectorate. There is no point in stating that the inspectorate has increased by 50%, when it has only risen from 20 to 30 inspectors. The inspectors themselves say that the inspectorate needs a staff of 50 to do its job effectively. I appeal to the Minister to have such consultations as will implement the improvements suggested in the legislation between now and the Committee Stage debate.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the Employment Permits Bill. I listened carefully to many of the contributions today and I compliment my colleagues on them. When speaking on the legislation, it is important to be careful about our phraseology. It fits into the kind of week we are having in Dáil Éireann where partnership appears to be the theme. There is much talk about partnership and some union-bashing taking place. It will be interesting to see how the Private Members' debate on Irish Ferries proceeds and concludes tonight.I would like to acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, whose work I am always happy to applaud. He does a great job on our behalf. He gave me an excellent Dáil response last week, which I would like to acknowledge.I represent the constituency of Dublin South-West, which includes the major population centre of Tallaght. Since I first became involved in public life as a member of Dublin County Council in 1991, particularly over the past three years when I have had the honour of being a Dáil Deputy, the workload has changed and different issues have arisen. With other Dáil colleagues, I addressed a meeting in the National Library, organised by the Community Platform. While it touched on some of the issues relating to this Bill, it related generally to poverty and other issues of concern to many groups. I made the point that my nine weekly clinics have become a multicultural gathering. Issues now arise that did not arise three, five or ten years ago. Issues relating to this Bill are being brought to our attention, which is fair enough. It fascinates me that local people bring what I might describe as the "international community" to meet their local politicians. This indicates clear integration in these communities between local people and immigrants.I live in a parish where there are challenges related to foreign nationals seeking employment. I live in an estate which was founded in 1972, and my local junior school, St. Mark's in Springfield, has approximately 300 international children out of an enrolment of approximately 500. It is clear that communities such as Springfield and Tallaght have changed over the years, partly as a result of some of the issues we are discussing this evening.There are also issues relating to social welfare, whereby unemployment figures are increasing in communities when jobs are clearly available. This relates to the issue of work permits. The point was made that the Bill is another response to our skills and labour force needs,.A number of different organisations in my constituency, particularly in Tallaght, have raised issues with me. I have also been in receipt of representations, which have been copied to other colleagues, from the Migrant Rights Centre in Ireland which is based in Parnell Square. A group from that organisation contacted me some time ago because they were anxious to visit the Parliament. People from a number of different countries arrived that evening and I introduced them to other colleagues. These people raised concerns about work permits being issued for two years, workers employed under work permits being allowed to change jobs and giving migrant workers employed under both categories the right to family reunification. While I am aware that organisations are entitled to make known their point of view, I am merely putting it on the record. Organisations who go to the trouble of contacting Members of the Dáil are entitled to a voice. I expect the Minister and his officials are considering the various representations received from various groups, not just in our communities but from centrally-based organisations. I hope the Minister will respond in this regard.The Minister made the point that he had two key objectives in introducing the Employment Permits Bill. He is anxious to put in place a framework where he can implement and manage an economic migration policy, the details of which he confirmed in his speech. He also referred to providing a number of new and important protections for migrant workers. Migrant workers and their rights have been discussed over a long period. It is important to acknowledge that economic migration policy responded quickly to the improvement in the economic performance. This includes the reduction in unemployment and the resultant labour shortages.My community is the third largest population centre in the country. I often said that Tallaght had the population of a city but the status of a village. Now, however, not only have there been huge improvements as far as the provision of infrastructure, facilities and services is concerned, but people are working, which is important to acknowledge. Prominent Opposition spokespersons from almost all parties no longer refer to Ireland's economy being in poor shape but to great progress. I am aware there are challenges in this regard.Last week I met with visitors from Australia who had visited Dublin previously. They made the point that it has changed completely. They noticed a real change in many of the services available, including hotels, restaurants and fast food outlets. This is happening in every community throughout the country. It is right that the Minister should take account of these issues and challenges.The situation has changed even since the accession of the new European member states on 1 May 2004. There are real challenges as far as migrant workers are concerned. In fairness — I will be brave enough to say it — not everyone in the country is happy about this change. My colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has dealt with this important issue. After the legislation is passed, there will be challenges, and it will be interesting to see how the debate will continue. I do not believe the debate will end when the legislation is passed. There will always be issues and challenges.The involvement in our economic success of migrant workers has been acknowledged in the legislation; the Minister made this point when introducing the Bill. Opposition colleagues will make different points — they may dot the i's and cross the t's, which is fair enough. However, I hope the legislation will be seen in a positive light as a response to the situation as it develops. We must be responsible in how we respond, the language we use and our attitude to getting the message across to our communities. Every community faces debate, difficulties and challenges and it is important that we should be responsible and, in particular, that we should be careful in our choice of language.Last weekend I returned from the Ukraine as part of an Oireachtas delegation. It was an amazing experience and it was interesting to visit a country which also had a big brother neighbour to see how it is coping and developing. I tabled parliamentary questions this week on this and similar economies. Nowadays, Ireland has an amazing reputation abroad and the reaction of people when they realise one is from Ireland is interesting. It would not have happened years ago.Ireland has gained an amazing reputation following the success of social partnership. A number of colleagues have been critical of this process but I have been a strong supporter. I come from a working class background and I was a trade union activist for a long time, although I made a clear choice to join Fianna Fáil. The party has a proud record of promoting social partnership. The Taoiseach has been a strong advocate and this has been acknowledged by Opposition leaders. We should be proud of the progress made and I hope those who criticise social partnership understand we must be careful not to tear down the fabric of the system. We are entitled to raise issues and score political points but, at the end of the day, the abolition of social partnership would be chaotic for everybody, not least the workers the Minister is trying to protect in this legislation.The Bill provides that employment permits are granted to the employee and that the permit will outline rights and entitlements of the worker concerned. It prohibits recruitment related deductions from remuneration and the retention by the employer of the employee's personal documents. The legislation will also empower the Minister to formulate parameters within which an active economic migration policy may be pursued. This will be welcomed given that many Members have had to make representations on behalf of migrant workers who felt the need to speak out about their position. They will feel these new provisions are progressive. It is fair to put the emphasis on the worker rather than giving powers to employers to treat people as they wish.Section 13 deals with the governance of the numbers and employment types for which employment permits may be granted. This should be examined in the context of the development of our economy. The domestic workforce needs to be supplemented in a number of industries. Some people in our communities will always be critical of migrant workers and the international community and they will feel there should be another way. Constituents often say to public representatives that our first priority should be to look after the local workforce.I feel strongly about the future of social partnership and the need to support that process in every way. Much political debate involving both local and national politicians has centred on social partnership. While it is not under threat, people are having a go at it. Colleagues will raise this issue again later during Private Members' Business. While I am interested in the debate on Irish Ferries, I will also be interested in how the Tallaght players, Richard Dunne and Robbie Keane, are getting on with the national soccer team. I hope the Opposition will not seek many divisions so that we will be able to watch Ireland beat Switzerland.

It is absolutely vital that foreign workers should enjoy the same rights and protections as domestic workers. While not everybody will agree, people are entitled to object in a democracy. Many other issues will be raised and debated over the next 600 days before the next general election, despite what a number of people would like to think. I hope the House will be careful in dealing with the issues of migrant workers, international communities and asylum to ensure the debate will remain positive and responsible.It is important to acknowledge what has been done by the Minister and Ministers of State. I wish them well in this regard. This issue centres on protecting the economy, which has made tremendous progress. I will not upset my Opposition colleagues by suggesting things only started to happen when Fianna Fáil got back into power in 1987. I am not sure on a night of national fervour as we focus on Lansdowne Road that I should upset everybody. However, I am proud my participation as a member of Fianna Fáil and the work done by colleagues. I hope the Minister will put his head down to implement the legislation. It will require bravery in respect of a number of the provisions.I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to make my brief contribution tonight. I am always happy to be positive about my country, city and community. I look forward to supporting the Minister and his colleagues in ensuring the passage of the Employment Permits Bill.

Ceist mhór í atá ag déanamh tinnis do mórán daoine, ní amháin na daoine atá gafa leis na ceadúnais. Labhair an Teachta Arthur Morgan níos luaithe agus mar urlabhraí Shinn Féin ar cheart, comhionannas agus cearta daonna, ba mhaith liom gnéithe áirithe sa Bhille a ardú.Conas a bhuanaíonn an Bille seo na polasaithe cuimsitheacha inimirce ar bhonn cearta daonna? Ba chóir dúinn sin a dhéanamh ach níl aon fhianaise sa Bhille go bhfuil an straitéis sin ann.Teipeann ar an Bhille déileáil leis an cheist mhór, ceist na sclábhaíochta agus cé chomh leochaileach agus atá daoine atá sa staid sin. Cuireann sé in iúl cé chomh fimíneach is atá an Rialtas nár chuir sé aon fhorálacha sa Bhille a léireodh conas a dhéanfar oibrithe atá neamhchláraithe faoi láthair a chlárú agus a tharraingt isteach sa chóras mar a mhol muid an tseachtain seo caite d'Éireannaigh sna Stáit Aontaithe.There are a number of questions I would like to pose in addition to those already raised. How will this Bill fit with the proposed immigration and residents Bill, which is expected in late 2006? That should have been the first item with subsequent legislation amended accordingly.The Employment Permits Bill is inseparable from the broader immigration agenda of the Government and it is another example of the ad hoc, piecemeal approach the Government takes to immigration policy. Have the Minister and officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment actively engaged with the Minister and officials at the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform to ensure there is a coherent approach to immigration? I see no evidence of it so far. Will elements of this Bill become obsolete on foot of promised legislation, namely the immigration and residents Bill?Sinn Féin has repeatedly called for a well thought out, comprehensive immigration policy reform package. This would include the introduction of a positive immigration policy, underpinned by respect for human rights and a family-centred ethos appropriately reflecting an emphatic understanding gained through the experiences of our emigrants. This should recognise the significant potential contribution of migrants to our society.In contrast, the ad hoc approach to immigration displayed by the Government, in the form of knee jerk responses to a so-called crisis and the cosmetic reforms introduced in particular by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has resulted in a collage of policies with no common raison d'être. This approach seems to be filling gaps in the domestic labour market and the common function seems to be to reduce migrants to economic units. That is a pity as we still have an opportunity to address immigration in a positive, human rights centred manner.This Bill proposes to do no more than place existing policies on visas and work permits on a statutory footing. In stipulating the criteria to guide ministerial discretion it defines the public interest very narrowly, in terms of public order, national security, health and safety and the need to protect the labour market. It does not address fundamental issues that should be considered in determining the public interest, such as integration and family reunification. These would be required if it was a policy genuinely based on human rights.I am concerned by the Bill's failure to reverse the current scenario whereby migrant workers are bound to one employer. This increases their vulnerability to exploitation by unscrupulous employers. Simply posting a copy of the document to a migrant worker does nothing to change the situation of bonded labour.As a result the Bill will fail to impact in a positive manner on trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Last week the Joint Committee on European Affairs heard evidence of what is happening in Europe and here. While there is a lack of solid data on trafficking in Ireland, figures from European Parliament research indicate large numbers of women are trafficked from eastern to western Europe each year for the purpose of prostitution. The failure of this Bill to guarantee all migrant workers the right to change employer means these circumstances have not been addressed. This contributes to the vulnerability of women to sexual exploitation.The Government's failure to include measures that would offer undocumented workers routes to regularisation is hypocritical. In response to a question I raised last April the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, stated he would not consider an amnesty to regularise illegal workers. Last week a Minister promoted the introduction of a system to regularise undocumented workers in the United States. He espoused the benefits of such a scheme yet this Bill offers nothing to undocumented migrants here. This amounts to nothing short of hypocrisy.This Bill has been promoted in some quarters as a green card system but this is not the case. A green card system offers pathways to citizenship and long-term residency but this Bill offers neither. A green card system offers the holder the ability to change from one employer to another, in order to better oneself, improve one's quality of life and avoid bullying, abuse and slave labour. A proper green card system is one we should examine rather than exacerbating the current, flawed, pro-employer system. This Bill does not contribute to a comprehensive, coherent policy of immigration based on human rights. It does not significantly reduce the possibility for exploitation of migrant workers.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	386	In general, I welcome the introduction of this Bill. A number of its features are important to ensure that non-nationals working here are not used and abused as happened in the past. I have some reservations about matters not fully addressed in the Bill. I welcome the change in respect of work permits going directly to the worker concerned, with a copy sent to the employer. This will allow workers greater freedom and the ability to change employer provided they stay in the same line of work as the original work permit allows. There does not seem to be provision to change the nature of employment should that type of work no longer be required of if the employer ceases to trade.We are using people in a manner that suits our current needs, consigning them to their fate when we no longer need their skills. This is unfair and runs against any sense of natural justice. There is a need for flexibility on the possibility of changing the nature of work so that non-national workers can feel more secure in their new life here.I welcome the inclusion of the section whereby an employer cannot keep any personal documents such as a passport, documents regarding accounts in financial institutions, documents regarding skills and qualifications and travel documents of non-national workers. As we have seen in the past, this practice among some employers led to discrimination and the abuse of workers. To the best of my knowledge, however, there are many employers who have non-nationals working for them who are recruited by and working for agencies. Such employers contact the agencies to provide the worker and do not employ the non-national directly. My concern is that unless it is clearly stated in the Bill, some agencies may be in a position to retain such documents and abuse the worker involved. It must be clearly stated that nobody has the right to retain such documents belonging to any other person.I welcome the provision that workers are to be paid the minimum wage as it will work towards preventing abuses that occurred in the past. Once again, however, it does not go far enough to ensure the worker is treated fairly. There should be a provision included stating that the standard wage for the job should be paid to non-national workers. That will not please the employers who seek to take advantage of cheaper labour but out of a sense of natural justice it is only fair that non-nationals be paid the same rate as Irish people for the same work. After all, the job is being offered to non-nationals because an Irish or EU citizen has not taken up such an offer. In this instance, a non-national worker should have the same employment rights as an EU citizen and should be paid accordingly for similar work.The limited provisions contained in the Bill are long overdue and there is no reason the Government could not have introduced them a long time ago. Economists have been warning for years that a large number of skilled foreign workers are necessary for our future economic growth. If people were offered a fair wage for the work, it would stop situations arising such as the one Irish Ferries. We can avail of a non-national willing to come here to work but we should not boost our economy and standard of living at the expense of those people. If they are willing to help with the work, we should be willing to share the profits of their labour equally with them.In the event of a permit being denied, the appeal is carried out by an officer appointed by the Minister for that purpose. That is unfair as an appeal should be lodged with an independent body to allow for the people to have a fair hearing. That process must be changed and an independent body formed to handle such appeals.The Bill will go some way towards preventing the sort of abuse of foreign workers that has come to light in recent months. The provision of a green card system as a mechanism to recruit skilled workers is necessary. However, the Bill also raises some significant questions about the rights of the green card holder. If a green card holder believes he is being mistreated, for example, how should he proceed? Will he be able to seek alternative employment, spend a period of time unemployed or forced to leave the country? What about the amount workers must earn in a year? If they are to be paid the minimum wage they cannot earn a substantial amount. Where does that leave them?The Bill does nothing to clarify the confusion surrounding the rights of foreign workers to bring their families to Ireland. Does the Government have any appreciation of the hardship suffered by these workers being apart from their families? What would be our reaction if Irish workers in foreign countries were denied the right to bring their families with them?There is nothing in the Bill to help non-nationals to integrate into Irish society or to help Irish people to deal with different cultures and learn about inter-cultural living. Such provisions are necessary if we are to avoid inter-cultural conflict and stereotyping, which will lead to increased racism and be greatly detrimental to our society. The Bill needs to be improved greatly before it will have any beneficial effect on this society.There are hundreds of undocumented Irish in New York and throughout the United States. I appeal to this Government to do whatever it can to ensure those people get an amnesty. After all, we opened up our air space to allow the transit of American troops to the war in Iraq. The Americans should now give us back something in return and legalise our Irish emigrants. Anyone who has been in the US for more than five years deserves that. We should encourage our Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that happens.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	387	Last week, this House supplicated itself before the US Congress seeking the regularisation of the position of the undocumented Irish, and the House spoke with one voice on that issue. It is unfortunate that this Bill is the nearest we get to legislation that reflects the position of people entering this country under circumstances that need to be regularised because it appears to be far from what we would want for our own citizens in countries and economies like the United States. Calling the residency permit allowed for in this Bill, which is nothing like the US green card system, a green card is playing loose and fast with language and creating unrealistic expectations about this Government's immigration policy, never mind its employment policy.Forfás has submitted a report to the expert group on future skills needs and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The report is interesting in that it states something many of us have long believed but which needs to be put on the record and properly understood. Migration in terms of labour is good for the economy. Not only does it increase gross domestic product but it increases it to the extent that it is more or less neutral in terms of GDP  per capita. The level of wealth we have with our current population is maintained with those who come here to provide their employment skills and increase our economic needs.More importantly, migration in terms of labour is needed from the point of view of our dependency ratio. I refer to those who are in labour and those who depend on the fruits of that labour, including pensioners, young people and social services. Currently, we have a good dependency ratio in terms of other European countries but as we grow older as a country our indigenous population will not be able to sustain those standards and those employed in the Irish economic workforce will become less of a factor. It is unfortunate that we have not addressed those aims in this debate.It is particularly unfortunate that when we had an opportunity for debate on immigration issues the Government was not more firm in tackling misconceptions on the part of the wider public. The tawdry affair that was the constitutional referendum on citizenship failed to get across the point that most foreign nationals are here for legitimate reasons. Most of them are here because they are part of the existing work permits system and this Bill is a poor way of thanking those who have come here and helped in the economic benefit this country has received over the past ten years because many of the problems that continue to exist in terms of bonded labour that migrant workers find themselves in will be perpetuated by this Bill. Their work permit, to all intents and purposes, is owned by their employer and their freedom to move from one employment to the other is restricted.The social problems that many of these workers continue to experience in terms of family reunification remain unaddressed in this Bill. Unless the Government is willing, which I suspect it is not, to address these issues on Committee Stage, we are merely putting poor legislation on the Statute Book.I want to record other aspects of the Forfás report, particularly the overview that organisation has carried out of skills shortages in our economy by occupation. The report claims there are shortages in construction, including architects, civil engineers, planners and quantity surveyors. In the financial area there appears to be a current shortage of accountants and tax experts. I find that surprising but that is what the report states. In engineering the system is not providing enough people in terms of design and production engineers and there is a shortage of technicians. In information technology, there is a shortage of computer analysts and programmers. In pharmaceuticals, there is a shortage of chemical engineers. In the health care area and across a range of areas we appear to have shortages, including in transport, sales and catering. Across a panoply of our economy we are likely to experience skills shortages in the coming years and unless we have a migration and an employment policy that is more proactive than the Government is prepared to put forward, we are lining ourselves up for serious economic difficulties in the future, because the Government continues to ignore the social consequences of failing to have an integrated policy in this area.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill because it allows us to discuss migration and related problems here. Last week we had a frank and wide ranging, although too short, discussion on a similar policy in America. There seems to be unanimity in this House regarding the approach in America and this Bill has generally received a favourable response.As party spokesperson on tourism I come into daily contact with many employers who are forced to employ non-nationals. Most of those working in Dublin as receptionists, porters or kitchen staff are non-nationals. Many come from EU member states and are entitled to be here but there is a demand to bring in more people from outside the European Union and this causes the problem.There are many low-skilled jobs in tourism, such as cleaning and housekeeping. At times employers have difficulty finding Irish people to do this type of work. That is why they need a labour supply. This type of worker was exploited in the past. Under this Bill, however, the employee will have a permit which will ensure that type of exploitation does not happen in the future. Legislation for migrant workers must be firm and clear but also protect them. This is the first such Bill but probably not the last because more people will want to come to Ireland and will be needed here.This Bill allows for a wide-ranging discussion. Two or three years ago visitors from America who came to Dublin expecting the usual céad míle fáilte and to hear an Irish accent at the hotel reception met people who were not Irish. While they did not object to that they could not get information or directions because these people knew neither the geography of, nor the events in, the city.There should be a four or five week induction programme for people who come to work here. This might ensure that they understand the ethos of Irish tourism, namely, that visitors expect a friendly welcome whether from an Irish person or another. These workers should realise that and have the skills to provide that welcome. FÁS runs such courses but few are exposed to them. When I ask non-nationals working in hotels did they attend the FÁS course, few have even heard of it. The Minister of State might refer to that point in his reply to this debate.There seems to be no structured language courses for migrant workers who do not speak English. This evening a person who is offering a language course for Polish people called me wanting to know if there were other people in the area to make the course viable, and there are. The VEC system could run English courses for migrant workers and others who come into the country. According to a recent survey in America, people there do not mind immigrants coming to their country who are willing to work and pay tax, as long as they learn to speak English. The same should apply here if people want to come to work and pay their taxes they should learn English and have the opportunity to do so. As part of our migrant policy we should set up a network of language classes for the immigrants, whose numbers are increasing.We received a helpful document from the Immigration Council of Ireland showing that over the past ten years many migrant workers have come here, and between April 2004 and April 2005, almost 70,000 came. That is the highest figure since the Central Statistics Office series of annual migration estimates began. We will continue to face this problem because of the skill shortages here and the greater demand for immigrant workers.I have met people who were exploited and am glad that the employee will now have more rights and be better protected as a result of this Bill. It is important that migrant workers be made aware of their rights when they come here. They should be made aware they can change employment here and not feel intimidated.They should also have someone to whom they can complain. The labour inspectorate will be increased from 20 to 31 but that is a small number to carry out inspections across the country and ensure compliance with employment rights legislation. Those I met who were exploited, forced to leave the country and a few who felt terrorised were unaware of their rights, enforcement, or to whom they could complain. The provision of such information should be included in this legislation. From what the Minister has said and from having a cursory look at the Bill, I presume that when they get their work permits, all their rights will be included and attached. All the contact numbers that they need should be given. That is very important.Regarding categories of workers, we are dependent on what Forfás sets out as our skill needs. At different times, different industries and parts of the country will need relevant skilled workers. Farming is becoming more dependent on technology and computerisation now plays a major role in it. Recently, however, an application for a permit for someone from Brazil was refused. I was asked to look into the matter and was told that it was a category of worker that can be sourced within the EU. That was not true, since the employer had tried and a person could not be found. The application was refused and is now no longer even being considered. As we know, since the country is stealing many of our markets in the beef industry, Brazil is becoming very progressive in agriculture. It is no accident and not simply because it can produce beef more cheaply. It is developing a highly technical type of farming, and we have much to learn from it.Many people are also leaving the land, and some farmers find it difficult to find labour, even from Farm Relief. They therefore need experts at different levels. They need farm labourers, whom they can probably get within the country and certainly within the EU, but they also need others. In this instance, the Brazilians could have supplied that expertise. Unfortunately, the farmer in question was unable to bring them in. I know that it may not be possible for the Minister to reply on this aspect of employment permits but it certainly deserves his consideration.Pillar two of the employment permits system is something with which I certainly agree, namely, the intra-company transfer scheme. Some companies in this country could do with some new thinking. Many managers have been there since the late 1980s or early 1990s and are suffering from fatigue and burn-out. The Celtic tiger was really spawned by the distress of the Irish worker at every level. Management in this country played a very important role in it, and this transfer scheme is very important, since it could bring much-needed expertise to the country. People like to travel and bring their families with them or wait until they have grown up. Some managers at very high levels of industry in companies around the world are single. We must attract such people to the country, and perhaps some of them might stay if they like it here. That certainly provides an opportunity, not only for employees but for the country itself.Recently we have experienced a lack of scientists. We should try to attract back our own scientists who are all over the world. There has been a major drain to America, an area where one will not hear anyone from Ireland or Europe complaining. The Americans will attract scientists or people who have done valuable research. I recently saw an article in Time that discussed the brain drain from Europe. The USA has a definite policy of paying such scientists very well to attract them from Europe to conduct research in Silicon Valley and a similar area in Pennsylvania. They are trying to take people at that level, whereas we are losing them. We do not seem to have any policy to attract them back into this country. We should have one and we should also try to attract postdoctoral researchers to Ireland.Overall, I certainly welcome this Bill. It is an attempt to produce a totally new policy and give order to existing practice, making it fair and safe for people to come and work in Ireland and to stop the exploitation of which we have heard so many examples. I can see that in this House we will be discussing immigration, emigration and employment permits again within two or three years, since they will very much become part of this country.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I welcome this evening's opportunity to speak on this Bill, the provisions of which are further evidence of the inadequate approach that the Government is taking to people who wish to work here and contribute to the Irish economy and Irish life. A proactive approach to immigration is required instead of the cautious one taken in this Bill.The Government parties have failed to attach due importance to the economic role of migrant workers here in Ireland. They are now a crucial part of the economy, paying taxes, doing essential work and contributing to the dynamics of a modern society. In my constituency and county, we see their Trojan work in building many of the walls. They do a tremendous job, and I also know that many farmers who employ such migrant workers are very happy with their work, finding them very skilful, co-operative, dedicated and hard-working.It is well documented that Ireland has traditionally been a country of emigration rather than immigration. The last ten years have seen a reversal of that phenomenon, with Ireland now experiencing net immigration.I look forward to continuing the debate tomorrow morning.

He will particularly emphasise the support which many of us wish to express. It is important to acknowledge that the opportunity to discuss this important issue arises from the initiative of the Independent Deputies who have placed this motion on the agenda. I compliment them in this regard.As in my political work in general, I bring my own experiences to this debate. I am aware of what is sometimes said about Fianna Fáil Deputies in the context of such debates, but I remind Members that I have a trade union background. I have never worked at sea but my paternal grandfather died working on the sea. For this reason, I have always had a particular interest in issues relating to the rights of seafaring workers. My grandfather was at sea at a time when workers were not as well looked after and that cost him his life. I have a great deal of sympathy in regard to the matter under discussion.It is important that we should express solidarity with the Irish Ferries workers. There has been much political debate on this issue and some Opposition Members have made colourful contributions. That is fair enough in the rough and tumble of politics. I listened carefully to last night's debate, particularly the contributions of the Ministers of State, Deputies Killeen and Gallagher. I compliment both in expressing the general view of Fianna Fáil Members that we are strongly in favour of supporting the Irish Ferries workers. There has been much talk, both inside and outside the House, in the last number of days on the question of social partnership. This issue was discussed at a Community Platform meeting I attended today in the National Library.I appreciate that colleagues have different views on the partnership process. I have been a strong supporter of it throughout my community life and am proud of what the Government has achieved in this regard. During leaders' questions on 28 September, I was pleased to hear the Taoiseach's forthright comments which were strongly supportive of the Irish Ferries workers and critical of the company. Despite what might be said in the cut and thrust of political debate, the Taoiseach did not spare Irish Ferries and it is time for other organisations and individuals to provide some answers. There has been some criticism of how IBEC has responded to this issue, for example, but I do not propose to speak on behalf of that body.I ask that Members behave responsibly during this debate. I had hoped to be in Lansdowne Road tonight or to at least watch the performance of the Tallaght players Robbie Keane and Richard Dunne on television. Instead, I will listen to this important debate. The Government understands the sensitivities of the situation and is supportive of the workers. I look forward to the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, in this regard.

I regret the decision of Irish Ferries to make 543 of its seafarers redundant or to retain them under reduced pay and conditions. This is distressing for the workers and their families. I also note that SIPTU, the Seamen's Union of Ireland and the company are in talks under the auspices of the Labour Court. All Members must be careful to say nothing that might prejudice those discussions. The debate on the Irish Ferries situation illustrates that as a small island nation, situations such as this can affect us severely and that we are vulnerable to issues of international trade. We should be much more conscious of this when discussing issues in this House, whether it be the question of foreign direct investment or so forth.When our colleague, Deputy Hogan, spoke on this issue last night, he was particularly negative in respect of many aspects of Government policy. He said "People have heard me regularly in this House listing all the stealth taxes and charges so I will not bore the House with them". Nevertheless, he went on to list them all, including VAT, vehicle registration tax and so on.

It included hand-written notes. I know some Members do not believe it. The point I wish to make is not related to the fact that I have a transcript of last night's debate. The point is that even when one combines income tax and all indirect taxes, Ireland is one of the lowest tax regimes in Europe. This is a fact whether Members like it or not. Opposition Members can claim somebody in the press office wrote this speech for me. However, I ask Members to do the sums and they will reach the same conclusion that Ireland is a low tax regime. They may not want to admit that is the case.

There is no moral justification whatsoever for the action it took. It was driven purely by the profit motive and it is not in the interests of business generally that companies of the size and stature of the Irish Continental Group should go forward on the basis of profit only. There is a social and a community responsibility on the part of all major companies in a country such as Ireland. It is because the people of Ireland have worked so hard in the past that the companies in Ireland are making such good profits. To take this action against its staff is unacceptable.I am delighted Irish Ferries has finally, against the head, gone into the industrial relations machinery and, hopefully, whatever action comes at the end of the day will be agreed by all the social partners involved and, particularly, will be to the advantage of the staff of Irish Ferries.

This is an internationally accepted maritime law and practice. Every ship, whether a ferry or cargo ship, that travels in Europe could have a flag of Panama or Liberia. There are questions to be asked and there are discussions that need to take place at a European level as to what flag can be used on ships that operate in Europe and out of Europe.We must take into account also the fact that Ireland is a peripheral State that depends on the ro-ro on cargo ships and on ferry ships to get our cargo and trade to the continent and further afield. Bearing in mind the strategic importance of shipping, its employment tradition and the history built up in recent years in regard to minimum wages and other good conditions of employment, we should take positive action in Europe to bring about standards on the sea that are acceptable in Ireland also.In recent years the Government has made huge strides in developing the maritime industry in Ireland, particularly with the maritime development organisation which has looked upon Irish shipping as being of huge strategic importance. There is room for development and enlargement of the shipping services in Ireland. There is room for more Irish people to develop seafaring as a career.The Government has put in place financial incentives for Irish and other seafaring companies to register their boats in Ireland, including the refund of employers' PRSI, an income tax allowance for seafarers working at sea for over 161 days a year and the flat rate tonnage tax. These are all attractions for companies to register their boats in Ireland. However, there is also the question of wages which must be examined at European level to ensure that the ships that operate around Europe, and particularly from Ireland, are operated at wage levels comparable to the wage levels that pertain in all of the developed western European countries.

Deputy Howlin and I have met Irish Ferries and members of the seafaring industry regularly in recent years. I do not need to stress the importance of Irish Ferries to Wexford and the importance of what Irish Ferries is attempting to do.The Taoiseach's recent contribution in the Dáil left us in no doubt as to how the Government views the approach of Irish Ferries, which is to be regretted. There are implications for the whole of the social partnership on which the success of the last decade has been founded. Whether, as the Taoiseach pointed out, the offer from Irish Ferries can be viewed as redundancy is a question that is open to debate. The Attorney General has indicated that even though no application has as yet been made to the Department and he cannot rule on it until such an application is made he has grave concerns. It appears to me that if one offers a redundancy on a take it-or accept deteriorating employment conditions, that is not redundancy.The conflict is between a company trying to enhance profits and a union trying to protect the rights of workers who have contributed in no small measure to serious profits for Irish Ferries. At long last Irish Ferries may have seen some light since it has agreed to talk. All conflicts can only be resolved by meaningful dialogue and engagement where people are prepared to listen to the other point of view. It is a tragedy that in this case Irish Ferries has taken too long to listen to what its workers are saying. Workers may well be forced to accept what is called redundancy through fear.The difficulty for a Government is that it cannot introduce legislation willy-nilly without reference to the European Union. While it might be appropriate to say that a foreign company using our ports would have to accept Irish labour law the converse would be that an Irish ship entering another port might have to accept the labour laws of that port. That is the difficulty. The Ministers involved will do their best to introduce some kind of legislation the result of which should be that the seafaring industry is not decimated.The maritime college in Cork has been set up at tremendous expense to the taxpayer. If the few professionals who are training there to take out their various tickets cannot be ensured employment within our national industry it would be an unmitigated disaster.I have no problem with non-nationals working in Ireland provided they work under Irish contracts and are treated with the respect which Members of all parties and Independent Members have earned for workers in the past. That is kernel of this matter. We cannot return to Dickensian days and tell workers that they did not contribute. Neither can we ignore the contribution seafarers have made. The shipping industry would be under threat if the Irish Ferries company was not prepared to note and accept the workers' contribution. The cost to us as taxpayers could be in the region of €12 million if redundancies occur. I, for one, hope it will be ruled that it is not a redundancy situation. The cost to the company is significant also. The profits it hopes to enhance could be considerably reduced by the cost of the redundancy package, if it is implemented.The motion by the Independent group of Deputies has focused the House on this matter and I am glad we can be ad idem on it. It is time Irish Ferries considered national and local interests apart from profits.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I welcome this motion and commend my Independent colleagues for having tabled it. It is straight, direct and appropriate to the extraordinary situation we are facing. As my constituency colleague Deputy Tony Dempsey said, those of us in Wexford have a long history of understanding Irish Ferries. The company was once highly respected, offering employment in my constituency and elsewhere and providing a vital service to the State. Unfortunately, the company's recent history is less glorious. In recent times, we have seen the debacle of a Filipina woman who was offered €1 an hour to work as a hairdresser on one of the company's vessels. That woman was treated deplorably. Another woman working on another ferry owned by the company was treated in a similar fashion, but even up to today she has not been offered adequate compensation.The pattern has emerged of a company that was once reputable and glorious but which has now become a disreputable, maverick operator in the Irish employment sphere. We have had the experience of the MV Normandy whose workers were given notice while on board the ship. The personnel director of Irish Ferries flew to France and boarded the ship to give out redundancy notices to individual workers with an instruction that he wanted to collect them before the ship docked. Virtually no opportunity was given to people to consider their position or discuss it with their trade union representatives. It is not the way we do business in this State where our labour law has been developed and refined over decades to bring about the industrial peace we have enjoyed along with the prosperity that has flowed from it.Employers, unions and elected representatives must stand firm and not allow any maverick outfit to pull down the edifice of social partnership that has been painstakingly put together by so many people for so long.At the time of the MV Normandy fiasco, bad and all as it was, promises were given that it would not have any implications for the Irish Sea routes because it was unique to the French ferry. I am afraid, however, that the promise did not last cracking time. There are clear knock-on consequences now, one of which is the demise in recent weeks of Rosslare Ship Repairs, a company that employed workers to maintain the MV Normandy. Apparently, east European workers are able to do everything on the MV Normandy, including crewing the vessel, acting as stewards and doing maintenance. There are issues for us to address on that matter.These new proposals, however, go well beyond that assault. They are nothing less than an outright attack on social partnership. Social partnership is a two-way process. It has given benefits to everyone, including workers, employers and society at large. The attitude of the employers' organisation, IBEC, is inexplicable therefore. Has IBEC decided to abandon social partnership? It is hard to read any other conclusion into IBEC's statements on the matter. One commentator likened this outrageous move to the outsourcing of workers to third countries but that is an unfair comparison. This situation involves the removal of Irish jobs which are being replaced — because the company has a loophole through which to do it — by people who are paid a fraction of Irish workers' wages, but who take the positions because they are vulnerable and any job is welcome.The role and attitude of the Government must be examined in this affair. I have sat through this debate from the start, unlike many Members who have flitted in to make comments. We have seen the attitude of the Taoiseach who is the so-called architect of partnership. He was initially aghast but he is not mindful to do anything. The Government amendment is weak and unacceptable. It notes "with concern the initial reluctance of Irish Ferries to engage", but do we have any evidence of an engagement now, beyond peripheral engagement? The Government motion calls on Irish Ferries to "reconsider", but that is not the sort of robust reply from somebody who is supposed to be the defender — or, if one was to believe him, the creator — of social partnership.The entire response encapsulated in the Government amendment is inadequate and vacuous. The comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, last night were even worse. Presumably with the notion of trying to be objective, he stated "It should not be forgotten that there are two sides to this dispute... I am aware of the commercial pressures on all shipping companies to reduce their costs and streamline their operations", as if this was a streamlining process rather than something unprecedented in Irish industrial relations. The Minister of State went on to say, "It is not for me to seek to determine an independent shipping company's business strategy". In this instance, however, it is up to the Government to have a view on the outright destruction of Irish jobs and their replacement with vulnerable workers at a fraction of the cost, that is entirely out of kilter with Irish labour law and negotiated wage rates here.It is time for the Government and the House to be clear and unambiguous. Either we stand with a partnership arrangement or we do not. If we do not that is the end of partnership, but if we do we must act clearly and decisively to protect it. What has Ireland's attitude been to this issue? What is Ireland's attitude to the draft EU directive that would have maintained a proper regime of labour law for ferries operating between EU ports? It is quite clear from the Minister of State's contribution in the House last night that we were against the directive and were part of the cabal that brought it down. The most positive thing the Minister of State could say about the draft directive that would have given these workers rights, was that he was in favour of a study. For good measure, he is still in favour of a study even at this 11th hour. In my judgment, that is hopeless, totally inadequate and disgraceful. Will the Minister enact legislation in advance of the EU directive? He says the directive can be revamped, so it is time we did that. There are precedents for EU directives to be legislated for in advance of the directive becoming mandatory. If we are serious about this issue, if the Taoiseach's tears are not to be crocodile tears and if his utterances are to be seen as anything more than mere rhetoric, we must legislate now. I demand clarity of action from the Government that goes beyond wishes, hopes and exhortations. Are we to make it clear to Irish Ferries and any other maverick employer watching this development that we will not allow this destruction of Irish jobs, this erosion of decades of progress for Irish workers and this edifice of social partnership which has been so positive for the economy to be destroyed? Will we make it legislatively impossible for those who would destroy social partnership to get away with it or will we sit on our hands, shed crocodile tears and do nothing? Tonight we want to hear from the Government exactly what it will do.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	427	The bullyboy style ultimatum that Irish Ferries workers face represents a new low for Irish companies and the tactics Irish Ferries used to coerce people into taking so-called redundancy within a desperate two-week timeframe even though they had dedicated more than 30 years of their lives to the company is a shocking ploy undertaken by what was once a decent company. The behaviour of Irish Ferries throughout this episode has been totally reprehensible including its repeated shunning of one of the most respected industrial relations institutions, the Labour Court, until it thought it had secured sufficient acceptances of redundancy to make any Labour Court ruling obsolete.The treatment of Irish Ferries workers who carry out a tough and essential job for the nation in difficult circumstances, often requiring them to be away from their families for extended periods and working in stormy conditions has been utterly shameful. Many of the workers have been with the company for decades and were forced into an impossible and agonising position by the company. Workers not accepting the package could have been left with nothing to show for years of service and little hope of gaining other employment in the maritime sector for which they had been trained and to which they had dedicated most of their lives. Constituents I represent were left in this totally hopeless position agonising desperately over whether to take the deal even though they were implacably opposed to the plan by Irish Ferries to discard them and their colleagues on to the scrap heap and yellow-pack Irish maritime jobs forever. The two-week deadline imposed on Irish Ferries workers to accept the deal or receive no redundancy payment was callous and despicable in the extreme.We have heard no business case for the road down which Irish Ferries has taken our economy. Mr. Rothwell has not made the remotest case for it. Why can Stena Lines with 60% of market share continue to operate with relatively decent pay and conditions for its staff? When the record of Mr. Rothwell's management of Irish Ferries is considered it will be clear that his ineptitude has contributed most to the need for Irish Ferries to cut costs. For example, why did he decide to purchase the London travel agency, Tara, for €6 million — an operation that has since collapsed. Even more serious was the way he dramatically boosted the capacity of the parent company, Irish Continental Group, and bought the massive MV Ulysses while the MV Inisfree was still in operation. He ended MV Ulysses up in dry dock for 15 months while he failed to find a buyer for the MV Inisfree.When Mr. Rothwell's record is analysed in a clinical way we see error of judgment after error of judgment. While all this was going on and workers desperately tried to cut back and provide compliance with what he required in recent years, the level of Mr. Rothwell's pay continued to escalate even in the light of his own serious management mishaps. Mr. Rothwell got a €374,000 bonus leaving his overall remuneration package at approximately €687,000 for the year or €14,617 per week when the profits of ICG dropped by 17% in 2003. He also has shares in the company worth approximately €19.8 million. While Sparks and King were carrying out their analysis and before they reported we learnt that Mr. Rothwell placed advertisements in the press in Eastern Europe seeking workers approximately ten days before the report was due to be published.ICG earned a profit of more than €26 million last year and yet one worker, working as a beautician on the MV Inisfree ended up being paid €1 per hour working a 12-hour day seven days per week. How can such regimes be justified against the background of a successful company. During the week it was noticeable that the usual hyenas in the right wing newspapers ranted and raved about the great rottweiler and how we had a new Michael O’Leary on the Irish Sea. While I have no time for the rotten tactics employed by Mr. O’Leary in refusing trade union recognition, when the track records of Mr. O’Leary and that of the so-called rottweiler are considered, the rottweiler is no Michael O’Leary in terms of entrepreneurial flair. On inspection he turns out to be grossly incompetent.I salute the efforts of our SIPTU colleagues, in particular Mr. Tony Ayton and the ICF international union on the great battle they fought over many years. The latest episode with Irish Ferries has brought a despicable situation to a head. SIPTU has been battling continually against the disgraceful pay and conditions for workers on the Cork to Swansea route where the law of the jungle is allowed to prevail on the open seas and all efforts of the union have been defeated. We have seen the agony suffered by the workers on the MV Normandy and now we are faced with the devastation of the remaining three Irish Ferries ships in terms of an Irish workforce. Throughout this time our Maritime Development Agency and the National Maritime College are educating people to be mariners. As an island nation we need to get out there and look after our trade and passenger traffic on the sea. At the same time we have this yahoo in Irish Ferries seeking to destroy totally what has been achieved by the Government in this regard.Deputy Howlin referred to the EU ferry directive, which was discussed lugubriously around the European Commission from 1998 to 2004. When we consider the record of those who represented us at those negotiations, Senator O'Rourke, as Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy Woods, as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Jacob, as Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, it is clear that throughout that time Ireland was not on the side of those who wanted to bring about a lawful behaviour in the ferry industry, whereby the pay and conditions of all ferry workers would need to adhere to the minimum standards of whichever port they came from or went to. It is clear the Irish Government played a despicable role in defeating the efforts to introduce a ferries directive.Last week I had an interesting discussion in Liberty Hall with Mr. Norrie McVicker, a senior Scottish trade union official. He told me about the licensing system the Scottish Executive has introduced into its ferry industry covering routes between the Scottish islands and its mainland. A great hypocrisy in Irish Ferries is that while it attempted to devastate and sack its own workforce it applied for a licence to allow it to ply its trade on one of the Scottish routes.What about the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea regarding the flagging of vessels, which states that there must be a genuine link between the state and the ship.As usual the Taoiseach has behaved in an outrageous manner in this regard. He stated here that what was happening with Irish Ferries was sharp practice. Why did he not he put his money where his mouth is and introduce emergency legislation to provide a licensing system to adhere to the international convention to bring about a regime such as the European ferries directive? This would have ensured that Irish workers would have decent pay and conditions. This is still the challenge facing the country. As Deputy Howlin said, if we want to continue with social partnership, workers and their representatives must be treated as part of that partnership.Ultimately it must be remembered that Irish Ferries has received substantial supports from the State. Tonnage tax was introduced primarily to help the company and a number of other carriers on the Irish Sea and it benefited substantially when it was in difficult days in 2002 and 2003 from the operation of tonnage tax. It is obvious that in other areas of accelerated depreciation allowances and taxation matters, Irish Ferries was pushing an open door in terms of support.I salute the courage of the trade union movement, in particular SIPTU president Jack O'Connor, the head of ICTU, David Begg, Mr. Tony Ayton and Mr. Paul Smith, all of whom have highlighted the dreadful conditions which have applied to maritime workers where they have been yellow-packed, so to speak. On this matter they have drawn a line in the sand. They have rightly told the Taoiseach and the Government that this is a litmus test and that they will not accept outrageous, disgraceful bullyboy tactics used against 600 decent Irish male and female workers. That is not acceptable to this House or to the people. It comes close to being a form of criminal behaviour and must be dealt with by legislation.The Taoiseach must make a choice. If he wants to have some sort of social partnership for the future, a partnership which has underpinned many of the developments of this country, he must put in place the necessary legislation. A few weeks ago we passed a Bill within an hour when it was necessary to safeguard State property. We are now talking of the people of our State who decent, fine, brave workers. We can also pass a Bill next Tuesday and tell Mr. Rothwell he can adhere to Irish labour law and Irish pay.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I wish to share time with Deputies Sargent and Boyle.Are we to stand idly by as slave ships dock in Irish ports, twiddling our thumbs on the quays of Rosslare and Dublin Port as young, foreign, vulnerable workers slave 12 hours daily, seven days a week, on board ferries operating on the Irish Sea and on the routes between Ireland and France? The Government is standing idly by. Tough talking from the Taoiseach is worthless if neither he nor any of his Cabinet colleagues are willing to take action. It will mean nothing to workers like the Latvian crew member on the Irish Ferries ship, the MV Normandy, Ms Oksana Karamjana, who had the courage to speak out on “Prime Time” about her three-month contract working seven days a week for 12 hours per day with no holidays and no days off.There will be no change where there is no will to change. There have been many times in history when people could have stood back and made excuses. Slavery would not have been abolished. Child labour would persist in Ireland and Europe, Universal suffrage would be but a pipe dream. However, some people had the courage, will and sense of social justice to change those things for the better, to fight for what was right and to make the case for those less able to make it for themselves. They had a sense of justice that this Government clearly does not have.The members of this Government who shrug their shoulders in the face of the ongoing march of worker exploitation clearly have no empathy with the exploited workers. The Government amendment to the motion before the House tonight includes a line calling on Irish Ferries "to reconsider its proposal to outsource employment on its Irish Sea routes and to examine alternative viability options for these routes". Is that the totality of the Government response? Are we to bow to the will of parasites such as the chief executive of Irish Ferries, Eamonn Rothwell, who creams off in one hour what it will take the new agency workers two and a half weeks to earn?

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	430	Irish Ferries is a profitable company which is able to pay its chief executive an excessively high salary. The company has chosen to reject an independent Sparks and King consultants report on this matter and is trying only to cut costs.I ask again when it became acceptable for employers to cut costs by exploiting workers. Irish Ferries has approached this matter in a bullying manner, threatening that the company will offer only statutory redundancy and will exit the Irish Sea routes altogether if its proposals are not accepted within the limited timeframe it has set.Allowing Irish Ferries to proceed with this plan would be this State's most regressive act in respect of workers' rights. For many workers at Irish Ferries, the deal being presented by management leaves them with no option. Who would seriously expect them to take massive cuts in pay and accept the shredding of their terms and conditions to remain with the company? These workers are being pushed out.Unlike this Government, Sinn Féin is committed to defending and extending workers' rights and to bringing about an improvement in the living and working conditions of all workers. There are solutions to this problem, and it is inexplicable that the Government is not even attempting to pursue them. Last week in this House, my party tabled a motion which denounced the exploitation of workers on board ferries operating under flags of convenience out of Irish and EU ports. It noted that the draft ferries directive was withdrawn in August 2004 following the failure to reach a final agreement at the Council of Ministers. The Sinn Féin motion sought to get unanimous Dáil support for a demand that the European Commission urgently introduce a European ferries directive to combat social dumping on ferries and set minimum labour standards to ensure an end to the exploitation of workers on intra-EU passenger and ferry services.I understand from the comments made last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, that the Government has no intention of pressing the European Commission to bring forward such a directive. His comments clearly illustrate that the Government is willing to trample all over vulnerable workers on the premise that it would be uncompetitive for ferries to operate with proper pay and conditions for workers. If it is uncompetitive for them to pay their workers properly, let them go out of business and we can then establish a State ferry company to serve the people of Ireland and the needs of business.What is being done in respect of the possibility of introducing a licensing regime for ferries operating out of Irish ports? This is a system that has been employed in other jurisdictions. On the basis of what Deputy Gallagher said in his contribution to this debate last night, I am not sure he understands the import of what is on the way at Irish Ferries. He said it was not for him to seek to determine an independent company's business strategy.This attitude is the crux of the problem. The Government cannot be a disinterested bystander. It must be prepared at all times to intervene to protect the interests of the disadvantaged and marginalised, in this case the interests of workers who are to be subject to the reprehensible working conditions that Irish Ferries wishes to impose. The Government also has a role to play in preventing the displacement of workers covered by employment agreements. I challenge the Government to abandon its laissez-faire attitude, to have a sense of social justice and approach this issue with the will to resolve the situation and ensure no worker on board any ferry operating out of an Irish port is subjected to exploitative working conditions. I urge the full support of the motion and urge that the Government amendment be rejected.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Morgan as a chuid ama a roinnt agus leis na Teachtaí Neamhspleácha agus an Páirtí Sóisialach as an rún seo a chur os ár gcomhair. Tugann an Comhaontas Glas tacaíocht 100% dó.This is a very important motion because the issue involves the livelihoods of some 600 workers, with those of many others perhaps depending on the outcome at Irish Ferries. It is also a precedent. If ever there were proof that this Government is intent on taking a  laissez faire deregulation road, this is it. Its response has basically been to wag the finger and ask people to do the decent thing, but no more. Looking closely at the situation, one sees that not only is the Government refusing to take any decisive action it is also adopting the semblance of an agency rather than a government, doing the bidding of others and operating behind closed doors. It would be interesting to read the text of the discussion that took place at the European Council of Ministers and know the positions of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Ministers in regard to the European ferries directive. As we do not have that information, we must conclude we are dealing not with a Government but with a secret agency that is not prepared to divulge to the people what was said behind closed doors.We now have the outcome of that. Not only is there a risk to social partnership, which will have repercussions beyond Irish Ferries, but there is also a risk to the viability of our island economy. We must have dependable maritime routes and a shipping service. If we are dependent on transient workers who are working for a period to send money home, we are depending on people who are more easily disposed of by the more ruthless management structures we have seen come into being. Given that in bad weather shipping cannot travel and over the Christmas period double pay might be too much for the management, we are facing a hit and miss type of service. Approximately 80% of our trade is by sea so it is nothing short of national sabotage that is being condoned by the Government. It must act accordingly, given the gravity of what we face.French workers stopped the MV Normandy coming into Cherbourg last summer on a couple of occasions due to complaints about low wage regimes. That is a sign of what is facing this Government and it must take responsibility for giving rise to that possibility by being so lax in its response. Most of the staff in Irish Ferries are despondent at the prospect of a Government response. That is unacceptable. In some cases, the workers have such short service that their redundancy pay is nothing short of insulting. The Government should take account of that because there will be a huge backlash from people in general if they believe the Government is allowing Irish workers to be thrown on the sacrificial altar of the unregulated free market.The Minister must be aware that the flag of convenience is designed to give ship owners freedom from regulation. It is designed to lower health and safety regulations and to be more reckless with regard to environmental obligations, such as the discharge of oil. Ultimately, this situation is in nobody's interest. The Minister must take account of the huge ramifications of simply saying this is wrong but doing nothing about it.In Germany, there were attempts to introduce a low wages regime, similar to the one under discussion in this debate. However, the underwriters have prevented it. If a ship is registered in Bremen, it must employ German officers and crew to an extent that will ensure there is an indigenous balance in the workforce. That has resulted in a higher standard of shipping. The underwriters have insisted, because their money is on the line, that they will not accept this race to the bottom type of approach.If the Minister is serious about doing something about Irish Ferries, he should take that precedent on board. He should contact the underwriters of Irish Ferries and ensure that they, who have a commercial interest in this, are not hoodwinked into accepting a situation where there are lower health and safety and environmental obligations. That is something decisive the Minister could do within the law rather than having to run for cover. As happened in the German case, that would result in definite changes and regulations which are badly needed. I urge the Minister to take action.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	432	My father, along with his many other roles in life, was a merchant seaman. The job gave him a sense of fulfilment and much satisfaction. The skills he had were being properly utilised. However, the job had some social costs in that it meant long absences from the family. Eventually he decided on an onshore career. While the comparison is not directly applicable with the ferry workers who work on short haul routes, the skill of seamanship is one that is acquired through experience. The idea that experience can be replaced with a click of one's fingers, that flags of convenience can be replaced and that standards applicable in international law go by the wayside because of the economic convenience of owners is something this Parliament should not support.As an island nation, we should strive for the highest standards in international maritime law. That includes labour standards for those who work in this industry. People who are caught up in the current situation will find the words of the Taoiseach and the Government mealy mouthed. They have experience of previous situations. They remember what happened with B&I Line and Irish Shipping. They have no confidence in the Government, nor should they have given their experience of the attitude of previous Governments towards this industry.However, the Irish Ferries situation is different. It has appealed to the public sense of outrage more than the other conflicts in this industry. The fact that this proposal, if it can be dignified by the name, is being made after the situation that occurred with the MV Normandy and the employment circumstances of the Filipina woman, whose name I cannot remember, shows this company will go to any lengths to achieve what it wants in terms of underwriting the bottom line. Everyone is expendable except those at the top. We seem to take pride in the constant mentions in The Economist that this is the most globalised nation in the world but the reality of that globalisation is staring at us with the experience of the Irish Ferries workers.If the Government has any sense of embarrassment by what is happening, it should put in place the necessary legislation to ensure that this cannot recur. At the same time, it should seek to underwrite the situation by protecting the jobs that are in place and insisting on appropriate standards. If it is not prepared to do that, its words carry no more weight than the words of previous Governments with regard to the previous issues I mentioned.Hundreds of people are affected, including the additional jobs in the ferry ports. I represent a constituency that has a ferry port. This will have a cumulative effect and this Government will pay a price in the next election. The Government has had opportunities to deal with this issue in the past. It is a situation that has existed for far too long in the case of another ferry company on the Irish Sea route, Swansea Cork Ferries. That was once a State company. It was co-owned by Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Kerry County Council and Glamorgan County Council in Wales. As the company could not run the line productively it was sold to a consortium. The way that consortium has run it since has been by replacing an Irish based workforce with a cheaper eastern European crew.We cannot allow this policy to continue. We must make a stand. If the Government is not prepared to do it, it is time it stood aside and let others in the House, who are prepared to take the responsibilities of Government seriously, do so.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	450	As my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, said yesterday evening, I regret that the House has to debate a matter as unwelcome as the situation at Irish Ferries. This society has laboured long and hard to develop change management and dispute resolution machinery to address the very kind of situation now causing such concern, not only to this House, but also to the wider Irish society. In my comments this evening I wish to concentrate on the employment rights and dispute resolution aspects of the present issue rather than on specific aspects which, of their nature, are particular to the international maritime sector.At a time when this society has reached what is in effect full employment, it is unacceptable to come across a situation whereby long serving employees of a company are being pressurised into vacating their jobs so that these may then be offered to new employees at much lower rates of pay. The fact that the mooted rates of redundancy payment are relatively generous and apparently attractive to many does not mitigate matters. From the information available, this is a forced sale as the company appears determined to change the conditions of service at all costs. This approach to change management and industrial relations negotiations goes against the widely accepted social norms expected in Ireland in recent years.Unwelcome as this situation is, I stress that the circumstances are quite unique in that the international rules governing employment in the maritime sector do not allow the application of Irish labour law and the Irish social protection framework to employees of foreign registered vessels serving Irish ports. Regrettable as this situation is, it does not pose a threat to conditions of employment in the wider Irish economy where Irish law and Irish social standards continue to apply and where these can and will be legally enforced.Governments cannot prevent job losses in individual firms engaged in a market economy. The accelerating pace of change is a sometimes frightening aspect of a dynamic economy. Our response must be to maintain and renew our enterprise base, increase our skills levels and embrace the capacity to be flexible and adapt to changing circumstances.As a society we should take encouragement from our success in surmounting the challenges of the global trading environment. From 1997, when the unemployment rate was 10.4%, we have achieved the lowest unemployment rate in the EU at 4.2%. This is all the more remarkable when set against the growth in the number of people at work, which has risen by 462,000 to 1.9 million, an increase of 31.4%. However, such hard-won gains are easily lost if we do not continue to upskill and innovate.Some sectors and companies will do better than others in meeting customer needs and in responding to competition. However, the situation we are now facing appears, from the information available, to be quite different in that what is proposed has been contrived to enable the replacement of an existing work force by a new work force paid at a much lower level.While Irish Ferries is not the first Irish company to face serious challenges in a rapidly changing economic environment, its proposed response appears not to have been influenced by what has worked for other companies in areas such as investment in people, employee motivation, staff training and flexible work practices. The company has done little to convince the Irish public, who constitute the bulk of its customers in one category or another, that what is proposed is absolutely necessary or, indeed, that it constitutes an effective response in the longer term. Neither is it clear what changes in work practices at the company are necessary to cope with new challenges.Some comfort, however, may be drawn from the fact that the matters at issue are now to be considered, somewhat belatedly, within our industrial relations bodies which have commanded respect over the years by addressing the most intractable of problems. This process should have begun earlier.These are difficult issues which are causing great distress and disquiet. It is worth reflecting on how much worse matters would be if we did not have an agreed social partnership model to underpin relationships, support dispute settlement and advance towards our agreed goals. I wish to restate mine and the Government's ongoing commitment to social partnership which, as is stated in the amendment to the motion, will give us a framework for the future, for building on our strengths and for overcoming difficult problems as they will inevitably arise. Our social partnership is adapted to our needs, enabling us to tackle the problems arising from the ever increasing pace of economic and social change, by means of tried and trusted engagement. All have benefited from social partnership; we all have an obligation to contribute to its continuation.There are those who properly seek to test the continuation of our partnership model. The only tests I would apply are whether it has succeeded in meeting our agreed objectives — it has — and whether it will meet the challenges of the future — it will if all contribute. Social partnership, however, will fail the test if there is not an open and honest engagement now and in the future. There is no place for free riders in social partnership. There is no place for those who take the benefits but do not contribute.My door is open to further engagement with the social partners on the employment rights framework to ensure proper compliance and enforcement. These are issues of concern to all which can be addressed effectively through social partnership rather than by abandoning it and all its achievements. In that context I have made it clear that the Government is willing to engage with the social partners to deal with the whole area of compliance and enforcement. I have allocated additional resources to the labour inspectorate. If further resources are to be made available I am prepared to discuss with the partners the best model to ensure future better compliance.The Government is open to reform and change in the existing models. It has been in discussion with the social partners on the subject of the various approaches which might be adopted on compliance and enforcement of the labour laws. We are open to engaging with the social partnership in developing new models if this is the agreed best way forward. I have had some discussions with the social partners who have said it is not all a question of throwing more in resources but there is a case to be made for reflecting on the working of the current model, particularly in the context of any additional resources. The Government hopes to be in a position to engage with the social partners on that issue soon.It is with the confidence that we can tackle problems arising from our commitment to social partnership that I commend the terms of the Government's amendment, which notes that Ireland has in place a full body of employment rights legislation covering workplace relationships between employers and employees. It notes there is no question of employment rights being in free-fall as they have a sound legislative foundation, active compliance systems and robust institutions for adjudication on rights and resolving disputes together with broad social support.The amendment notes with concern the initial reluctance of Irish Ferries to engage with the industrial relations machinery of the State and reminds the parties that our dispute settlement system is based on engagement with, and respect for, our adjudication and dispute settlement bodies. To act otherwise will only exacerbate the situation.The Government amendment notes the institutions of social partnership will continue to contribute to the attainment of agreed goals and that they have played a role in ensuring engagement with the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, a process in which the Government urges all parties to participate fully. The amendment endorses the actions taken by the Government to date in supporting the Irish maritime sector. It also calls on Irish Ferries to reconsider its proposal to outsource employment on its Irish Sea routes and to examine alternative viability options for these routes.Our amendment to the motion notes the applicability of national and international maritime law in the area of ship registration and the Government's current consultation in relation to ship registration legislation. It also recognises the importance of shipping in the handling of Ireland's imports and exports and the high cost to the economy of any interference with our strategic shipping services.Finally, the amendment notes the Government's intention to request the Irish maritime development office to carry out a thorough evaluation of the results of existing strategies to promote the Irish maritime sector, including the successes achieved to date and the issues to be addressed going forward, particularly in light of recent developments, and to make recommendations accordingly for consideration by the Government.Reference was made to my absence this evening, but I was informed that I was due in the House at 8.02 p.m. to speak on this matter. Last evening I was in Luxembourg, attending a meeting of the Competitiveness Council on behalf of the Government. That is why I could not attend the debate yesterday and there was no intended slight to Members.

I thank and commend my Independent colleagues for coming together on this important issue. This is an opportunity to show our citizens that the Independent Deputies from Marino, Kildare, Dublin's inner city, Tipperary, Galway, Sligo, Monaghan and Clare can work together in the Dáil on issues like low pay, disabilities, the health service, the environment, the peace process and international affairs. Let the message go out from this House that the Independent Deputies are a strong voice in the Dáil as well as in their local communities. Independent Deputies will be staying on the pitch and will always be a voice for the poor, the sick, the disabled, the elderly and working people generally.I totally deplore the proposal to sack 543 workers, who are on trade union rates of pay, to be replaced by exploited migrant workers with appalling conditions and wages. Low pay is wrong. It is time to nail this issue to the mast. Some companies and employers want us all to go back to the dark ages. Some Members of this House, including members of the Cabinet, want to see low pay and exploitation of workers here, as part of a right-wing economic agenda. We, as legislators have a duty to challenge them at all levels. We challenge them in this House tonight because the proposal from Irish Ferries will have an effect on the rights of workers in the future, both Irish and migrant.I condemn the greed driving this strategy, as evidenced by the fact the chief executive of Irish Ferries was paid €687,000 last year while the eastern European workers that the company proposes to employ will be on €3.50 per hour, less than half the current legal minimum wage in this State. I also deplore the support which the employers' body, IBEC, publicly gave to the strategy of Irish Ferries, thus making a mockery of its claim to be in partnership with workers and trade unions.I challenge the hypocrisy of this Government. It is pretending to be critical of the Irish Ferries proposal yet it paid a grant of millions of euro to that company to make 150 workers redundant on the MV Normandy, to be replaced by exploited labour. I also condemn the growing tendency in the construction sector — in my constituency, at the Dublin Port tunnel works — the meat industry and the hotel and catering trade, to exploit migrant workers at the expense of permanent jobs on trade union rates of pay and with decent working conditions.I demand that Irish Ferries abandon its proposal immediately. I also demand that the Government introduces legislation to outlaw ship owners and operators using flags of convenience to trample on workers' rights. I urge all Deputies to support the motion, which is about Irish Ferries, low pay and justice for workers.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I repeat my assertion that the Government's handling of this motion last night and tonight is an insult to this House and its Members and to the workers in Irish Ferries. There are at least two senior Ministers involved in this area, namely, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. If one Minister had to be elsewhere, the other should have come into this House to listen and respond to this debate. This is a debate which goes to the very heart of society, not just the economy. It is simply not good enough that a senior Minister was not on the Government benches last night or tonight to hear the voices of the Opposition and Government backbenchers on this issue.However, this behaviour is typical of the Government's response. The Government amendment is a washing of hands with regard to this issue. This ties in with the fact that, not too long ago, the Government gave a grant of €6 million to Irish Ferries to do exactly the same on the MV Normandy as the company is proposing to do now. It sacked 150 workers on that occasion and now it proposes to sack 543 workers. This Government gave the company €6 million to do that and created a precedent for the action which this deplorable company has now proposed.The Government's response is also typical, given what we have seen at EU level where the former Minister for Finance and current EU Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy, has supported the EU Services Directive which, if passed, will ensure that service providers from other EU countries will only have comply with the pay, conditions and consumer rights legislation of those countries. In effect, we could have services provided by eastern European companies in Ireland, with workers paid at eastern European rates and under eastern European consumer legislation.The first two points in the Government amendment assert that Ireland has a full body of employment rights legislation which covers the workplace relationships between employers and employees and that employment rights are not in free-fall. The Minister is well aware of the Gama Construction situation, where the so-called legislation that is in place was simply not good enough to deal with the difficulties that arose and the manner in which workers' rights and entitlements were trampled upon. This Government must show some backbone. It must come into this House with emergency legislation to ensure Irish Ferries cannot do what it is proposing. This is a deplorable proposal which, if allowed to progress, will have the effect of a bad apple in a barrel and will completely rot the barrel in a short period of time. It is up to the Government and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to introduce emergency legislation to stop Irish Ferries doing what it is proposing and this should be done sooner rather than later.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I wholeheartedly condemn the actions of Irish Ferries in proposing to sack 543 workers who are on trade union rates of pay and established working conditions and replace them with vulnerable migrant workers on appalling wages and conditions. It is a disgrace, in this day and age, that people can be treated in such a manner. The workers in Irish Ferries have been given no choice in that if they do not give up their jobs, they will face unfair exploitation by having their wages reduced and their standards of employment lowered. This is something we cannot accept in our society and the Government should be doing its utmost to protect the rights of our workers. If Irish Ferries is allowed to get away with this disgraceful behaviour then every other company that is driven purely by greed and commercial profits, will seek to behave in the same manner. It is time the Government made a stand against this type of rot in our society.The Government amendment suggests that there is no question of employment rights being in free-fall in this State. We need only consider what happened to the Gama Construction workers to see if it is telling the truth. There are several other examples of workers being abused and the Government failing to take appropriate action to prevent such abuses. The Government is elected to represent the views of the people, not solely the views of greedy companies driven by profits at the expense of their workers. It is time the Government put a stop to the dismal behaviour and practices taking place in Irish Ferries. The Government is part of the social partnership, as are the workers and citizens of Ireland. Why is it ignoring the partnership agreement and kowtowing to greedy employers who are abusing not just Irish workers, but the non-national workers they propose to bring in as slave labour?I call on the Government to withdraw the amendment and accept the actions stated in the Private Members' motion, which is a true reflection of justice and fair play.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I commend strongly the Independent Deputies for making an important contribution to workers' rights in this country by tabling this motion. I find it reprehensible that, apart from The Irish Times, not a single other organ of the millionaire-owned press has covered the debate so far. The exposure of the criminal waste of taxpayers’ funds in the health information technology services was widely reported, and rightly so, but what beckons in Irish Ferries is more fundamental to the future shape of this State.I welcome members of the Seafarers Union of Ireland to the debate and, last night, members of SIPTU Seafarers. That Irish Ferries blatantly proposes to sack 543 seafaring workers who are on established trade union rates of pay and conditions and to replace them with cruelly exploited labour is a shameful indictment of the Government. There has been huge hypocrisy in the course of the debate, including from the Taoiseach. It is time there was a modicum of honesty, including from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Not a single Government spokesperson explained why it subsidised exactly the same sharp practice within the past 12 months when Irish Ferries sacked 120 workers on the MV Normandy and replaced them with the same cheap exploited eastern European workers? If it is wrong now, why was it not wrong then? The Government has not explained this, nor has anyone else. Therefore, the condemnation from the Government benches is hollow. Is it any wonder that the marauding capitalists at the helm of Irish Ferries felt brazen enough to go from sacking 120 workers to sacking 543 workers? It is because they were encouraged by the Government, among others.What is at stake here is enormous. On a personal level, there is the shattering reality for a whole swathe of young people who have worked on the Jonathan Swift and other ships for four or five years, who have taken on mortgages, started families and built their future on the strength of these jobs, and who now see their futures being devastated because of the greed of Irish Ferries.If Irish Ferries management is allowed to institutionalise a regime of semi-slave labour, every greed-driven boss in the State will salivate uncontrollably at the prospect of following suit and doing exactly the same, because they will see they can maximise their profit on the strength of exploited semi-slave labour. The fact that the bosses in IBEC, the national organisation of employers, endorsed strongly Irish Ferries and its strategy of exploiting cheap labour, should send a warning shiver through the psyche of every Irish worker and every migrant worker who wants to work in conditions of justice in this State.Many references have been made to the fact that this is a breach of partnership. It is obvious that partnership is a flag of convenience for big business, IBEC and Irish Ferries to take the benefits when it suits them and kick the workers in the teeth when it does not. IBEC and the Construction Industry Federation did not utter a word of support through the hard months of struggle of the Turkish workers in Gama Construction, despite the fact that what the company was doing was a shame on their industry.Far from being shocked at Irish Ferries, last night the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources echoed the arguments of Messrs. Rothwell and company. He virtually made the philosophical arguments under which they are carrying out this disgraceful strategy. The proposals of Irish Ferries are based on the morality of the 18th century slavers in modern-day conditions. It threatens with extinction the entire inherited body of maritime experience invested in the workforce. Crucially for Irish Ferries workers, for an island nation to allow this to happen would be recklessness beyond measure. The fact that it is for personal greed makes it outright criminality. Tens of millions of euro have been invested to try to have maritime experience and expertise, but it is being thrown away.The Government is doing exactly the same as it did with Aer Lingus, which is privatising. Aer Lingus workers should shiver in anticipation because Irish Ferries was a publicly-owned company in the same way as Aer Lingus. Is the fate that awaits these workers, if the bosses get away with it, the future for Aer Lingus workers being privatised at the behest of the Government?The Irish Ferries workers have been steered by the Government towards the Labour Court. They have been steered towards rocks rather than to a safe harbour. When Irish Ferries proposed 120 workers from MV Normandy, the Labour Court told it to go ahead because it is happening all over the place. What kind of comfort or consolation is it now to refer the 543 workers to the same body if the same rules will apply?The workers must look to their own strengths. I urge the Seafarers Union of Ireland and SIPTU to use industrial action to ground Irish Ferries to stop this disgusting policy of exploiting vulnerable east European labour. The trade unions in Ireland should take joint action with French trade unionists. There should be Europe-wide trade union action that no modern-day slavers are allowed to ploy the waters of the European Union.What about the talk we heard during the course of the EU referendums of the charter of rights and workers' rights endorsed in the EU? We were lectured. Where are they in respect of 543 Irish workers who face this threat? Why does the Government not introduce emergency legislation?A few months ago, the Garda made great play of raiding lap-dancing clubs where young women from eastern Europe were being exploited. Their sisters and brothers face bonded labour aboard the banana boat flagships and are being exploited similarly. Has any garda been sent aboard to check this exploitation?This type of exploitation is rampant in the meat industry. Irish workers, or migrant workers who want trade union rates, are frozen out of the meat industry. This practice is becoming rampant in construction and other areas. It is extremely serious for the future. If these industries get away with this, especially when there is a downturn in the economy and sharp competition for work, there will be a danger of racism and xenophobia.The Government amendment is breathtaking in its cynicism and it should be rejected. I urge the entire trade union movement to recruit migrant workers right across the board so no boss can engage in the type of grotesque exploitation planned by Irish Ferries for its ferry services in the years ahead, if the company is allowed to get away with it.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the issue of A Better Future Now, a position statement on the psychiatric services for children and adolescents in Ireland, which was published in September by the Irish College of Psychiatrists. I congratulate the Irish College of Psychiatrists, especially its sub-group, Dr. Brendan Doody, Dr. Amanda Burke, Dr. Brenda Dowling, Dr. Finbarr O'Leary, Dr. Philip Tyndall and Dr. Sarah Buckley, for the excellent work they have done.In excess of 200,000 children have a mental or behavioural problem at any one time. In excess of 100,000 will have a mild disorder, 80,000 will have a moderate to severe disorder and 20,000 will have a disabling disorder. According to the Irish College of Psychiatry, which drew its information from reports in the Minister's possession — this document is based on reports to the Minister — to effectively deal with this serious problem would require 236 inpatient psychiatric beds. Currently there are 20 beds in two units based in Galway and Dublin.To effectively respond to the psychiatric needs of these children requires 150 consultant child and adolescent psychiatric posts. Currently there are 62 psychiatrists in this field of the profession. The lack of psychotherapists, family therapists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and other key staff seriously inhibits the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatry services through multidisciplinary teams.There is currently no capacity in child and adolescent psychiatric services to provide for children in the 16 and 17 age group. There is an urgent need to establish a specialist outpatient team providing a regional service with an inpatient facility to specialise in eating disorders. The report points out that there is no dedicated facility for those suffering from eating disorders.The World Health Organisation states: "The lack of attention to the mental health of children and adolescents may lead to mental disorders with lifelong consequences, undermines compliance with health regiments and reduces the capacity of societies to be safe and productive".Given the level of mental illness in children, the provision of adequate and sufficient children's mental health services should be a priority. For children who require mental health interventions, services and supports are seriously out of step with need. There is limited availability of the appropriate range of services, including those in primary care, community care, inpatient services, day centres, rehabilitation services and outreach services to provide support in the home and school.The frequent need for urgent responses to problems presented by adolescents leads services to deal disproportionately with adolescents at the expense of their work with young children, thereby preventing useful early intervention which has a secondary preventative value.I am struck by the international comparisons of the ratio of the number of child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists to the child and adolescent population. Having some knowledge of the Finnish system and its pioneering work in the area of suicide prevention in the early 1990s, I note that Finland has a ratio of one child psychiatrist to 6,000 children. In Ireland, the figure is one psychiatrist to 16,150 children.In 2003, 11,200 children and adults, mostly adolescents, presented at accident and emergency departments in our hospitals having attempted suicide. We do not know the true figures, however, and there is no information on those who were treated at general practitioner level or the many who, because of stigma, did not seek help. It was indicated to us yesterday that the figure is probably double the 11,500, approximately 20,000, as stated in the Joint Committee on Health and Children. Over 40% of suicides are preceded by a previous attempt. Suicide is nearly always related to mental and behavioural disorder and the availability of accessible mental health services is of vital importance in any suicide prevention programme.The report outlines that the recommended service level for children up to the age of 18 years would require an extra annual expenditure of approximately €80 million and a capital investment of approximately €180 million. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the €180 million is similar to the amount spent on PPARS and the €80 million is similar to the amount spent on consultants for PPARS. What happened in that case would fund the total capital investment and the ongoing investment for one year. Since 1997, the proportion of the health budget has dropped substantially and we would like the Minister to address that in the budget.Having closely worked with Amnesty International in drawing up its report, Mental Illness: The Neglected Quarter, I will conclude by quoting from the report. It states: "Amnesty International is concerned that Ireland does not comply with its international obligations in the treatment of children with or at risk of mental illness".
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on today's Adjournment.As the Deputy is aware, in June 2000, a working group on child and adolescent psychiatry was established to make recommendations on the way child and adolescent psychiatric services should be developed in the short, medium and long-term to meet identified needs. The working group's first report considered the development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD-ADHD. All aspects of the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and management of children suffering from ADD and ADHD were considered by the working group in the course of its deliberations.In its report, published in March 2001, the different components of treatment required were set out and the importance of adequate linkages with other services, such as education services and the community health services, were emphasised.The group recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with this condition. The working group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multidisciplinary team.The first report also recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent inpatient psychiatric units for children ranging from six to 16 years should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have been established to develop child and adolescent inpatient psychiatric units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and one in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview. Approval was given earlier this year for the selection of project design teams for the units in Cork, Limerick and Galway. The second report of the working group, published in June 2003, contains proposals for the development of psychiatric services for people in the age group 16 to 18 years old. It recommends that, in the further development of the child and adolescent psychiatric service, priority should be given to the recruitment in each health board area of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric disorders of later adolescence.The working group's report further recommends that arrangements should be made with the relevant adult services for the admission to acute psychiatric units of persons aged 16 to 18 years, under the care of the consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric disorders of later adolescence, where such a consultant is available. It also recommends that consideration be given to the development of specialist adolescent units particularly in the greater Dublin area.The report emphasises the importance of co-operation and close liaison between child and adolescent mental health services and adult mental health services and suggests that the current arrangements, whereby the adult services provide a service to the population of their catchment area, including the 16 to 18 years age cohort, should continue on an interim basis, pending the development of the specialist service referred to earlier.The development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has been a priority in recent years. Since 1997 additional revenue funding of more than €20 million has been provided to allow for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams, and towards the establishment of further teams. This has resulted in the funding of a further 23 child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists. Nationally, there are now 56 such psychiatrists employed.An expert group on mental health policy was established in 2003 to examine all aspects of our mental health services. This group consists of 18 highly experienced people serving in their personal capacity. The membership encompasses a wide range of knowledge and a balance of views on many issues affecting the performance and delivery of care in our mental health services.The group requested submissions from interested organisations, individuals and the general public in October 2003 and received almost 150 submissions which it is considering. It has been decided also to undertake further consultation initiatives with various stakeholders, including users of the mental health services.The group is examining the future direction and delivery of our child and adolescent psychiatric services and is taking into account the document to which Deputy Neville refers. The expert group is on target to complete its work later this year.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	474	The Ceann Comhairle must share my frustration. I thank the Minister for coming in a little sooner than he expected to do. He deals regularly with the groceries order and I want to bring to his attention the situation as it applies to constituents of mine who feel particularly vulnerable at the prospect of the groceries order being abolished, or changed in a way that will not take account of their situation.I refer particularly to the dairy farmers in my constituency. They have suffered for many years and their numbers have dwindled from 200 in the 1960s to 22 in the north of the county. Their cost base has been growing throughout that time. Quota prices have been cut from €2.50 to €2. Since enactment of the legislation on veterinary prescriptions the cost of veterinary care is growing, particularly for mastitis.I ask the Minister to examine the practice in the retail sector whereby essential items such as milk or bread become the focus of low-cost selling. These items are used as quite ruthless retail methods to bring people into a shop and so increase competition. The producer is the victim of this practice. The portion of income spent here on food continues to fall, a trend that is bad for both the economic and physical health of the country. As the Minister is a former Minister for Health and Children he no doubt has an interest in that matter too.I ask him to take into account when considering the groceries order that the Irish Farmers Association and many others have argued strongly that the trend making it difficult for liquid milk producers to stay in business will push many over the edge. Already there is the case of imported milk being brought to Virginia to make a so-called Irish cream liqueur. The basis of our economic success is to include traceability and provide an authentic product. The Minister should note that this will be difficult to maintain, as will the livelihoods depending on it, if we do away with the groceries order.The number of registered milk producers has dropped in the past ten years by more than 22% from 3,500 to 2,700. Due to increased productivity the volumes of milk produced remain relatively stable and that hides the reality that fewer people are able to earn their livelihood from primary food production, particularly in the liquid milk sector.If I had more time I would discuss the other sectors such as fresh produce. The vegetable sector is suffering considerably. The number of potato growers in my constituency and around the country declined by more than 50% in the past eight years. Vegetable growers declined by 40% in the past five years. As a former Minister for Health and Children, the Minister will appreciate that we must prioritise food in the retail sector, and the livelihood of the producers. If we abolish the groceries order without taking account of the primary producers, particularly the liquid milk producers, we will become more dependent on imports that will have neither the traceability nor quality of food produced here. Neither will they have the same quality since food miles are not simply a matter of the energy consumed. The closer the food is produced to the consumer, the better its quality and dependability. I ask the Minister to take account of the salient facts that have been strongly brought to my attention by liquid milk producers in my constituency, reflecting a nationwide concern that the groceries order stands between livelihood and oblivion for many. I ask the Minister to ensure that it is maintained on that basis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I thank Deputy Sargent for raising this matter on the Adjournment.At the outset, I should state that I have no role regarding quota prices received by dairy farmers. Most of that area has normally been dealt with at European level regarding the various reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy. My colleagues, the former and present Ministers for Agriculture and Food, Deputies Walsh and Coughlan, have performed in an exemplary fashion in negotiations on behalf of Irish farmers.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	479	That is the reality throughout Europe. It is equally important to point out that the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 does not cover vegetables, and when people talk about such matters, how can we blame it? If it were removed next week, it would be convenient for people to blame it for everything that has happened in recent years, which Deputy Sargent has articulated. I am aware of the importance of competition in all sections of the economy and at all levels of markets for goods and services in the State, including the supply, wholesale and retail levels of the Irish grocery market.The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 contains several provisions aimed at curbing anti-competitive practices such as below-cost selling, so-called hello money and boycotting. The order covers all grocery goods, as well as intoxicating liquor and other household goods ordinarily sold in grocery shops. However, it does not cover fresh fruit, vegetables, fresh or frozen meat or fish. Enforcement of the order is the responsibility of the Director of Consumer Affairs.Since its introduction, the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 has continued to be contentious and provoke much debate. The most controversial provision in the order is the ban on below-cost selling or, more correctly, the prohibition on selling at below net invoice price, which is really what the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 is. Those who oppose the order argue that this provision prevents retailers from passing on to consumers any discounts or rebates that they receive from suppliers not shown on the invoice. In many respects, the order does not protect suppliers from the demands of retailers, since the latter can demand higher discounts from suppliers, and very often do. There is a lack of transparency in that regard. It is a myth that the order protects suppliers against the big multiples. It does not.Members will be aware that in March 2005 the Government-appointed consumer strategy group recommended that the order be revoked in its entirety. However, the report acknowledged that there are strong arguments to be made on either side of the debate. For example, listing the arguments that it received for retaining the order, the consumer strategy group noted that suppliers considered that a fair trading environment helped them to increase production and employment in the sector. On the other hand, the group noted the report of the competition and mergers review group which in 2000 stated that "the main case against the groceries order is a simple one: it restricts price competition".Accordingly, the Government, at its meeting on 3 May 2005, agreed with my proposal to undertake a public consultation process on the future of the order. Advertisements were placed in the national press on 18 May and interested parties were invited to submit their views on the future of the order by the end of July. There was a great response to the consultation process, with 561 submissions received from a wide range of parties, including trade groups, producers, retailers and a significant number from the public. Submissions were also received from producer interests, including the Irish Farmers Association and the ICMSA.Those submissions have all been considered, and a comprehensive report on the consultation process is being finalised in the Department. I expect that the report will include recommendations regarding what action is appropriate on the order, and I will carefully consider its findings before making recommendations to the Government.I appreciate that many producers and retailers have strong views on the order and many do not agree with the consumer strategy group's call for its repeal. However, I am also aware that suppliers are already under pressure to reduce costs as a consequence of competitive market forces. That is a fact of commercial life and has little or nothing to do with the operation of the groceries order. The Irish retail groceries sector has changed immensely since the order was introduced 18 years ago, with small, independent operators facing increased competition from the expanding multiples. One significant development in that regard has been the entry of the German discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which have acquired a significant foothold in the Irish market and plan to expand further.That continued expansion by the multiples has increased competition in the sector, giving consumers more choice than ever before, and I welcome any positive measures that provide additional competition and benefits for consumers. However, I also recognise the continuing important role played by the smaller operators in the sector. I am pleased to see the way that many of the independents and non-multiple groups have responded to that increasing competition by developing their operations.I am already on record as saying that the retention of the order in its current form is not a tenable proposition as the structure and trading practices of the groceries market have changed very considerably since the order was produced in 1987. However, I assure the House that I will obviously carefully consider my Department's report on the outcome of the public consultation process in detail before I bring any proposals to the Government on the future of the order.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this very important issue on the Adjournment.Last Monday there was confirmation of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Brazilian herd. Before that, countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea had already banned the importation of beef from Brazil because of the risk of importing foot and mouth disease.I understand that earlier today the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced a proposal to ban Brazilian beef from specified regions. That does not go far enough since all Brazilian beef should be banned immediately. The reason that I call for such a ban and that the Minister's action is inadequate is that the most recent EU Food and Veterinary Office report on the Brazilian beef industry, carried out in May 2004, expressed serious concerns about such issues as animal traceability, vaccinations, animal movement systems and slaughterhouse hygiene. The office found in the case of Brazil that significant food safety issues persist. Such deficiencies are of serious concern to Ireland given that Brazil is our largest supplier of imported beef.In early 2003, when the office previously inspected the control systems in place in Brazil from the farm to export stage, similar complaints regarding the structures in place were identified. It is of considerable concern that the inadequacies regarding hygiene and traceability systems in Brazil remain unresolved, based on the most up-to-date information available. Deficiencies identified in that report include identification and certification of animals, farm registration and movement controls. Even the central database had several inconsistencies in it. However, the two most damning comments in that report concerned the control of EU exports, the first stating that: "A number of deficiencies identified in respect of animal identification and movement control undermine the possibility to trace back to the farm of origin." The second was: "Mistakes were noted in respect of the examination of muzzles for FMD in one establishment and no strict separation between EU and non-EU eligible meat in the chilling rooms in another."If the Minister is talking about a partial ban on the importation of beef, both those concerns raised by the EU Food and Veterinary Office are a damning indictment of the proposal and the decision by the Minister today. Those comments were made by an independent agency appointed by the EU to carry out such inspections, but the Minister is prepared to ignore that information and only ban beef from certain regions in Brazil.I would like the Minister of State to answer two simple questions. First, why was the inspection of the Brazilian meat industry due to take place last April postponed after it had emerged that the Brazilian tagging and traceability scheme had been abandoned? How, when those systems are not in place, can the Government reassure farmers that their animals are protected from the risk of foot and mouth disease and the public that there is no real or significant threat to the Irish economy? An outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country would have a disastrous impact on the economy as the national herd and the economic survival of livestock farmers are at stake.The Minister's piecemeal approach is entirely inappropriate. It is imperative that there is an immediate and outright ban on Brazilian beef. When the Minister decided to act on this, she should have done so with conviction by taking the only course of action that would ensure the protection of our national herd and our economy. Instead of keeping the situation under review, the Minister must take decisive action to shut down the importation of Brazilian beef.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this important issue. An outbreak of foot and mouth disease in cattle and pigs was confirmed on a farm in the Eldorado district of Mato Grosso do Sul in the southern part of Brazil on 8 October 2005. This development was communicated to the OIE, the World Organisation for Animal Health, on 9 October 2005. The OlE indicated that the disease virus type is currently unknown and that the Brazilian authorities have implemented controls in the district where the outbreak was detected and in contiguous districts to prevent any movement of animals and animal products.The European Commission assessed these measures and today presented a proposal to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, on which my Department was represented, to suspend imports of de-boned and matured beef, not alone from the regions of Mato Grosso do Sul and Parana but also São Paulo. This will be effected by amendment of Council Decision 79/542/EC. The implementation of today's decision will have a significant impact on exports of beef from Brazil to the EU.In regard to trade in agricultural products, the EU generally applies the so-called regionalisation principle which allows trade to continue from unaffected regions. In practice, this means that where there is a disease outbreak, restrictions on trade are applied to products from the affected region while trade can continue from other unaffected parts of that country or region. This principle was applied to trade here during the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001.Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat, as well as to imports of these products from third countries. It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in and trade between member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.I am satisfied that the action agreed today is the appropriate response to the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Brazil. We will keep the position under close review in conjunction with the European Commission and other member states. Council Decision 79/542/EC establishes the sanitary conditions for the importation into the EU of certain live animals and the meat and meat products of such animals. It details the areas of third countries that are approved for the production and export of animals and meat products to the EU as well as the model health certification that must be provided by the competent authority of the exporting country.The Commission's caution in proposing to extend the scope of the measure to include the region of São Paulo is to be commended. The Commission made this proposal on the basis of concerns in regard to the possible movement of animals from the area where the outbreak was reported. The Commission's proposal was adopted by the standing committee this afternoon. Accordingly, beef produced in the regions and from cattle slaughtered since 29 September 2005 may not now be traded.The measures have immediate effect throughout the EU and are being applied to imports by my Department's approved border inspection posts, BIPs. Imported meat can only enter the EU through an approved BIP where it is subjected to veterinary examination and public health checks in accordance with EU requirements. Each member state is responsible for carrying out the BIP checks on its territory. The EU Food and Veterinary Office, monitors the application of import controls by BIPs throughout the EU.

This direction required ComReg to use regulatory and enforcement tools, where necessary and subject to relevant requirements under European and national law, to support initiatives to develop broadband and remove regulatory barriers, if any exist, to such initiatives. ComReg was required to have a particular focus on the residential and SME sectors, balanced regional development, and the potential for broadband provision on alternative platforms. The goal set for ComReg was to be at, or better than, the EU 15 average, excluding accession countries, for end-user access to, and usage of, broadband by mid-2005. Going forward, the acceleration of local loop unbundling should stimulate improved broadband offerings.In 2004, there were over 80 Internet service providers, today there are over 156 companies listed by ComReg, with at least 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly, and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future. In essence, there are broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to any broadband customer in Ireland right now. The rate of uptake is dependent on access by the service providers to suitable infrastructure.The latest quarterly data report from ComReg on broadband delivery rates indicates that broadband subscriptions have grown by 15% in the last quarter and stand at 175,000. DSL remains the largest platform for broadband access, representing 80% of subscriptions and a growth rate of 44% in the last quarter. Fixed wireless broadband services have exhibited the fastest growth in subscriptions in the broadband market. Cable subscriptions have grown by 25% in the quarter and represent around 8% of total broadband subscriptions.The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase 1 of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget. This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start early in 2006. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These metropolitan area networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.In June 2004, the contract for management of the Government and local authority regional metropolitan broadband networks was awarded to E-Net, a company based in Limerick. The term of the contract is 15 years. E-Net operates as a wholesaler of access to the MANs and offers a full suite of products including ducting, sub-ducting, dark fibre, high level managed capacity, co-location facilities and relevant auxiliary services.My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area, with each application being assessed by the Department's technical advisers. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.A joint industry-Government fund of €18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the beginning of 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning and in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources's wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. Funding arrangements are also in place for the updating of computer networks and equipment within schools. The construction-installation phase is now under way, and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on my Department's website, www.dcmnr.gov.ie.

These objectives are: to create an environment that encourages the maintenance of high quality Irish radio and television services by both independent broadcasters and RTE; to secure a viable future for high quality public service broadcasting; and to seek to retain access to a range of high quality programming in analogue and digital form on a universal and free-to-air basis.My key priorities for achieving these objectives include the following: developing the regulatory framework by bringing forward a Bill to provide for the establishment of a single content regulator for both public and private broadcasters and to establish RTE on the lines of a company under the Companies Acts; taking steps to establish TG4 as an independent entity; ensuring adequate public funding for RTE and TG4 so that they can deliver on their statutory mandate; building on progress made in maximising the effectiveness of television licence fee collection; developing proposals to ensure that in a digital era Irish viewers continue to enjoy access to a range of high quality programming; and bringing forward proposals for the future licensing of radio services in Ireland.I am of the opinion that Irish viewers will be best served by a broadcasting environment that includes a strong public service broadcasting presence in the form of RTE and an independent TG4, together with private broadcasters. Digital television offers opportunities for Irish viewers to avail of an increased number of broadcasting services, including new services of particular relevance or interest to Irish audiences.

The regulation of telecommunications operators, including regulating of pricing for phone services, mobile phone termination costs, quality of service and competition in the mobile market is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and regulations made under the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications. The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have responsibility for overall telecoms policy. My main goal in this policy is to create conditions for sustainable growth and competition that will benefit the economic and social development of Ireland and facilitate competitive services. It is my belief that improving the market conditions to enhance competition is the best way to drive down mobile phone charges to the end user. The more competitive telecoms services that are on offer, the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy.In March 2004 my predecessor issued policy directions to ComReg, including a direction on competition. The direction on competition mandates ComReg to focus on competition as a key objective, with a particular focus on competition in the fixed and mobile markets and to implement, where necessary, remedies which counteract or remove barriers to entry and support entry by new players to the market and entry into new sectors by existing players. ComReg has, as one of its key objectives, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the promotion of competition in the exercise of its functions. Competition in the fixed and mobile markets will drive down prices for consumers.I have no information to say that Irish mobile charges are generally the highest in Europe. However, ComReg's quarterly key data for the Irish communications market for the second quarter of 2005 indicates that the Irish mobile operators' average revenue per user is the second highest in Europe; Switzerland has the highest.The high penetration rate of 94% for mobile phones, representing 3.83 million subscribers, and the recent rollout of 3G services in addition to the existing mobile phones demonstrates that there is a wide range of choice for Irish businesses and citizens.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	487	As clearly set out in the programme for Government, this Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these social benefits.The An Post network comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country. In the European context, Ireland still has the highest number of post offices per head of population. In recent years some network restructuring has been undertaken. This activity is in line with similar trends across Europe.Specifically, in relation to the closure of post offices or sub-post offices, it is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found or where there are no applicants, that a post office is closed. It is the Government's objective to maintain the largest, economically sustainable post office network possible. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size.While the Government will support the network in any way it can and has demonstrated its commitment in a tangible fashion, with a €12.7 million capital injection in 2003, the way forward is for An Post to enhance existing services and, building on existing strengths, to develop new product offerings. The network has a high footfall and to capitalise on these advantages it is essential that existing and new services are developed to meet customer requirements. The network also has the capacity and potential to deliver more private business especially in financial services and opportunities are actively being pursued by An Post in this area.On foot of substantial investment in computerisation, a significant amount of extra business has already been obtained for the network in terms of banking and utility business. At present 95% of An Post's business is conducted through automated offices. Also under way is a new pilot scheme to automate a total of ten smaller post offices. This will allow the company to determine to what extent, if any, further investment in automation might be justified. The results of this project will be evaluated at the end of the trial period.I have also asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network and in this light An Post is currently working on a new initiative which could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 285 together.Since 1996 there have been offshore petroleum discoveries or "shows" at four locations: the Corrib discovery in 1996 in the Slyne-Erris Basin west of Ireland; the Seven Heads Field, originally discovered in 1984 but declared commercial in May 2002; the Connemara discovery in 1997 in the North Porcupine Basin west of Ireland; and the Dooish discovery in 2002 in the Erris Basin. Of these only the Corrib and Seven Heads were declared commercial five years ago. Since then the Seven Heads Field has experienced serious production difficulties and is producing at a fraction of the level originally planned. Given these difficulties any estimate on its commercial value is meaningless. The value of the Corrib Gas Field is tentatively put at €3.67 billion. While this is lower than the current price I point out the difficulty of predicting prices for 15 to 20 years into the future. The Connemara and Dooish discoveries have not been declared commercial.On the development aspect of discoveries, Seven Heads is already in production albeit at a very reduced level. The development of the Corrib continues and the Deputy will be aware of the difficulties there. I point out that the Corrib gas was discovered in 1996 and will not start production until 2007 or even 2008 at the earliest — 11 or 12 years later.No new economic deposits of non-petroleum minerals have been discovered in the past ten years. There have been some encouraging results, however. Exploration adjacent to existing base metal mines at Navan, County Meath — New Boliden Tara Mines Limited — and Galmoy, County Kilkenny — Arcon Mines Limited — has discovered additional resources which have the potential to extend the life of those mines. I have recently granted new State mining licences to Arcon for extraction of part of these additional resources and my officials are currently in discussions with New Boliden Tara Mines Limited on the terms for new facilities to extend the underground workings to the south-west and north of the existing operation. Details of all current leases and licences for extraction of minerals, including royalty terms, are included in the six monthly report laid before the Oireachtas under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999. The value of these deposits to the companies concerned is a matter of commercial confidentiality. However, I expect that substantial royalties will be paid to the State on foot of these discoveries.A good zinc prospect area near Pallas Green, County Limerick also has the potential to host an economic deposit. Exploration is continuing but it is too early to say whether it will prove an economic deposit.The acid test of commerciality with any new discovery is that having made a find, the explorationist is then prepared to invest in planning for mining and therefore makes the necessary applications for permits to me, the relevant local authority and the EPA, and can raise the substantial funds required to bring a mine into production.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	489	As the Deputy is aware, in November 2004 the all-island energy market development framework was published jointly by Mr. Barry Gardiner, MP, the then Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and myself. The framework document, which was produced in collaboration with the two energy regulators and involved widespread consultation with industry and other energy stakeholders, sets the policy context for the creation of an all-island energy market. It includes a high level development programme, setting out goals and timeframes over a range of policy areas.As the Deputy is probably aware, the key priority within the framework is to have an all-island wholesale electricity market in place by 1 July 2007. The two regulators are making good progress and have agreed the high-level principles that will govern the operation of the single market. I understand they are aiming to agree the detailed rules for the market by February 2006. This process involves close consultation with stakeholders.A key task for both Governments is to ensure that an appropriate legislative framework is in place to underpin the single electricity market. While full implementation of the market by July 2007 presents a very challenging timeframe in which the necessary parallel legislation must be enacted, my officials have been working closely with their northern counterparts and the two regulators' offices to ensure that this target is met.While the main priority is the creation of the single electricity market, the framework document also outlines policy for all-island collaboration in a number of other areas, including gas and sustainable energy. My officials have had discussions with their northern colleagues on the gas agenda and, together with the regulators' offices, have commenced the task of developing a project-driven work programme for the delivery of the objectives outlined in the framework.With regard to sustainable energy, in July my northern counterpart, Angela Smith, MP, and I published a preliminary consultation paper on an all-island vision for renewable energy to the year 2020 and beyond. The consultation period recently ended and the response has been very encouraging. The aim is to develop a long-term strategy for renewable energy on the island as a whole.A number of infrastructural projects are also in progress. Bord Gáis Éireann is set to complete the construction of the North-South gas pipeline from Gormanstown to Belfast in 2006. In addition, a second North-South electricity interconnector is expected to be operational by 2012.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 132 and 173 together.Digital television is already available in Ireland. Both cable-MMDS operators and satellite operators provide subscription digital television services to an estimated 40% of Irish television households. It is estimated that 28% of households receive analogue cable-MMDS services, and 32% of households avail of analogue terrestrial services as their sole means of receiving television broadcasts. It is also estimated that up to 90% of households receive analogue terrestrial transmissions on at least one television.Analogue terrestrial television services are provided on a free-to-air basis. Over time it is expected that analogue terrestrial services will migrate to digital terrestrial services in most countries. This migration is already happening on a significant scale in a number of European countries.I am committed to the long-term provision of a free-to-air digital terrestrial television, DTT, platform in Ireland. DTT can provide much more to the free-to-air viewer in terms of additional channels, improved quality of service, innovative new services, including data and interactivity, and increased availability of public and government information. I have proposed that a digital terrestrial television pilot programme be developed in Ireland. The purpose of the pilot is to bring further momentum to the transition to digital terrestrial broadcasting and to test and trial various aspects of the service. I have asked my Department to implement the pilot and procurement processes are under way.There are a number of stages to the pilot programme. Current procurement processes focus on the multiplex and transmission aspects of the pilot programme, essentially the construction of the necessary digital terrestrial television infrastructure. I expect that agreements will be in place on foot of procurement by the end of the year and that the infrastructure will be rolled out in early 2006. The initial transmission sites are at Clermont Carn in the north-east and Three Rock covering parts of the Dublin region. Once the pilot infrastructure is in place, broadcasts of various programme and data services can commence. It is expected that the pilot programme will continue for up to two years. As the pilot programme is subject to procurement, the actual costs of rolling out and operating it will become clear through competitive procurement processes.I expect that the pilot programme will generate awareness and discussion among broadcasters, investors and other interested parties to move towards a full national rollout of DTT in time. I will be engaging with interested parties in this regard as the pilot programme commences and I will look to the Irish broadcasting sector to play an active role in the development of proposals for national DTT rollout.A legislative framework for a national rollout of DTT is set out in the Broadcasting Act 2001. I will amend the existing statutory provisions, if necessary, to facilitate the introduction of DTT in Ireland.As the pilot programme is developed and proposals for a national DTT rollout emerge, I will outline my intentions regarding possible dates for a switch-off of analogue to digital terrestrial television broadcasts. Free-to-air analogue terrestrial transmissions will continue for a period after the national rollout of digital terrestrial television has begun. At a certain point analogue transmissions will be turned off and the full switchover will then be complete. While the pilot programme is under way, I intend to hold comprehensive discussions with all relevant stakeholders around the timing of analogue switch-off. Switch-off of analogue television services is being strongly advocated by the European Commission, with 2012 a target date suggested by the Commission. When decisions have been taken about the nature and timing of analogue switch-off, it will be necessary to ensure that Irish viewers are fully informed of all the issues arising, such as issues around reception equipment replacement. All stakeholders will have a role in informing viewers of the likely changes.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	491	With globalisation, liberalisation and developments in technology which are changing the way people communicate, all national postal operators, including An Post, have to change very rapidly to stay competitive and commercial in the European postal market. This reflects the change in the market from one dominated by letters to one dominated by parcels and direct mail. Both of these areas are much more open and attractive to competition, especially international competition, than the traditional letters business. Competition in the sector is growing and at present there are 26 firms operating in Ireland with a postal service authorisation from ComReg.Ireland has fully implemented European Directives 97/67/EC and 2002/39/EC, which set out the requirements for member states on the provision of high quality postal services and liberalisation within their postal networks. Under the directives, each member state is obliged to provide a universal service whereby a minimum level of service must be provided. Both of these directives have been transposed into Irish law in Statutory Instrument 616 of 2002 European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations. The statutory instrument also provides for further liberalisation of the postal market. Since the transposition of the directives, the weight limit applying to postal items falling within the reserved area and therefore not open to competition has been reduced to 100 g from 2003 with a price limit of three times the basic tariff for domestic and inbound international. The reserved area will be further reduced to mail weighing 50 g or less and two and a half times the basic tariff from 2006 for domestic and inbound international. Outbound international mail was fully liberalised on the 1 January 2004.The second directive also stipulates that the postal sector is to liberalise across the EU in full on 1 January 2009 subject to political agreement. I understand that the next steps for the Commission include a study to be completed on the impact on the universal service of the full accomplishment of a liberalised postal market. Based on the outcome of this study, the Commission will present a report to the European Parliament and Council by 31 December 2006 accompanied by a proposal confirming, if appropriate, the date of 2009 for the full liberalisation of the postal market or to determine alternative steps in light of the study's conclusions.Furthermore, under the statutory instrument, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, has been designated as the national regulatory authority for the postal sector. Ireland has adopted a light regulatory approach to liberalisation so as to encourage and maximise the number of postal operators that might wish to enter the market.The postal sector in Ireland needs competition especially in light of the many internationally traded sectors operating in the country but it also needs An Post to be competitive. I believe that liberalisation and the expected increase in competition will ultimately be good for both An Post and consumers and that the company can continue to be a significant and strong player in the market post-liberalisation.

Bilateral contact between my Department and the Department of Industry in the UK has clarified that the Minister recently sounded a note of caution for UK businesses that do not book firm gas supplies and capacities in advance. Such businesses may face interruption of supplies in the event of colder than average weather conditions. The choice between booking firm or interruptible gas supplies is a commercial decision for individual businesses.The UK National Grid's winter outlook report was published last week. It concluded that below average winter weather conditions, gas supplies and power generation capacities are sufficient to meet all demand for gas and electricity. If winter weather conditions are extremely cold, then there is a programme in place in the UK to reduce gas demand without leading to power cuts.In Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation has responsibility for monitoring on an ongoing basis the security of natural gas supply. The commission publishes an annual gas capacity statement. This provides a forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand to assess the adequacy of the Irish gas transmission system. The gas capacity statement also considers whether projected supplies of gas, from indigenous sources, imports and storage, are sufficient to meet forecast demand. A key finding of the 2005 gas capacity statement is that even under unusually cold weather conditions, the Irish gas transmission system should cope with forecast demand.

The increased use of Internet protocol technology is changing the way telecommunications networks are designed and operated. It is expected that the early adoption of this technology will lead to the more cost effective delivery of telecommunications in the future.A number of telecommunications operators providing service in the Irish marketplace have already deployed this technology in their telecommunications networks. In addition to this, a number of the group broadband schemes, which my Department is grant aiding, have indicated that they will be deploying this technology for the benefit of users connected to their networks.My Department is considering announcing a call in the near future to assist operators in the trial and adoption of VoIP technology. It is hoped that this will help to accelerate the take up of this technology and the delivery of cost effective telecommunications services to the public.

This land will be developed as a mixture of residential, commercial and retail properties, in addition to public spaces. The private developers will compete on the basis of bids of cash plus office space. The office space will be handed back to the Digital Hub Development Agency and will be used to accommodate an increased number of digital enterprises in the area. These tenders must be submitted by 18 November for evaluation.In relation to industry development, the agency has been successful to date in growing the cluster with about 50 companies now employing approximately 400 employees in the hub. These enterprises are involved in a range of activities including games software development, mobile technology, animation and TV production.In relation to the social and community development remit of the hub, the agency has operated the Liberties learning initiative, which uses technology to tackle social and educational disadvantage in the area. Supported by funding from Diageo Ireland, the programme delivers a range of learning and showcasing projects focused on the creative use of digital media and reflects the national priorities of building a knowledge-based society and addressing the digital divide.In addition, the schools programme of the Liberties learning initiative has developed a range of programmes in 16 local primary and second level schools aimed at addressing the digital divide. These include providing information and communication technology, ICT, equipment and technical support to local schools, providing professional training to teachers so they are fully informed about the education benefits of ICT, and advising and informing the schools of employment opportunities in the digital sector. The schools programme aims to equip local children with the skills needed to live in a digital age, and to work in the digital media industry, which will be located on their doorstep.In relation to digital research and development, I intend to establish a national digital media research and innovation centre, the National Digital Research Centre, NDRC, in the hub, subject to a satisfactory proposal being put to me. The Higher Education Authority, on my behalf, has invited proposals for the establishment and management of the proposed centre. The proposed centre will complement existing Government initiatives focused on digital media and technology enterprises and assist in the development of the Digital Hub district.

If the Commission were to initiate such a proposal, I would, of course, give it very careful consideration.In 1998, there was an EU Commission proposal: Commission communication on a common policy on manning of regular passenger and ferry services operating in and between member states, COM/98/0251.A key provision of the Commission's draft directive was its Article 2.2 which states "If the vessel used is not registered in a Member State, the terms and conditions referred to shall be those applicable to the residents of one of the Member States between whose ports the service is provided and with which the service has the closest connection. The closest connection shall be determined on the basis of the place from which the service is effectively managed." The European Parliament approved the proposal in March 1999. The Commission issued a revised proposal in 2000, COM/2000/0437. However, no final agreement was reached in the Council of Ministers on the matter and the Commission formally withdrew the proposal in August 2004.

To date in Ireland, 675 MW of renewable capacity has been connected with a further 175 MW under active construction. Further development will also take place from the last two rounds of competitive tendering, the AER V and AER VI competitions.Last month, I announced a new support programme to further increase the contribution to electricity production from renewable energy sources. This new programme will move away from the competitive tendering model to a fixed price scheme. This means that any applicant, whether an individual or company, may submit an application at a fixed price based on technology and, in the case of wind, the capacity of the project.In the area of alternative fuels, the biofuels mineral oil tax relief scheme was launched in April this year and has resulted in eight biofuels projects being awarded excise relief for a period of two years. Excise relief of €6 million will be allowed for these projects, over a two-year period to 2007. It is anticipated that this will result in 16 million litres of biofuels replacing imports on the Irish transport market during that period. The scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development.In addition to these initiatives, Sustainable Energy Ireland administers a series of programmes aimed at supporting the integration of renewable technologies and sustainable energy practices across all sectors of the economy. Its programmes include: the house of tomorrow programme which supports sustainable energy practices in Irish housing, by providing grant aid to developers of groups of housing; the public sector buildings programme which supports the development of energy efficient public sector buildings; the renewable energy research development and demonstration programme which aims to stimulate deployment of renewables close to market and address the need for information and education; the large industry energy network which promotes sustainable energy best practice in industry; and the low income housing programme which aims to upgrade low income households with energy efficiency features. SEI has a budget of €16.1 million in 2005 for the administration of these and a range of other sustainable energy programmes.I am fully committed to the development of our renewable resources and I believe that the combination of these programmes is serving to ensure the increased deployment of renewable and alternative energy within Ireland's electricity, heat and transport markets.

As Minister with policy responsibility for the electronic communications sector, I can issue strategic policy directions to ComReg, as I may consider appropriate, in the interest of proper and effective regulation of that market.As recently as March 2004, policy directions were issued by my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, including one on broadband. This direction required ComReg to use regulatory and enforcement tools, where necessary and subject to relevant requirements under European and national law, to support initiatives to develop broadband and remove regulatory barriers, if any exist, to such initiatives.The Deputy may be aware that LLU was the subject of a court case earlier this year. ComReg directions to Eircom in relation to LLU were found to have denied Eircom's right to appeal to the Electronic Communications Appeals Panel. ComReg's directions were subsequently withdrawn and ComReg is working with Eircom and the industry on the issue.

A scheme under the Act was agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance and was launched in April 2005. A total of 34 applications were received under the call for proposals by the closing date. The proposals were evaluated by my Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, and recommendations were made to the Minister for Finance, and eight projects were awarded excise relief under the scheme. Of the eight projects, four were pure plant oil, three were biodiesel or other biofuel, and one was bioethanol. Excise relief of €6 million will be allowed for these projects, over a two-year period to 2007. It is anticipated that this will result in 16 million litres of biofuels replacing imports on the Irish transport market during that period. The scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development.Under SEI's renewable energy research, development and demonstration, programme capital grant aid is also available for biofuels market demonstration projects in the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories. Funding of almost €250,000 has already been awarded to support engine modifications of up to 100 vehicles and provide plant and monitoring equipment.In addition, SEI has provided grant aid of €40,000 to Teagasc, for a study to establish oil quality testing procedures for pure plant oil. This study will be critical to building market confidence. SEI also provided funding for the publication of a resource study on recovered vegetable oil and animal fats and study on quality assurance for rapeseed oil as a vehicle fuel.An interdepartmental biofuels group was established in 2004 to consider policy options for the development of the biofuels market and to consider these options from the perspectives of the sectors or interest represented by each Department. It comprises representatives from my Department, the Departments of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Finance, Transport and Agriculture and Food and SEI. As part of its work, the group commissioned a Liquid Biofuels Strategy Study for Ireland, which was published by SEI in December 2004. The report examines the full range of options and potential supports for liquid biofuels development in Ireland, including bioethanol and biodiesel. The targets achievable for biofuel production and distribution in Ireland depend on a variety of factors including availability and end-use of agricultural land and the levels of indigenously sourced or imported feedstock or biofuels.The national climate change strategy sets out the strategies and targets for meeting Ireland's Kyoto commitments. Implementation of transport initiatives in the national climate change strategy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has lead responsibility for Government policy on meeting Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol. I understand that work on a review of the national climate change strategy, taking account of developments since its publication at the end of 2000, is currently in progress in his Department.The number of applications in the pilot scheme clearly indicates the strong interest there is in developing a biofuels industry in Ireland. I have had contact with the Minister for Finance about the possible scope for scaling up fiscal support for biofuels. Further measures to increase market penetration over a longer timeframe are also being considered in consultation with all the relevant Departments.

In 2001 the council submitted a report prepared by consulting engineers on the estimated cost of the Ballycotton Harbour development plan. The proposed development was estimated to cost a total of €6 million.Cork County Council applied for funding in 2002 under the marine tourism grant scheme of the national development plan for a development including a marina at Ballycotton, County Cork. However, as the applicants had not obtained the necessary statutory permissions, their application could not be considered further. The applicants were informed of this and that they could apply for funding under a future call. No funding was available for the grant scheme in 2003, 2004 and 2005. The findings of the mid-term review of the regional operational programmes recommended the reallocation of funds to other priorities.The Ballycotton Harbour Development Association recently submitted a summary of an updated proposed development for Ballycotton Harbour to the Department. The proposed development consists of ten phases over a year and a half and is estimated to cost a total of €3.07 million.The allocation for the fishery harbours development programme is €20.55 million for 2005. There was no Exchequer funding available for Ballycotton in 2005. The fishery harbour programme involves co-funding by the local authorities and the updated proposal for development at Ballycotton would have to be submitted by the local authority. In this case Cork County Council would be required to submit its updated proposal to the Department and be prepared to contribute 25% funding to the project.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	501	Prior to 1995 the oil companies in Ireland were obliged to meet a substantial portion of Ireland's oil stockholding obligations. This system proved unsatisfactory however, and under the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations 1995, responsibility for the maintenance of strategic oil stockholding was removed from the industry and vested in a new State body, the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, which, for pragmatic reasons, was set up as a subsidiary of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC. NORA acts as the agent of the Minister with the function to arrange for the holding of strategic oil stocks at a level determined annually. Such stocks may be held directly by the agency itself or on its behalf by third parties at home and-or abroad.Following a thoroughgoing review of the functions of NORA by my Department, it was determined that NORA should be established on a statutory basis as a stand-alone State body under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. On 21 July 2004, the Government approved the drafting of the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill. Following work by my Department and its legal advisers, and liaison with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has recently furnished a draft text of the Bill to my Department. It is anticipated that the Bill will be settled and published by the end of the year.

I may give instructions to ComReg to meet the costs incurred by the appeals panel, in accordance with the framework regulations, however, this does not form part of the overall deliberations.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	503	The development and continued viability of An Post and the post office network, is in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of An Post. I believe that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post, both in delivery of mails and as a quality service provider through its nationwide network of post office outlets. The market for traditional postal and post office services is changing globally and meeting customer needs has become more important than ever. In order to remain competitive, An Post needs to make the best possible use of its long established and trusted brand name and deploy its resources in a manner which continues to serve existing customers' needs and attracts additional customers for a range of new services.There is agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future. With this in mind, the board and management of An Post have presented a recovery plan, incorporating details of proposed new collection and delivery arrangements, which I believe is vital to the re-establishment of the company on a more secure financial footing. The plan has assumed significant changes in work practices, tariff increases and the payment of wage increases. It sets out the way forward for the company. Adoption of restructuring that delivers real change is the only way that An Post workers can look forward to receiving pay increases in line with other sectors. To this end, I have continuously emphasised the need for all stakeholders in the company to work together in a partnership approach and to utilise the industrial relations mechanisms of the State, where necessary, in order to agree and implement the recovery strategy to return the company to financial stability and prepare for the challenges ahead.In order to progress the change agenda, an exhaustive process of negotiation between An Post management and An Post trades unions, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and then the Labour Court, was entered into. This process was recently concluded with the court's recommendation that the company accept the proposals as set out by a three-person expert group on the proposed new collection and delivery arrangements. The court also recommended that acceptance of the productivity agreement was contingent on the balance of increases being paid out under the Sustaining Progress agreement. It is my understanding, however, that, on 5 September 2005, the Labour Court's recommendations were rejected by the main union in An Post, the Communications Workers Union. A three-week cooling off period has followed in which every effort was made by the parties to resolve the issues. I understand that, following a special delegate conference, the union has now decided to ballot its membership for industrial action up to and including strike action. The ballot will be concluded by Friday, 21 October.With regard to the future of the post office network, the Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network as set out in the programme for Government. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these social benefits.As a commercial company, the challenge ahead for An Post is to develop a strategy that satisfies the needs of existing customers, while attracting new customers into the post office. An Post has already had some success in winning new business and continues to benefit from a considerable amount of Government business, especially in the areas of social welfare payments and savings products. In addition, a pilot project is under way which involves the automation of ten small post offices.In light of the need to ensure the long-term viability of the network, An Post is working on a new initiative which would see the development of An Post financial services. Its aim is to supply a wide range of retail financial services through the branch network. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	506	In January of this year, I launched the Government's ports policy statement. The policy statement aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs. One of the key challenges that lies ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade. The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner.As an initial step, the Department sought information from the commercial ports which handle unit load cargo on key projects identified by them as essential to deal with anticipated capacity deficiencies to 2014 and beyond and whether the ports see these as being funded from their own resources or in partnership with the private sector. In its response to this request, Drogheda Port Company provided information to the Department concerning its proposal for the development of a new deepwater port at Bremore. The timeframe for the proposed development and the preparation of a detailed business plan are matters for Drogheda Port Company in the first instance.As indicated in the ports policy statement, it is intended to prioritise a range of projects catering for unitised traffic at our commercial ports from an overall economic national and regional perspective, as opposed to the perceived requirements of individual ports. To that end, the Department recently appointed Fisher Associates consultants to advise on refining the criteria to be used for project evaluation; drawing up a uniform template for submission of detailed project proposals; assessing the scope for efficiencies within existing areas of ports handling unitised trade; and evaluating the projects submitted with a view to the Department's recommendations to Government. As an initial step in their assignment, I understand that Fisher Associates will shortly consult with ports, including Drogheda, and other key stakeholders in relation to the criteria to be used for project evaluation.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	507	The Regional Advisory Council to which the Deputy refers is the RAC for north western waters. This covers the waters to the north, west and south of Ireland, to the west of Scotland, the Irish Sea and the English Channel; which are the waters of primary interest to Irish fishermen. I was delighted to welcome the RAC to Dublin Castle for its inaugural meeting on 30 September.This is the third of a proposed seven RACs to come into being. The principle of establishing RACs was agreed as part of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002, as a means of increasing stakeholder involvement in and ownership of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, as well as improving communications and relations between fishermen and other stakeholders. The mechanism for establishing RACs was agreed at political level in May 2004 under the Irish Presidency of the EU. Subsequently, Bord Iascaigh Mhara was appointed as the secretariat of the north western waters RAC. The Commission declared the RAC operational on 22 September 2005.The structure of the RAC for north western waters consists of a general assembly, an executive committee and four area-based working groups. These consist of two thirds fishing industry representatives and one third other stakeholders. The six member states involved in the RAC are Ireland, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK. The general assembly of the RAC will meet at least once a year. The executive committee will be the main decision-making body of the RAC, consisting of 24 members and meeting at least three times per year. The working groups will carry out the detailed work of the RAC which will then be considered by the executive committee.I am delighted at the successful inauguration of the RAC on 30 September. I am especially pleased that the RAC has signalled an intention of getting down to business quickly by holding its first working group meetings early next month. This will enable it to have an input into the process following the publication of scientific advice on the state of the stocks and leading up to the decisions on total allowable catches, quotas and fishing effort limitation to be made at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in December. It is by having a meaningful input into the serious issues facing the sector that the RACs can establish their credibility and contribute to the sustainable management of fisheries, and I am confident that they can achieve this objective.

I am in the process of identifying a mediator to undertake this work.On 25 August last I appointed Advantica consultants to conduct a safety review of the Corrib onshore upstream gas pipeline. This review is currently under way. The review includes a public consultation process and a two-day public hearing in the locality. The public hearing commenced this morning. Pending the outcome of this review, Shell E&P Ireland Limited has, at my request, ceased all works on the onshore pipeline. In addition, it has ceased works on the offshore pipeline to allow for a period of public discussion and dialogue. The company will use this time to address remaining public concerns.The development of the Corrib gas field has received all required approvals and consents from my Department as required by law. My Department is responsible for the regulatory aspects of petroleum exploration and development. Authorisations were granted for the Corrib gas field under a number of provisions. Under the Continental Shelf Act 1968, authorisation was given for the construction of the sub-sea facilities within the continental shelf designated areas by my predecessor. My predecessor also gave consent for the plan for the development of the field under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960. Under the Gas Act 1976, as amended, consent was given for the construction of a gas pipeline from the gas field through the offshore up to the terminal building. A foreshore licence was also granted under the Foreshore Acts. In accordance with EU environmental impact assessment directives, an environmental impact statement was carried out and submitted with each application for consent or approval.

To meet this target Ireland needs in the region of 1,450 MW of renewable capacity connected. Currently Ireland has 675 MW of renewable capacity connected with a further 175 MW under active construction. This consists of 400 MW of wind, 240 MW of hydro with the balance made up of different biomass technologies. Further development will also take place from the last two rounds of competitive tendering, the AER V and AER VI competitions.To, at a minimum, achieve our target, 400 MW of new renewable capacity will be supported and this will be increased to accommodate any slippage rates from previous competitions.Earlier this year I announced, in outline form, the next support programme to further increase the contribution to electricity production from renewable energy sources. This new programme will move away from the competitive tendering model to a fixed price scheme. This means that any applicant, whether an individual or company, may submit an application at a fixed price based on technology and, in the case of wind, the capacity of the project. There are ample proposed onshore projects available to deliver the capacity that can be connected without compromising the continuity of electricity supplies generally. However, the cost to consumers of supporting additional offshore projects is significantly higher than similar onshore projects. A total of 85 MWs is one conservative estimate of the short-term market interest in offshore projects. The net additional cost above the onshore costs of supporting 85 MW of offshore wind capacity is calculated at €139 million over the guaranteed 15 years, at June 2005 energy prices. This additional charge, plus VAT, would add directly to the cost of the public service obligation levy.The detailed draft terms and conditions of the proposed feed-in support programme were posted on my Department's website, www.dcmnr.gov.ie, in draft form, on 29 September last and interested parties have until today to raise any queries or to furnish any observations on the proposals, as published. Following a consideration of any details raised the new programme, to be known as the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, will be put in place.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	514	On 17 June 2005 Dublin Port Company wrote to me to the effect that the company had received notices of intention from a tenant to acquire the fee simple interest at the Irish Glass Bottle site. In the first instance, this is a matter for the company and I understand it is procuring legal advice in the matter. Dublin Port Company has a number of legal defences available to it and these will be relied on to the fullest extent. This is a complex and technical area of law and Dublin Port Company is taking further legal advice in the matter.Turning to the second element of the question concerning the port company's plans for a second site opposite the Point Depot, the Department received a letter from Dublin Port Company on 18 May 2005 requesting ministerial approval for its proposal to enter into an arrangement with a consortium as detailed in draft heads of terms attached to the letter. This agreement relates to a plot of land opposite the Point Depot. The company states that, in essence, the proposal provides that, in the event that the consortium is successful in its bid for the development of the national conference centre and appropriate planning and other consents issue in respect of the national conference centre, Dublin Port Company will make available a site in order to facilitate the development of the national conference centre together with further and complementary commercial development.I can inform the Deputy that some advice has been received from the Attorney General on 29 July 2005 in this matter and that further advice is awaited. A reply to the Dublin Port Company letter of 18 May 2005 requesting ministerial approval in this matter will issue when all the necessary advice is to hand and fully considered.

As of 1 October last, there were 1,425 post offices. The Deputy should note that of this reduction of 486 in the number of post offices, 306 can be accounted for by postmasters who availed of the terms of the agency conversion scheme since its inception in 2002. The Deputy should also note that, to date, An Post has established 2,864 postpoint outlets in retail premises of which 600 can be used for bill payment.The Government and An Post share the objective of maintaining a viable nationwide post office network through a strategy of maximising the volume of both public and private sector business handled by the network. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these social benefits.With regard to computerisation of non-automated offices, the automated network accounts for over 95% of An Post's counter business. This means that the 996 automated offices transact 95% of counter business while 429 non-automated offices undertake 5% of business. This figure clearly illustrates the level of business transacted by individual non-automated offices. The current level of automated coverage is considered by An Post to be extremely comprehensive by any objective standard and this level of coverage makes it difficult to justify on either customer service or economic grounds the extension of automation to all offices, regardless of their location or business volumes.Automation of the post office network was completed in 1997. It is, therefore, only in very exceptional circumstances, such as an existing automated office closing and its equipment being transferred to a suitable neighbouring location which transacts significant volumes of welfare business, that offices are automated today. Nevertheless, I have asked An Post to undertake a pilot project to automate a selected number of non-automated offices to gauge the effect on new business. Ten post offices have been selected for automation and the results of the pilot project will be evaluated following the trial period.

The primary objectives of the obligation are to ensure reasonable self-sufficiency in electricity generation capacity by utilising peat as a primary fuel source, promote renewable energy sources to help protect the environment and cover costs of generation capacity needed to ensure that customer demand can be met in times of peak demand.The Commission for Energy Regulation is required under section 9(2) and (3) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Public Service Obligations) Order 2002, as amended by SI 217 of 2002, to approve the ESB's estimated additional costs incurred by complying with the public service obligation. These include the administration costs incurred by the transmission system operator, suppliers and the distribution system operator in collecting payment of the obligation levy. The costs are calculated annually, with the sanction of the European Commission, in accordance with parameters specified in the public service obligation notification to the European Commission. The public service obligation levy for a given year is calculated, by the Commission for Energy Regulation, on an ex ante basis.The current wholesale electricity market in Ireland is a bilateral contracts market with a balancing mechanism. The majority of energy traded is contracted under bilateral arrangements between participants. With this market structure, no set market price is available. In the absence of a market price the additional costs incurred by the ESB in complying with the public service obligation are those above and beyond a regulated ex ante best new entrant market price, as published annually by the Commission for Energy Regulation. The increase in the best new entrant has impacted significantly on the public service obligation levy for 2006 as this is the benchmark price against which the additional costs of meeting the public service obligation is measured. Effectively, the public service obligation will decrease by a projected €59 million in 2006 because the best new entrant price has increased.

Subsequently, broadband subscriber numbers have grown by 73%, in the nine months since I set that target, to reach approximately 175,000 by the end of July 2005.There has been no change in the Government target of 400,000 subscribers by the end of 2006. When I set that target, I made it clear to the telecommunications industry that it should be even more ambitious in its broadband plans. I challenged it to increase the roll-out and take-up of broadband services to reach 500,000 by the end of 2006, surpassing the Government target for the same period. I am confident these targets can be achieved.The provision of telecommunications, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent regulator, ComReg. ComReg's register of authorised undertakings lists no less than 169 companies offering Internet access services in Ireland with a wide variety of service levels.The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has a broadband website, www.broadband.gov.ie, which gives prices, service levels, locations and contact details of 44 service providers offering a wide range of broadband services from 0.256 megabits per second to 56 megabits per second, using a range of delivery platforms such as cable, DSL, fixed wireless and satellite. A range of broadband technologies can deliver broadband to any customer in Ireland.The rate of broadband uptake is dependent on a combination of factors. These include access by the private sector service providers to suitable infrastructure, as well as competition between broadband service providers and demand conditions for broadband in the economy. The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks in 120 towns and cities nationwide in association with the local and regional authorities. It is also offering funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to support the roll-out of broadband services through the county and group broadband scheme, under which 150 projects have already been approved covering over 450 communities. The provision of broadband to all primary and post-primary schools has now begun and will be completed by early 2006.Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on the website of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources,  www.dcmnr.gov.ie.

It is the initial stage of the process and Ireland will actively participate in the process.Traditionally, the radio spectrum has been licensed on the basis of assigning particular frequency bands for specific uses though variations arise between different member states. This is often referred to as a command and control approach. This approach no longer seems appropriate for electronic communications services in a world of accelerated technical development, where compartmentalisation of services becomes increasingly difficult due to digitisation and convergence with a technology being able to deliver a combination of communications services, such as television, telephony and broadband access.The radio spectrum is managed by member states at the national level and in international co-ordination. The Commission's proposals focus on the development of a harmonised framework and on the introduction of new approaches for managing the radio spectrum, such as a market-based approach. Member states will continue to manage the spectrum in the future.

At the first world summit in Geneva in December 2003, the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, requested a working group be set up to look at Internet governance. While the working group published its report in July 2005, several outstanding issues remain to be addressed. These issues were further discussed in a preparatory conference in Geneva that ended on Friday, 30 September.As there is no agreed position across the United Nations on Internet governance it is proposed to hold a further meeting immediately prior to the summit in the hope an agreed position can be endorsed by the summit. A decision on attendance by me at the summit will be made nearer the date of the conference based on the final documents of the conference, the level of attendance from other countries and any possible national strategic advantages that might arise from attendance.

The results of the measurement of compliance with this target reported that 78% of national mail was delivered the next day during the most recent measurement period. This represents an improvement of 8% on the similar period last year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	523	The economic and social infrastructure operational programme, ESIOP, runs from 2000 to 2006. Within the ESIOP a sustainable energy priority was agreed with part funding from the European Regional Development Fund and co-funding from Exchequer or other national sources.The conditions agreed between the State and the EU require expenditure to be undertaken within two years of the original projection or the loss of the relevant European Regional Development Fund moneys. This is referred to as the N+2 rule. An amount of flexibility is built in to this rule and the national management authority can transfer funding from one priority or spending subhead to another with the agreement of the EU and stakeholders.The sustainable energy priority comprises two measures dealing with energy conservation and with alternative energy. Energy conservation is on target to deliver its investment. The major part of the second measure is the grid upgrade development programme which was intended to fund the capital intensive portion of planned connections, thereby ensuring projects did not fail due to the high capital cost of a connection offer.Getting new renewable energy powered electricity generating plants connected has been a slower and more difficult task than was foreseen when the grid upgrade development programme was put in place. In December 2003 the Commission for Energy Regulation authorised a moratorium on new connection offers to new undispatchable plants due to concerns about overall system stability of the electricity network. This decision and subsequent decisions of the network operators meant no new connection offers for renewable energy powered plants were confirmed between December 2003 and early 2005.A consequence of an absence of new connection offers in this period was that the grid upgrade development programme could not be activated to fund the shared connection asset element of any such confirmed connection offer. Nevertheless the installed capacity is approximately 400 MW-equivalent now and is expected to reach 600 MW-equivalent under the current support programme.The slower than expected delivery of connections following the moratorium and subsequent decisions of the network operators, has made it prudent to reallocate €5 million from this support measure this year to avoid Ireland losing the benefit of these Structural Funds under the N+2 rule. However, the grid upgrade development programme has recommenced and based on current projects on identified demand for projects with a firm or planned connection offer, its purpose and effect will not be in any way diminished by this reallocation. The plan is that as connecting parties are charged for access to the shared asset funding will be reinvested in further projects.

Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these social benefits.As a commercial company, the development and growth of An Post's business is a matter for the company's management and board. The challenge ahead for An Post is to develop a strategy that satisfies the needs of existing customers, while attracting new customers into the post office. An Post has already had some success in winning new business and continues to benefit from a considerable amount of Government business, especially in the areas of social welfare payments and savings products. While the Government will support the network in any way it can and has demonstrated its commitment with a €12.7 million capital injection in 2003, the way forward is for An Post to enhance existing services and, building on existing strengths to develop new product offerings.I have also asked the company to ensure any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network. An Post is working on a new initiative which could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.On foot of substantial investment in computerisation, a significant amount of extra business has already been obtained for the network in terms of banking and utility business. At present 95% of An Post's business is conducted through automated offices. In order to gauge the impact of automation on business generation, I have asked the company to initiate a pilot project to automate ten small post offices. This project is under way and the results of the project will be evaluated after the trial period has come to an end. An Post also enjoys a strong relationship with sections of the population that have no bank accounts, including many social welfare clients. With the roll-out of e-Government services, the post office is ideally placed to capitalise on opportunities arising in this space, especially in the area of e-payments.

My predecessor issued a set of policy directions to ComReg in February 2003 covering flat rate Internet charges, broadband electronic communication networks, industry sustainability, regulation only where necessary, regulatory impact assessment, consistency with other member states, cost of regulation, consistency across platforms, regulation of prices, management of the radio frequency spectrum, and universal postal service. A further set of policy directions was issued by my predecessor in March 2004 on communications issues. These included a general direction on competition and directions on broadband; wholesale and retail telephone line rental; interconnection/leased lines; and national and cross border roaming.A policy direction to the Commission for Energy Regulation was given on July 26 1999, in accordance with section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, providing for a system of contracts and other arrangements for trading electricity. The main objective was promotion of efficient competition amongst licensed generators and suppliers. The interim arrangements established on foot of this direction will be replaced by new arrangements implemented as part of the single all-island electricity market which is due to go live in July 2007. The single all-island electricity market will establish for the first time, a single wholesale market in which generators and suppliers of electricity on the island will trade all their electricity on a daily basis regardless of their location on the island. A key objective is to minimise the cost of electricity to all customers on the island of Ireland.Since I assumed office as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have issued two policy directions to the registrar general of fishing boats, the licensing authority on sea fishing boat licensing policy. Both concern the provision of replacement capacity in the context of the replacement or modification of certain fishing vessels. The directions extended the time to 30 June 2006 in which all replacement capacity was to be provided.

Kinsale-Ballycotton is in serious depletion now. We do not have any oil producing fields. The Corrib gas field is due to go into production in the next few years.Before oil and gas resources can be developed, they must first be discovered. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources takes an active role in the promotion of petroleum exploration. Earlier this year, an area in the Rockall Basin was opened for licensing and two exploration licences were awarded. In March 2006, certain areas in the Slyne, Donegal and Erris Basins will be made available for licensing. This policy of opening areas occasionally for licensing in licensing rounds will continue into the future.The terms governing petroleum exploration and development are kept under review by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. These terms are designed to encourage exploration in the Irish offshore. There are no immediate plans to reform the terms. Exploration and development of minerals is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999. All extraction of minerals under the Acts is subject to payment of royalties to the State. While those Acts will be consolidated and updated in a new minerals development Bill in preparation, it is not proposed to change that policy.

Advancement of these proposals has taken longer than originally anticipated due to the complexity and range of issues which require to be addressed. However, good progress has been made and proposals will be brought to the Government later this year, with publication of the broadcasting Bill in 2006. The legislative proposals will ensure the broadcasting regulatory environment continues to encourage the parallel development of high quality broadcasting by Irish public service, commercial and community broadcasters.

Under the scheme, mineral oil tax relief may be granted for pilot projects producing up to 6 million litres per annum of pure plant oil, 1 million litres per annum of biodiesel and 1 million litres per annum of bioethanol.A total of 34 applications were received under the call for proposals by the closing date. Applications were received under all three categories of biofuel. A total of eight successful projects were selected, comprising four pure plant oil projects, three biodiesel projects and one bioethanol project and excise relief of €6 million has been granted to the successful applicants over two years commencing in August 2005.Ireland has a renewable electricity target of 13.2% of electricity consumption to be sourced from renewable technologies by 2010. To meet this target Ireland needs in the region of 1,450 MW of renewable capacity connected. Ireland has 675 MW of renewable capacity connected with a further 175 MW under active construction. This consists of 400 MW of wind, 240 MW of hydro with the balance made up of different biomass technologies. Further development will take place from the last two rounds of competitive tendering, the AER V and AER VI competitions. To achieve our target, a minimum of 400 MW of new renewable capacity will be supported and will be increased to accommodate any slippage rates from previous competitions.Earlier this year I announced, in outline form, the next support programme to further increase the contribution to electricity production from renewable energy sources. This new programme will move away from the competitive tendering model to a fixed price scheme. This means that any applicant, whether an individual or company, may submit an application at a fixed price based on technology and, in the case of wind, the capacity of the project.The detailed draft terms and conditions of the proposed feed-in support programme were posted on the website Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources,  www.dcmnr.gov.ie, in draft form, on 29 September last and interested parties have until today to raise any queries or to furnish any observations on the proposals, as published. Following a detailed analysis of the matters raised the new programme, to be known as the renewable energy feed in tariff, will be put in place.

There will continue to be a key national role for An Post, both in delivery of mails and as a quality service provider through its nationwide network of post office outlets. The market for traditional postal and post office services is changing globally and meeting customer needs has become more important than ever. To remain competitive, An Post needs to make the best possible use of its long established and trusted brand name and deploy its resources in a manner which continues to serve existing customers' needs and attracts additional customers for a range of new services.There is agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future. With this in mind, the board and management of An Post have presented a recovery plan outlining the steps including comprehensive restructuring and cost savings, which are vital to the re-establishment of the company on a more secure financial footing.I have emphasised the need for all stakeholders in the company to work together in a partnership approach and to utilise the industrial relations mechanisms of the State, where necessary, to agree and implement the recovery strategy to bring about the cost savings and productivity growth required to return the company to financial stability and prepare for the challenges ahead. The Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network as set out in the programme for Government.

These proposals will be considered by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in December.The Commission's proposals for 2006 will be considered in the context of the scientific advice, current measures in place, including recovery plans and effort restrictions, and in consultation with industry representatives in order to determine a national position, taking account of the need to achieve sustainable fishing opportunities for the Irish industry.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, established as a statutory agency in May 2002, implements a wide variety of programmes on energy efficiency and renewable energy on behalf of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Under SEI's house of tomorrow research, development and demonstration programme, financial support is directed at encouraging developers of housing, both new-build and refurbishment, to incorporate design and technology features, which deliver significantly superior energy and CO2 performance. By targeting developers of schemes of houses, from the private or social housing sectors, the aim has been to establish over several years a nationwide network of accessible examples of more sustainable energy design and technology practices. Together with other promotional measures by SEI, this is intended to encourage a sufficient degree of market replication, without subsidy, to elevate energy performance standards across the wider housing stock. This targeted approach is also designed to be an administratively efficient method for deployment of public moneys.To date, the programme has committed over €9 million in funding to 48 projects comprising a total 2,269 housing units. All feature an integrated approach to design, orientation, building fabric and energy supply and use, that achieves performance of at least 20% better than current building regulations and in the majority of projects, 40% better. The sustainable energy features across the range of projects funded include solar hot water systems, ground source heat pumps, condensing boilers, group heating schemes and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery along with higher levels of insulation.The programme has been directed at suppliers and developers of housing, rather than individual householders. This is because the house of tomorrow is a research and development support scheme, not a home improvement grants scheme. It is seeking projects of sufficient scale and impact to influence wide application of the practices and technologies demonstrated. An effective way to achieve this is by means of clusters of homes that will provide regionally visible and accessible examples which can be replicated. Overall, integrated developments are encouraged. A key need in moving towards more energy efficient planning and construction practices in Irish homes is to develop the necessary awareness and capability within the construction industry. SEI, through its consumer awareness programmes, seeks to increase the demand for energy efficiency amongst homeowners and occupants. House of tomorrow, as a research, development and demonstration programme, supports the development and demonstration of capability in the industry to deliver higher quality energy efficient homes to meet such a demand. The aim is to increase standards and practices across the industry as a whole.Regular reviews are conducted on all SEI's funding programmes. Factors entering any such consideration include the establishment of consumer product standards, supplier capability and installation quality assurance systems appropriate to consumer markets. This is in addition to the core requirements of energy and CO2 saving impact, market impact potential, administrative efficiency and ultimately, value for money for the taxpayer.Funding for SEI is determined on an annual basis. SEI submits a proposed work programme for the coming year along with a budget for each of its programmes, such as the house of tomorrow programme, to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Any increase in funding required for these programmes would have budgetary implications and could only be considered in the light of the overall budgetary requirements of SEI and the level of funding available to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.I am keen to see a wider take up of energy-efficient technology in design, building and use of homes. Many of the measures involved are self-financing, with payback periods of as little as two or three years. Increasing the energy efficiency of our building stock reduces our energy imports, reduces our CO2 emissions and saves money for the individual household and for the Exchequer.

The withdrawal premia payable under the scheme are the maximum permitted by EU regulations and are related specifically to the permanent removal of the fishing vessels concerned from the EU register of sea fishing vessels. The scheme implements the recommendations of the Padraic White report, Decommissioning Requirements for Ireland's Demersal and Shellfish fleets, presented to me in early July. The report does not provide for the payment to the crews of the vessels concerned.While the scrapping scheme will remove boats from the fleet right around the coast, the majority of the fleet will continue fishing and will continue to need crew. Many skippers have great difficulty securing crew as there is an overall shortage reflecting the strong performance of the economy generally. In this situation, good opportunities remain for crew members whose current boats are leaving the fleet.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	534	The Government has consistently ruled out buy-out as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks and has instead, since 2002, promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective. Moreover, no convincing case has been advanced as to the public good that would be acquired by the State in a publicly funded buy-out of commercial salmon licences nor why stakeholders benefiting from increased numbers of salmon entering the rivers should not contribute in whole or in part towards achieving that increase.As a result I have no plans to introduce a buy-out of commercial salmon fishing licences. However, I am continuing to review the matter in the context of the policy outlined above. In this regard, I would be open to any relevant proposals presented to me whereby stakeholders benefiting from any reduction in commercial catch would engage in the first instance with licence holders and indicate a willingness to address any compensation issues that might arise. Broad outline proposals have been submitted to me recently, which I intend to consider in the context of any review of policy. Since taking up my appointment I have reaffirmed the Government's belief that the current strategy of developing a sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fishery through aligning catches on the scientific advice holds out the strong prospect of a recovery of stocks and of a long term sustainable fishery for both sectors.In national terms, the latest scientific advice on wild salmon stocks is that 359,002 wild salmon returned in 2004 including 191,579 spawners. Data for 2005 will not be available until full analysis of the exploitation during the 2005 season has been completed by the fisheries boards and the Marine Institute. While there remains an abundance of salmon returning to Irish rivers, the Government has accepted the scientific advice that reductions in the overall fishing effort are required in order to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide. For this reason, current Government policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement up to the level of the scientifically advised conservation limits as soon as possible. In keeping with this policy, when setting the commercial salmon quotas for the 2005 season, I gave a firm commitment to fully align the exploitation of salmon, both at national and district levels, on the scientific advice by 2007. To achieve this, I have asked the new National Salmon Commission to advise as to how best the alignment of exploitation of salmon with the scientific advice can be implemented by 2007.

Adoption of restructuring that delivers real change is the only way that An Post workers can look forward to receiving pay increases in line with other sectors.To progress the change agenda, I have met with representatives of An Post management on eight occasions over the past 12 months. I have also met twice with representatives of the main union in An Post, the Communications Workers' Union and met also with representatives of the Irish Postmasters' Union on three occasions. I have listened with interest to the views of all parties concerned on the future of the network. I have emphasised to all parties the importance of an early start to the company's modernisation and that both sides must engage directly to resolve long-standing and deep-seated problems besetting the company.

For this reason, current Government policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement up to the level of the scientifically advised conservation limits as soon as possible. In keeping with this policy, when setting the commercial salmon quotas for the 2005 season, I gave a firm commitment to fully align the exploitation of salmon, both at national and district levels, on the scientific advice by 2007.To achieve this, I have asked the new National Salmon Commission to advise as to how best the alignment of exploitation of salmon with the scientific advice can be implemented by 2007. This must be done bearing in mind the requirement to ensure the future biological viability of the salmon resource in all catchments and also the needs of all stakeholders, including those who derive their living from the wild salmon resource. I will examine carefully all recommendations, including those relevant to drift-netting, made by the salmon commission in this regard.

Under the oversight of the Commission for Energy Regulation several measures have been put in place to ensure the development of a grid system that will facilitate the development of distributed or embedded generation. The commission has introduced an autoproducer tariff to ensure equitable treatment for distributed, embedded, and autoproducer generation.The grid upgrade development programme funding is being used to invest in the network in advance of the connection of embedded generation where appropriate. The commission provides financial support for research and is funding a research project in this area. The refurbishment of the distribution network and the building of new substations will ensure the capacity and reliability of the distribution system. The sum of €1.25 billion will be spent reinforcing and renewing the distribution network in the coming five years.The ESB distribution grid has been designed to distribute electricity from higher voltage input points to lower voltage premises, homes and businesses. This is the traditional design of electricity distribution networks, and is the most efficient method of guaranteeing good quality electricity supply across large geographical areas and to large numbers of customers. The investment by ESB Networks in the network renewal programme is designed to refurbish the existing medium voltage network and improve the quality of supply to electricity users. ESB Networks typically needs to upgrade the distribution networks to facilitate the connection of embedded generation. This work is carried out on a project-by-project basis where connection agreements with generators have been signed and the costs of these works are borne by the generator. It would not be economically feasible to upgrade the entire network to allow embedded generation at any point on the distribution network as this would require a great many additional substations and overhead lines to be built around the country.Micro-combined heat and power is not a major feature of the Irish distribution network at this stage. A micro-combined heat and power unit would require the installation of an input-output meter to record levels of electricity travelling into and out of the premises. There is no EU standard for input-output meters. The ESB is working in co-operation with the EU to develop a standard that is expected in 2007. The ESB is monitoring the installation of any input-output meters on the distribution grid to gauge the efficiency of the units and any implications these units have for local networks. For example, if a large number of micro-combined heat and power plants were outputting electricity at the same time in one locality it may result in a power surge to neighbouring premises. There are further regulatory matters surrounding tariff prices and spill prices for electricity produced by micro-combined heat and power units.Domestic customers wishing to install micro-generation units without a requirement to sell their exported units can do so on a fit-and-inform basis, that is, the customer advises ESB Networks of the unit being installed. In most of these cases the actual amount of units being exported would be small, if any. In recent years there has been a rapid development of smaller generation and renewable generation. There is approximately 420 MW of embedded generation plant, that is, connected to the lower voltage distribution system or at a directly-connected demand customer's site. This figure comprises combined heat and power schemes and small thermal units, and renewable generation from wind, small hydro, landfill gas and biomass sources. In the longer term there may be issues, specifically around wind generation, which would result from significant penetration of distributed generation. The commission for energy regulation is monitoring developments in this area.

The IEA keeps the oil market situation under constant review. As a member of the IEA, Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports of crude oil equivalent in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption. At 1 August 2005 Ireland’s oil stock reserves were estimated at 124 days net imports. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has contingency arrangements in place to deal with major oil supply disruptions. In the event of a significant global oil supply crisis, Ireland’s oil reserves would be eked out over an extended period to supplement commercial supplies which would continue to be available, albeit at a reduced level, in the normal course. Reserves provide cover for periods far in excess of their expression in terms of number of days.There would be no question of Ireland attempting to deal on its own with an international oil supply disruption. If such a crisis were to occur, the response, including the release of emergency stocks and the identification of alternative sources of supply, would take place within the framework of the formal emergency regime developed and maintained by the IEA.With regard to the recent hurricanes which hit the US, IEA member countries agreed on 2 September 2005 to offer a total of some 60 million barrels of crude oil equivalent to the market over 30 days as a measure to offset production and refining losses. In accordance with IEA rules, the contributions were based on agreed shares of oil consumption. Ireland's contribution, 0.4% of the total required, amounted to a draw on NORA stocks of some 33,000 metric tonnes of gasoline, equivalent to one and a half days of stock reserves. The cargo was sold, via a tender procedure, and has been shipped to the US.With regard to the UK, while there was a recent threat of a blockade of refineries this did not actually occur and consequently there was no disruption to supplies into Ireland. In the event that such a disruption had materialised I have significant legislative powers to address the situation. Short-term disruptions would probably be met by a drawdown of Government stocks held by the National Oil Reserves Agency into the Irish market.Notwithstanding the stockdraw and normal commercial fluctuations in the volumes of industry stocks that occur, I am satisfied Ireland's emergency stock levels are more than sufficient to ensure we would be in a position to participate effectively in any further internationally co-ordinated response in the event of a world oil supply crisis or manage any short-term disruption specifically impacting on the Irish market.

The additional costs of this programme are funded by a levy on all electricity customers known as the public service obligation, PSO, levy. So far, 61 renewable energy projects have received funding under this programme. Further projects currently under construction will receive funding through the PSO when commissioned.To the best of my knowledge, six projects received funding under Thermie and one under Valoren. These are EU operated programmes and my Department is not involved in their administration.Sustainable Energy Ireland's research and development programmes and alternative and renewable energy projects have been funded under the renewable energy research, design and development — demonstration projects and studies — and house of tomorrow — housing developments with renewable energy sourced heating — programmes. The number of projects in each category with committed funding is 150 projects in terms of renewable energy research, design and development and 21 in terms of the house of tomorrow programme.I recently announced the next support programme to further increase the contribution to electricity production from renewable energy sources. This new programme will move away from the competitive tendering model to a fixed price scheme. The detailed draft terms and conditions of the proposed feed-in support programme were posted on my Department's website, www.dcmnr.gov.ie, in draft form on 29 September and interested parties have until today to raise any queries or to furnish any observations on the proposals as published. Following a detailed analysis of the matters raised the new programme, to be known as the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, will be put in place. REFIT will further stimulate the construction of new renewable electricity generating plant. Successful projects under the programme will receive funding through the PSO.

A broad consultation is taking place across all branches of Government to ensure a joined up and inclusive response to this initiative. There are three main ways to reduce our energy demand: eliminating waste, cutting back on demand, and using fuels more efficiently. Every stage of every process whether industrial, commercial or domestic will yield efficiencies when examined and all these savings will aggregate to form a substantial total. Even while preserving our economic growth, energy efficiency will allow us to reduce our energy demand, meaning a saving on fuel import bills, a contribution to our Kyoto commitment on greenhouse gases and a payback to the Exchequer and to individuals.

In September, I announced the support prices for different technology bands including general biomass price support.The new fixed price tariffs are: large wind energy, over 5 MW, 5.7 cent per KW hour; small wind energy, under 5 MW, 5.9 cent per KW hour; biomass, landfill gas, 7 cent per KW hour; and hydro and other biomass technologies, 7.2 cent per KW hour. It is a matter for the peat station owners to determine the commercial viability of co-firing with other materials based on commercial and environmental considerations. However, the availability of price support as outlined above provides an incentive for fuel switching to be considered.The detailed draft terms and conditions of the proposed feed in support programme were posted on the Department's website, www.dcmnr.gov.ie, in draft form on 29 September and interested parties have until today to raise any queries or to furnish any observations on the proposals as published.

An Post has a remit to be financially viable and, following significant losses which amounted to €43 million in 2003 alone, An Post management invoked the "inability to pay" clause provided for in Sustaining Progress.I believe that an agreement on a viable recovery plan is the only way forward for An Post to deliver quality services to our citizens while at the same time providing sustainable well paid employment for its staff. Therefore, the key challenge for the company is to return to long-term financial stability. In this regard, An Post unions and management were involved in intensive negotiations with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery in a bid to agree a recovery plan that will put the company on a sound footing. The question of Sustaining Progress related payments was addressed in a Labour Relations Commission, LRC, brokered process. Assessors appointed by the LRC recommended that An Post was in a position to pay a 5% increase to its employees. This increase, backdated to 1 January 2005, was paid to An Post employees and pensioners at the end of June 2005. I also understand that the assessors' report finds that An Post cannot afford any further elements of Sustaining Progress or the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress other than in the context of securing finalisation on rationalisation and restructuring requirements.It is my understanding, however, that the An Post unions rejected the assessors' report in its entirety. The matter was then referred to the Labour Court which issued its recommendation on 13 July 2005. The court recommended that on acceptance of the recommendation made in a recent court appointed technical group's report on An Post's collection and delivery service and upon ratification by both parties of the draft agreement annexed to that recommendation, the company should arrange for payment of all 2005 and future increases due under Sustaining Progress. The court further recommended that all retrospective payments relating to the recent 5% increase paid by An Post be made as soon as the company is returned to reasonable and sustainable profit and when commercial circumstances permit.I understand, however, that on 5 September 2005 the Labour Court's recommendations on the issues of Sustaining Progress and collection and delivery were rejected by the main union in An Post, the Communications Workers Union. It is my understanding that, following a special delegate conference, the union has now decided to ballot its membership for industrial action up to and including strike action. The ballot will be concluded by Friday 21 October.

I understand, however, that the overall decline in angling tourism is not unique to Ireland but reflects a trend widespread in Europe. The report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in September 2003 observes a decline in activity holidays which is not confined to angling but also includes cycling and hill walking.While I am aware of the argument that the affect of drift netting on salmon stocks is a reason for the decline in tourism angling in Ireland, I am not aware of any study that supports this premise. I am advised that Tourism Ireland is carrying out research among tour operators involved in promoting special activity holidays. Problems identified include rising costs and access to activities. Tourism Ireland has also identified angling among main areas of activity for which detailed marketing plans have been agreed, targeting the markets offering the best short-term return. Several other supporting activities are identified across all products including greater understanding of international trends in demand for special interest products.It is my belief that the current strategy of developing a sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fishery through aligning catches on scientific advice holds out the strongest prospect of a recovery of stocks and of a long term sustainable fishery for both sectors.

This is regarded as a challenging target to achieve. Currently, we have 675 MW of renewable capacity connected to our system and to reach the 2010 target of 1,450 MW, we will have to more than double the present renewable capacity. Current industry build rate shows that the required level is achievable. The new fixed price feed in tariff support programme that I announced recently will further stimulate construction. The question of what higher target can be set and in what timeframe is one that requires further analysis and technical input, largely but not exclusively in terms of grid and associated economic issues.In July my Northern counterpart, Angela Smith, MP, and I published a preliminary consultation paper on an all-island vision for renewable energy to the year 2020 and beyond. The consultation period recently ended and the response has been very encouraging. The aim is to develop a long-term strategy for renewable energy on the island as a whole.

This falls within the statutory remit of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, the independent regulator for electricity and gas.I am advised by the CER that as regards electricity prices, the regulated ESB public electricity supplier, PES, prices will increase by an average of 4.11% from 1 January 2006. For domestic customers, the increase will be 3.1%, while for large energy users — commercial and industrial — the increase will be approximately 8.04%. However, the tariff increase which will seen by each individual business customer may be higher or lower than these average figures depending on that customer's level of consumption and consumption pattern.Electricity price rises have a modest affect on inflation in the economy. Information supplied by the Central Statistics Office to the CER indicate that for every percentage increase in the retail price of electricity, the impact on the consumer price index is only 0.01774. Therefore, the approved 4.11% increase will add 0.0729 to the CPI. The CER has carried out a detailed review of the costs being faced by ESB PES for 2006 in supplying electricity and is satisfied that the tariff increases allowed are correct to cover these costs.The increase in tariffs for 2006 is primarily driven by increases in the costs of generation for 2006. Oil and gas prices have risen by 50% and 60% respectively in the past year. The average cost of generation to ESB PES has increased from €69.50 per megawatt hour to €89.00 per megawatt hour, wholesale electricity, an increase of 28%.It should be noted that the CER has also approved reductions in transmission and distribution costs. These savings are seen not only by PES customers but by all customers. Transmission tariffs are 6% lower in 2006 compared to 2005, while the cost of distribution is 10.7% lower in 2006. The PSO levy for 2006 is also 60% lower than the PSO in 2005, a fact which will see an overall reduction in fixed charges on most customers' bills. Furthermore the CER has recently completed a five year review for 2006 to 2010 of ESB's transmission, distribution and supply businesses. This review will impose significant downward pressure on these components of the final tariff over the next five years.With regard to gas, the CER approved an increase of 25.26% to Bord Gáis energy supply, BGES, gas supply tariffs for the non-daily metered sector. In its application, BGES requested a revenue requirement of €535.88 million or an overall increase of 33.63%. The effect of the approved tariff increase on inflation is 0.135%.I am advised that the level of price increase was unavoidable due to the high gas costs in the international natural gas market over which neither the CER nor BGES has any control. BGES procures most of its gas from the UK market. Wholesale gas prices in the UK for the year 2005 to 2006 are 69% over last year's levels.

It has been clear for some time that the telecommunications sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband, so my Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed open access broadband networks in association with the local and regional authorities in the major towns and cities. These metropolitan area networks, MANs, will allow the private sector to offer world class broadband services at competitive costs.Nineteen MANs are now completed and a further seven are nearing completion. The second phase of the programme involves the building of MANs in a further 93 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the sector. County Kerry is developing projects in respect of the following towns: Castleisland, Dingle, Kenmare, Killarney, Listowel and Tralee. The route designs are currently being finalised prior to issuing the detailed design invitation to tender. Construction on these projects is expected to commence in early 2006. My Department's website, www.broadband.gov.ie, lists all service providers offering broadband services in all towns in County Kerry and gives contact details for each company with prices for the various service levels on offer.My Department is currently administering the second call for the county and group broadband scheme, GBS. This scheme is designed to promote investment in broadband access infrastructure in rural communities with populations of 1,500 or less by contributing grant aid of up to 55% of the infrastructure costs. The following GBS community projects in County Kerry have been approved to date: Ballyferriter, Boherbue, Brandon, Caherciveen, Kinard, Ventry, north Kerry, Sliabh Luchra and Tarbert.

No data were supplied for Norway. The very high share of renewables in the electricity mix in Sweden and Austria is explained by those countries large hydro-resources. The figure supplied for Ireland by EUROSTAT in 2002 was 5.5%, which is explained by higher hydro-production and lower overall consumption.

As we are all aware, the cost of these internationally traded commodities, mainly oil and gas, have all increased significantly in recent times. Obviously sustained high fuel costs are not good for any economy and reducing our dependency on these imports represents a major challenge for us all. However, notwithstanding these high costs, the ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary, published last week, suggests that Ireland's strong economic growth will continue for the foreseeable future. Economic growth as measured by real GDP is forecast to grow by 5.7% this year and by 5% in 2006.I do not have a function in relation to the pricing of gas or electricity. These are matters which fall under the statutory remit of the Commission for Energy Regulation.With regard to the development of energy policy, I am in the process of preparing an energy policy paper which I aim to have ready for publication early in 2006. While such a policy document must address a range of complex and interlinked objectives, I am anxious to put an emphasis on the challenge of creating a sustainable energy future.

Details are given in the table above. Since then, the main expenditure on eCabinet has been in respect of development rather than consultancy. The software developers are the InVision Research Corporation. The original estimate for the project set out in the PwC feasibility study in 2001 was up to €6.45 million at 2001 values. The fixed price contract negotiated with InVision is for a total amount of €952,000. The final cost of the project, which will also include security, hardware, software licences, support and maintenance, etc. is expected to be around €5 million.

The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals.Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, available on the website, www.finance.gov.ie. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.Prior to the introduction of the revised scheme in 2002, there was a scheme for assistant secretaries which was based on 4% of the assistant secretary group pay bill.

The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 allows for the payment of a subvention towards the cost of such care based on a medical and means assessment. The process used in determining a person's eligibility for subvention is set out in the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993.The repayment scheme for charges for publicly funded residential long-term care does not apply to individuals in private nursing homes who pay the full cost of private nursing home care or who have entered these homes under the nursing home subvention scheme.Any person who considers that he or she or a family member may be eligible for repayment may register his or her interest in advance with Health Service Executive, HSE, by writing to the National Refund Scheme, HSE Midland Area, Arden Road, Tullamore, County Offaly; or by e-mail to refundscheme@mailq.hse.ie; or by calling the helpline 1800 777737 during office hours.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	573	The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges for publicly funded residential care. All those fully eligible persons, including those with disability or psychiatric illness who were illegally charged for long stay care in an inpatient setting, will have the charges repaid in full. The estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died more than six years prior to that date. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the consumer price index, since the time the person involved was charged.Legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible to provide a clear legal framework for the scheme. In the case of those who were charged and are still alive, the repayments will be exempt from tax and will not be taken into account in assessing means for health and social welfare benefits. The normal tax and means assessment arrangements will apply to those who benefit from repayments to estates.The legislation will include appropriate safeguards to prevent exploitation of those who receive repayments and are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs. The scheme will include a provision to allow those eligible for a repayment to waive their right to a repayment and have the money assigned to fund one-off service improvements in elderly, mental health and disability services. A national oversight committee has been appointed and has already begun its work. It will provide an independent input into the design of the scheme and will monitor the operation of the scheme in order to ensure that it is being implemented quickly and in the most equitable and effective way possible. The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified under the ex gratia payments process. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process.An outside organisation with experience in handling mass claims will be engaged by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to design and manage the scheme within the parameters of the key principles approved by Government. The company selected will work closely with the HSE to ensure that the necessary co-operation is forthcoming on records held by the health agencies. The HSE has received expressions of interest from a number of companies and these have been short-listed. It is anticipated that the successful organisation will be selected in November and will begin work on the design of the scheme. The national helpline has been set up by the HSE to allow people to register if they believe they are due a repayment. This will continue to operate but there is no need for anyone who has already registered using this facility to make contact with the HSE again to register for the scheme. Figures provided by the HSE up to and including 5 September 2005 indicate that 9,928 people have received payment under the ex gratia scheme. My Department has requested the HSE to provide the further information requested by the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 to 209, inclusive, together.The Deputy's questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004. This includes responsibility for considering new capital proposals or progressing those in the health capital programme. The HSE has made provision to progress the phase 2B development at Mullingar within the health capital investment framework 2005-2009.It was recently decided to fast-track the first phase of the development, which involves the completion of the fit out of the ward accommodation in the shelled out area. The design team is currently preparing detailed drawings with the intention of going to tender in March 2006. With this in mind, a prior indicative notice, PIN, is to be lodged in the EU Journal shortly. Planning permission is also to be sought, and the target completion date for the fit out of the shelled area is early 2007.The first stage of the project, as planned to date, includes the provision of an additional 43 beds, mainly medical and surgical. The design work on the second stage of the project is to continue in parallel with the fit out and equipping of the shelled accommodation project. The second stage will include the provision of the following new facilities: pathology department; operating department; medicine for the elderly — rehabilitation unit; acute psychiatric unit; child and adolescent psychiatric unit; occupational therapy department; administrative accommodation; staff accommodation; education facilities; catering facilities; and new entrance concourse.The second stage of the project as planned to date provides for a further 16 additional beds, mainly for day cases, as well as accommodating the transfer of 50 rehabilitation and acute psychiatric beds from facilities currently located outside the hospital. It has been estimated by the Health Service Executive that additional revenue funding of the order of €10 million, excluding inflation, will be required on an annual basis to run the shelled out area when it is fully fitted out. This estimate reflects a combination of the additional pay and non-pay costs required. Given the significant level of additional annual revenue costs associated with the project, I have asked that an independent review of the estimate be conducted, to ensure that the estimate represents best value for money. The terms of reference for the review are currently being finalised. A steering group will oversee the review and will facilitate access to other health care facilities which the reviewer may consider it necessary to examine. It is intended that the review will be completed prior to the project going to tender as planned and therefore will not delay the project.

Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, available on the website www.finance.gov.ie. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information. The Deputy has sought information dating from 2000. Prior to the introduction of the revised scheme in 2002, there was a scheme for assistant secretaries which was based on 4% of the pay bill for the group of assistant secretaries. Payments made under the above schemes are as follows. In 2001 a total of €21,420.48 was awarded to seven individuals and in 2002 a total of €11,172.00 was awarded to four individuals. The awards paid in 2001 are in respect of two years to 31 April 2001. The awards paid in 2002 are in respect of the eight month period to 31 December 2001.On payments in relation to the EU Presidency, the following payments were made in 2004 and 2005 in respect of consistent and exceptional attendance by principal officers and assistant principal officers, non-overtime grades, in respect of the special extra attendance required in the context of the EU Presidency. A total of €64,383 was paid to 22 officers.

It enables Departments and offices to grant awards to staff and is considered to make a valuable contribution as part of the overall reward and motivation system in the Civil Service.

In relation to Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, I have accepted invitations to attend two meetings hosted by Dr. Conor Burke, consultant respiratory physician at Connolly Memorial Hospital. One was attended by many of the consultants at the hospital, a representative of the hospital's management and its director of nursing, the Secretary General of my Department, an official from the Department of Finance and my special adviser. Among the many topics discussed were the potential for the development of step down beds and a private hospital.The other was attended by Mr. Bernard MacNamara, Mr. Noel Corcoran and my special adviser, Mr. Oliver O'Connor. I listened to a presentation of ideas about step down facilities and a private hospital. I recently made a policy direction to the board of the Health Service Executive in relation to private hospital developments that would free up new public beds. It is for the HSE to implement this policy.

The determination of eligibility of applications for a medical card is a matter by legislation for the HSE. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have the matters concerned investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.In examining applications for medical cards the HSE undertakes an assessment of the income of the applicant, and spouse, if any, after income tax and PRSI have been deducted. Allowances are made, where relevant, in respect of dependants and for reasonable expenses incurred in relation to child care, rent or mortgage and commuting to work. Medical cards may be made available by the HSE where the income guidelines are exceeded in circumstances, for example, where there is heavy demand for medical services.

These reliefs include the tax incentive for hotels. As these are being prepared in the context of forthcoming budgets, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	581	The position is that the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the customer. The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. There is no provision in European VAT law that would allow the application of an exemption from VAT for supplies to old age pensioners.However, under the social welfare code, the household benefits package, which comprises the electricity-gas allowance, telephone allowance and free lifetime television licence is available to people living permanently in the State. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. The package is also available to carers. Customers under the age of 70 who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and live alone or only with certain categories of people may also have an entitlement to the package. For those customers aged between 66 and 69 years and who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment, a means test must be satisfied to determine eligibility for the package.The electricity allowance covers the normal standing charge and up to 1,800 units of electricity each year. At current prices, the value of the electricity allowance to the consumer is approximately €339 per annum for urban dwellers, and €381 for rural dwellers, inclusive of VAT at 13.5%. An electricity group account allowance may be paid if a customer lives in self-contained accommodation and operates an electricity slot meter or where the registered consumer of electricity is the landlord. Payment is made by way of 12 vouchers at an annual value of €360, inclusive of VAT at 13.5%.Alternatively, if the natural gas allowance option is selected, the customer is entitled to the supply charge and up to 1,674 kwh of gas per year. The annual value of this is up to €313 per annum inclusive of VAT at 13.5%. If the person's home is not connected to an electricity or natural gas supply, the person is entitled to 15 cylinders of bottled gas per annum at an annual value of approximately €320 inclusive of VAT at 13.5%.The telephone allowance is paid as a credit on the customer's telephone bill. The value of the allowance is €24.70 per month, including VAT, or €296.40 per annum.

The only relevant data available are estimates of the cost of tax forgone to the Exchequer derived at aggregated level from very tentative estimates of aggregated amounts paid out under pension schemes. The tentative estimates of cost are based on the taxpayer's marginal rate and the figures, which are available for the years 1997 to 2002, the latest available, are as follows:
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Under the initial phase of the decentralisation programme approximately 90,000 sq m of office accommodation will be provided in the regions for staff moving out of Dublin. A broadly equivalent amount of space will as a consequence be vacated in the Dublin area. The approach to the disposal of the space to be vacated in Dublin is under consideration. Ultimately, any decisions on disposals will depend on a range of factors including the particular requirements of the Departments remaining in Dublin; the specific circumstances associated with each building including location, quality and design, tenure, office area and whether its leasehold or freehold; the timing of property disposals as sales are directly affected by the prevailing market conditions; and the timing of the relocation of staff to decentralised offices.The cost of acquiring sites or properties for the early mover Departments is estimated to be in the region of €47 million excluding VAT. Although property solutions will include leasing and fitting out of existing buildings, it is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the accommodation facilities will be provided by the construction of new office buildings and cost estimation can be approached on this basis. However, in advance of market testing of any procurement methodology, it is possible, at this time, only to assign the most general measurements of cost to such a large-scale, diverse and complex programme.Current OPW cost norms in respect of offices would indicate an average build cost to fit out standard in the range of €1,800 to €2,200 per square metre. Such figures exclude VAT, professional fees and inflation. In addition, the cost of equipping the accommodation to standard office equipment levels could be estimated at approximately €4,000 per person. This would exclude the cost of information and communication technology and specialised equipment requirements.Such general measures of cost do not include specialised facility and equipment requirements and other variables, which would arise from the spread of possible procurement methodologies. In addition, general cost indicators of this type show a snapshot in time.It is self-evident that a firmer scale of costs for the decentralisation programme will only emerge on foot of cost proposals being received from the market. It will be some months yet before sufficient data can be extracted from a suitable range of tender competitions to provide a basis on which more robust estimates of the overall cost of the programme can be made. Nevertheless, it can be estimated that, generally speaking, the cost of providing accommodation in provincial, compared to central Dublin, locations should yield considerable cost savings to the State over time in terms of site costs, capital build costs and indeed maintenance costs.

Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. Since 2002, the funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the grades covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% of basic salary can be made to individuals. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, available on the website www.finance.gov.ie. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.

It provides that 1% of payroll for these grades be made available in the form of special service payments, for which staff are invited to apply, based on the following criteria: contribution by the individual to the work of the Department in his or her job; special demands of the job; and experience brought to the job. Initial special service payments were effective from 2000 and were paid out in 2002 along with the 2001 payments.

This percentage was revised to 0.2% in 1998.An independent committee administers the merit awards scheme up to AO-HEO level; an assistant secretary group administers the awards at assistant principal and principal level. Nominees for the annual merit awards must, during the year, have demonstrated one or more of the following criteria: given an exceptional performance in some aspect of his or her work; demonstrated unusual commitment and dedication to some aspect of his or her work; or made a notable contribution to the successful achievement of the section's targets.The following are the details of payment in respect of each of merit awards in each year since 2000.20002001200220032004Total amount£20,071£13,250€38,302€42,652€44,720Highest amount£700£360€1,270€750€800Following an analysis of staff attrition rates in IT areas in the Civil Service and their adverse impact on achieving year 2000 compliance, agreement was reached at general council to payment of a once off loyalty bonus to key IT staff on year 2000 work.

Decisions in relation to VFM issues arising from ICT investments in other bodies are the responsibility of the relevant parent Departments and this was the case with the Department of Health and the health sector prior to the setting up of the HSE.As part of these arrangements and following a meeting at the beginning of June in relation to the PPARS project, my Department requested the HSE through the Department of Health and Children to consider the FISP project in light of the discussion regarding PPARS. A follow-up meeting on the FISP project was arranged by my Department on 9 September and following this, a briefing document was sent to me for information on 13 September in relation to the still outstanding concerns. The HSE was then conducting an initial review which led to Professor Drumm, the CEO of the HSE, putting a hold on the further rollout shortly thereafter.As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE have since decided to pause the rollout of the PPARS implementation and to review both the PPARS and the FISP project. I believe this to be the right approach given all the circumstances and the amount of money involved. I expect recommendations will arise from the review in relation to the future of both of these systems. I can confirm that my officials have had discussions with officials in the Department of Health and Children on this and related issues.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The Centre for Management Organisation and Development, CMOD, is part of the organisation management and training division of the Department of Finance. Its function is to provide a number of advisory land support services to the Civil Service in the areas of information technology, staff development and management, and organisation systems development. It aims to support and improve public service management which includes, inter alia, the improved management of resources and ensuring Departments and offices achieve better value for money in the development of human resource management, financial management, e-Government initiatives and information management generally.As the computing needs of organisations across the Civil Service differ widely, responsibility for the delivery of most computing services rests with each organisation. In this regard, individual organisations operate under a delegated arrangement which incorporates a number of centrally imposed controls and constraints such as: compliance with standard governance and technical principles; the use of project boards and formal project management techniques in their internal ICT projects; compliance with competitive procurement procedures; use of common infrastructures and systems; and accessing common central procurements, where applicable etc.In operating the delegation arrangements, Departments and offices are required to submit a broad value for money justification for each of their major ICT project proposals. This justification has to receive my Department's approval prior to any commencement. The delegation arrangements also require Departments and offices to report on an annual basis their progress in relation to projects in the previous year.CMOD retains a number of computing functions where they are substantially common to all Departments-offices, for example, HR and payroll, or where bulk purchasing advantages arise from common procurements, for example, telecommunications services. Accordingly, CMOD has no direct responsibility for acquiring or managing consultants other than for projects that it is managing itself, that is, for cross-departmental systems such as HR and payroll and for telecommunication services.CMOD's full complement of staff is 96. The annual cost for CMOD as a whole is €7.5 million. CMOD provides advice and guidance on a range of IT projects and across a whole range of IT issues from telecommunications to maintenance and it is not possible to indicate the specific costs of projects for which advice is given.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I am aware of the situation that has arisen in relation to industrial relations issues at An Post and in particular to the non-payment of Sustaining Progress increases to the company's pensioners and employees. I point out, however, that I have no function in directing An Post in the matter of operational and commercial issues such as the application of national pay awards.As a commercial company, the challenge ahead for An Post is to develop a strategy that satisfies the needs of existing customers, while attracting new customers. An Post has a remit to be financially viable and following significant losses, which amounted to €43 million in 2003 alone, An Post management invoked the "inability to pay" clause provided for in Sustaining Progress. Therefore, the key challenge for the company is to return to long-term financial stability. An agreement on a viable recovery plan is the only way forward for An Post to deliver quality services to our citizens, while at the same time providing sustainable well-paid employment for its staff.Change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future. With this in mind, the board and management of An Post have presented a recovery plan, incorporating details of a proposed new collection and delivery service, which I believe is vital to the re-establishment of the company on a more secure financial footing. The plan sets out the way forward for the company. Adoption of the restructuring that, as envisaged by the plan, delivers real change is the only way An Post workers and pensioners can look forward to receiving pay increases in line with other sectors. I have continuously emphasised the need for all stakeholders in the company to work together in a partnership approach and to utilise the industrial relations mechanisms of the State, where necessary, in order to agree and implement the recovery strategy to return the company to financial stability and prepare for the challenges ahead.In order to progress the change agenda, an exhaustive process of negotiation between An Post management and An Post trade unions, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and then the Labour Court, was entered into, which has lasted almost two years. To progress the change agenda, An Post unions and management were involved in intensive negotiations with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery in a bid to agree a recovery plan that will put the company on a sound footing. This process has lasted almost two years.The question of Sustaining Progress related payments to employees and pensioners was addressed in a Labour Relations Commission, LRC, brokered process. Assessors, appointed by the LRC, recommended that An Post was in a position to pay a 5% increase to its employees and pensioners. This increase, backdated to 1 January 2005, was paid to An Post employees and pensioners at the end of June 2005.In order to meet union concerns, a three-person expert group was formed under the auspices of the Labour Court to devise a workable agreement on collection and delivery. The process at the Labour Court recently concluded with the court's recommendation that the company accept the proposals as set out by the three-person, court-appointed technical group's report on An Post's collection and delivery arrangements and that upon ratification by both parties of the draft agreement annexed to that recommendation, the company should arrange for payment of all 2005 and future increases due under Sustaining Progress to its employees and pensioners. The court further recommended that all retrospective payments relating to the recent 5% increase paid by An Post, be made to its employees and pensioners as soon as the company is returned to reasonable and sustainable profit and when commercial circumstances permit. I understand, however, that on 5 September 2005, the Labour Court's recommendations on the issues of Sustaining Progress and collection and delivery were rejected by the main union in An Post, the Communications Workers Union, with the result that the company is not in a position to make any further increases to its employees or pensioners.I would like to take this opportunity to echo the Taoiseach's comments in the Chamber last week and restate that industrial action in An Post would only deepen the problems and put jobs and living standards of the company's employees and pensioners at risk and I, too, urge members of the CWU to consider very carefully the options before them. It is my understanding that, following a special delegate conference, the union has now decided to ballot its membership for industrial action up to and including strike action. The ballot will be concluded by Friday, 21 October.

Within the ESIOP a sustainable energy priority was agreed with part funding from the European regional development fund, ERDF, and co-funding from Exchequer or other national sources.The conditions agreed between the State and the EU require expenditure to be undertaken within two years of the original projection or the loss of the relevant ERDF moneys. This is referred to as the "N+2" rule. An amount of flexibility is built into this rule and the national management authority can transfer funding from one priority or spending subhead to another with the agreement of the EU and stakeholders.The sustainable energy priority comprises two measures dealing with energy conservation and with alternative energy. Energy conservation is on target to deliver its investment. The major part of the second measure is the grid upgrade development programme, GUDP, which was intended to fund the capital intensive portion of planned connections, thereby ensuring projects did not fail due to the high capital cost of a connection offer.Getting new renewable energy powered electricity generating plants connected has been a slower and more difficult task than was foreseen when the GUDP was put in place. In December 2003, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, authorised a moratorium on new connection offers to new undispatchable plants due to concerns about overall system stability of the electricity network. This decision and subsequent decisions of the network operators meant, in effect, that no new connection offers for renewable energy powered plants were confirmed between December 2003 and early 2005.A consequence of an absence of new connection offers in this period was that the GUDP could not be activated to fund the shared connection asset element of any such confirmed connection offer. Nevertheless, the installed capacity is approximately 400 megawatts-equivalent, MWe, now and is expected to reach 600 MWe under the current support programme.The slower than expected delivery of connections following the moratorium and subsequent decisions of the network operators has made it prudent to reallocate €5 million from this support measure this year to avoid Ireland's losing the benefit of these structural funds under the "N+2" rule. However, the GUDP has recommenced and based on identified demand for projects with a firm or planned connection offer, its purpose and effect will not be in any way be diminished by this reallocation. The plan is that as connecting parties are charged for access to the shared asset that funding will be reinvested in further projects.

Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these social benefits.The An Post network comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country. In the European context, Ireland still has the highest number of post offices per head of population. In recent years some network restructuring has been undertaken. This activity is in line with similar trends across Europe. Specifically, in relation to the closure of post offices or sub-post offices, it is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found or where there are no applicants that a post office is closed.It is the Government's objective to maintain the largest, economically sustainable post office network possible. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size. While the Government will support the network in any way it can and has demonstrated its commitment in a tangible fashion, with a €12.7 million capital injection in 2003, the way forward is for An Post to enhance existing services and, building on existing strengths, develop new product offerings.The network has a high footfall and to capitalise on these advantages it is essential that existing and new services are developed to meet customer requirements. The network also has the capacity and potential to deliver more private business, especially in financial services, and opportunities are actively being pursued by An Post in this area. On foot of substantial investment in computerisation, a significant amount of extra business has already been obtained for the network in terms of banking and utility business. At present, 95% of An Post's business is conducted through automated offices. Also under way is a new pilot scheme to automate a total of ten smaller post offices. This will allow the company to determine to what extent, if any, further investment in automation might be justified. The results of this project will be evaluated at the end of the trial period.I have also asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network and in this light, An Post is currently working on a new initiative which could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.

There will continue to be a key national role for An Post, both in the delivery of mail and as a quality service provider through its nationwide network of post office outlets. The market for traditional postal and post office services is changing globally, and meeting customer needs has become more important than ever. To remain competitive, An Post must make the best possible use of its long-established and trusted brand name and deploy its resources in a manner that continues to serve existing customers' needs and attracts additional customers for a range of new services.There is agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and continue to offer a top-class nationwide delivery service to the customer.

In addition, a pilot project is under way that involves the automation of ten small post offices.In light of the need to ensure the long-term viability of the network, An Post is currently working on a new initiative that would see the development of An Post financial services, APFS. Its aim is to supply a wide range of retail financial services through the branch network. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business.

The transmission system operators are currently working on phase 1 of the project, including technical issues and route selection. That phase is likely to be completed by early 2007. Phase 2, the construction phase, will then commence, and it is estimated that the interconnector will be operational by 2012. The proposed interconnector will provide increased system security and reliability. It will be a positive step toward further developing competition and will facilitate the development of a fully functioning single electricity market.Regarding the east-west electricity interconnector, the CER has appointed consultants to advise on the financial, technical, commercial and procurement aspects of the development. Phase 1 of the project, which is nearing completion, is examining procurement options, routing, capacity, ownership and operational parameters.A consultation process has been undertaken with all parties who have expressed an interest. A decision on how best to take the project forward, whether on a regulated or a hybrid regulated or merchant basis, is the next step, and such determination will be informed by the advice of the CER in the matter.With regard to gas interconnection, the two natural gas interconnectors with the UK, IC1 and IC2, have been operational since 1995 and 2003, respectively. As part of the development of the gas network on an all-island basis, the South-North pipeline, due for completion in 2006, will carry gas to Belfast from the IC2 landfall at Gormanston.

This priority is shared by EU institutions through the renewables directive, Directive 2001/77/EC, which obliges all member states to increase the consumption of green electricity by 2010. The obligation addressed to Ireland is to deliver a programme capable of increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010.The target of 13.2% approximates to 1,400 MW to be connected to the electricity network by 2010. It is acknowledged at EU level as a challenging target which will require us to more than double existing capacity within five years. This is the minimum target I demand. My overall target is to optimise the amount of renewable energy technologies which can be connected to the network while maintaining safe and reliable supply and reasonable retail charges for consumers.Future challenging targets to increase wind powered stations will require co-operation and co-ordination between my Department; Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI; the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER; the electricity networks operators; and developers. I am pleased to report that all these key players, and more, have participated in a consultation process launched in December 2003 and in the work of the subsequently established renewable energy development group. The group's report will form the basis of my future policy decisions on the increased penetration of renewable energy technologies in the electricity market and will seek to ensure developers can make a reasonable rate of return on renewable energy projects while ensuring the interests of national competitiveness and the ultimate burden of cost to the final consumer are all fully taken into consideration.I recently announced a new support mechanism to be known as the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT. This revised system will move away from competitive tendering to a fixed price proposal. In addition, the support that was previously tied to contracts with the ESB will now be available for supply contracts with any licensed supplier. The detailed draft terms and conditions of the proposed feed-in support programme were posted on my Department's website, www.dcmnr.gov.ie, in draft form, on 29 September and interested parties have until today to raise any queries or to furnish any observations on the proposals as published. Following consideration of the matters raised, the REFIT programme will be put in place.In July, my Northern counterpart, Ms Angela Smith, and I published a preliminary consultation paper on an all-island vision for renewable energy to the year 2020 and beyond. The consultation period recently ended and the response has been encouraging. The aim is to develop a long-term strategy for renewable energy on the island in its entirety.

I am committed to the development and promotion of a biofuels and bio-energy sector in Ireland's transport, domestic and industrial fuel markets, which will contribute to emissions reductions and overall security of supply.In 2004, my Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which provides for the introduction of a scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels. A scheme under the Act was agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance and was launched in April 2005. The proposals were evaluated by my Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, and recommendations were made to the Minister for Finance. As a result, eight projects were awarded excise relief under the scheme, including four pure plant oil, three biodiesel or other biofuel, and one bioethanol proposal. Excise relief of €6 million will be allowed for these projects over a two-year period to 2007. It is anticipated that this will result in 16 million litres of biofuels being placed on the Irish transport market during that period. The scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development.Under SEI's renewable energy research, development and demonstration, RERD&D, programme, capital grant aid is also available for biofuels market demonstration projects in the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories. Funding of almost €250,000 has already been awarded to support engine modifications in up to 100 vehicles and provide plant and monitoring equipment.In addition, SEI has provided grant aid of €40,000 to Teagasc for a study to establish oil quality testing procedures for pure plant oil. This study will be critical to building market confidence. SEI has also provided funding for the publication of a resource study on recovered vegetable oil and animal fats and a study on quality assurance for rapeseed oil as a vehicle fuel.An interdepartmental biofuels group was established in 2004 to consider policy options for the development of the biofuels market and to consider these options from the perspectives of the sectors or interests represented by each Department. It comprises representatives from my Department, the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Finance, Transport, Agriculture and Food and SEI. As part of its work, the group commissioned a liquid biofuels strategy study for Ireland, which was published by SEI in December 2004. The report examines the full range of options and potential supports for liquid biofuels development in Ireland, including bioethanol and biodiesel.The number of applications in the pilot scheme clearly indicates the strong interest there is in developing a biofuels industry. I have been in contact with the Minister for Finance about the possible scope for scaling up fiscal support for biofuels. Further measures to increase market penetration over a longer timeframe are also being considered in consultation with all the relevant Departments.In addition to the ongoing developments in respect of liquid biofuels, in December 2003, my Department established a bio-energy strategy group to make recommendations on policy options for the development of bio-energy in Ireland. The group comprised representatives of my Department, SEI, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, COFORD, Teagasc, and industry representatives. In parallel with this development, my Department launched a consultation process on options for renewable energy support and established a renewable energy development group, REDG. The findings of the bio-energy strategy group are being considered by the REDG in the context of overall policy recommendations.SEI has supported a number of biomass facilities to date and the biomass sector has attracted the largest amount of support under SEI's renewable energy research, development and demonstration, RERD&D, programme. Among the specific projects addressed to date are funding of €732,000 towards a combined heat and power system, using sawmill residues at Grainger sawmill in Cork. The plant is designed to generate both 1.83 MW electrical energy and 3.5 MW of thermal energy in a single process. Funding of €91,626 has been made towards a 100 kW capacity wood chip-wood pellet biomass boiler at the headquarters of the State forestry company, Coillte. Coillte recently relocated its corporate headquarters to a 100% sustainable, timber-constructed building. The cost and installation of the boiler, including automatic fuel supply auger, amounted to €27,500.The remaining support from SEI is provided for the solar heating system, monitoring programme and the energy centre. The solar and wood heating systems are located in a purpose-built energy centre that is open to the public. Funding of €40,000 has been made towards the provision of a 500 kW wood boiler and solar panels at Inchydoney Lodge and Spa Hotel in Clonakilty, County Cork. Funding of €18,000 has been made towards the provision of a 100 kW wood chip boiler at Camphill Community, Jerpoint, County Kilkenny.In addition to the RERD&D programme, SEI's house of tomorrow programme has committed over €7.5 million funding covering 39 projects and a total of 1,818 housing units. The scheme encourages housing developers to incorporate design and technology packages for high standard energy and CO2 performance. The range of technologies in these packages included wood pellet boilers that have been installed in 93 homes.The SEI renewable energy information office also provides a free information service on wood heating. A free video-DVD on bio-energy, including wood heating and procurement guidelines for installers and others, is being made available as part of this initiative. SEI is also developing training courses for renewable energy installers, as part of a joint initiative with Action Renewables in Northern Ireland. The first of these courses, which will include training for the installation of biomass boilers, is scheduled to be available in 2006. The targets achievable for biofuel and bio-energy production and distribution in Ireland depend on a variety of factors including availability and end-use of agricultural land and the levels of indigenously sourced or imported feedstock or biofuels.

This consists of 400 MW of wind and 240 MW of hydro with the balance made up of different biomass technologies. Further development will also take place from the last two rounds of competitive tendering, the AER V and AER VI competitions.Ireland has a renewable electricity target of 13.2% of electricity consumption to be sourced from renewable technologies by 2010. To meet this target, we need in the region of 1,450 MW of renewable capacity connected. This means some 400 MW of new renewable capacity must be constructed. Accordingly, I recently announced a new fixed feed-in tariff support programme for new renewable energy electricity generating plant. This programme will support 400 MW and the figure will be increased to accommodate any slippage rates from previous competitions.In July, my Northern counterpart, Ms Angela Smith, and I published a preliminary consultation paper on an all-island vision for renewable energy to the year 2020 and beyond.

The possibilities for carrying out illegal activity via any medium are infinite. Much of the criminal activity perpetrated using electronic communications networks is legislated for according to the offence and not the medium by which it was committed. Some such legislation predates the advent of electronic technology. Legislating to combat these offences does not always fall within my remit, nor in these instances are they the responsibility of ComReg.It is an offence under section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951, as amended by the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, to send by telephone any message or other matter which is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character.

An Post plays a key role both in delivery of mails and as a quality service provider through its nationwide network of post office outlets. However, there is universal agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top-class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future.With this in mind, the board and management of An Post have presented a recovery plan which is vital to the re-establishment of the company on a more secure financial footing. The plan has assumed significant changes in work practices, tariff increases and the payment of wage increases, and sets out the way forward for the company. In order to progress the change agenda, I have met with representatives of An Post management and unions on several occasions over the past 12 months. I have listened with interest to the views of all parties concerned in regard to the future of the network. I have emphasised to all parties the importance of an early start to the company's modernisation and that both sides must engage directly in order to resolve long-standing and deep-seated problems besetting the company.On the matter of retention of the maximum number of post offices and sub-post offices, the Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network as set out in the programme for Government. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these social benefits. The An Post network comprises the single largest number of retail outlets in the country and, in the European context, Ireland still has the highest number of post offices per head of population.Additionally, in light of the need to ensure the long-term viability of the network, An Post is working on a new initiative which could see the development and delivery of a wide range of retail financial services through the branch network. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business. An Post has initiated a process to seek a joint venture partner for this new initiative.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The national development plan proposed expenditure of €52.01 million under the coast protection measure in the period 2000 to 2006. However actual expenditure is dependent on the allocation of funding under the annual Estimates provision. Up to the end of June 2005 a total of €32.275 million was spent on coast protection. The allocation to the Department for expenditure in 2006 on coast protection is still to be determined.A value for money report in March 2002 highlighted the need for a more strategic focus in addressing the problem of coastal erosion in Ireland. In the light of this the Department initiated a coast protection strategy study in 2003. The study addresses the nature and extent of erosion at various locations and different types of coastline in Ireland and seeks to identify the most effective means, technically, financially and environmentally, in responding to particular instances and types of erosion. The pilot phase of this study is scheduled to be completed in spring 2006. The question of providing funding for coast protection works in the future will depend on the outcome of the coastal protection strategy study, the amount of Exchequer funding available for such works and overall national priorities.

As the complaint concerns drift net fishing in Irish waters, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is continuing to work very closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the drafting of a reply to the European Commission's preliminary complaint against Ireland. The reply is required to be submitted by 13 November 2005.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I propose to take Questions Nos. 290 to 292, inclusive, together.Since taking up my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have reaffirmed the Government's acceptance of the scientific advice that reductions in the overall fishing effort are required in order to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide. For this reason, current Government policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement up to the level of the scientifically advised conservation limits as soon as possible. In keeping with this policy, when setting the commercial salmon quotas for the 2005 season, I gave a firm commitment to fully align the exploitation of salmon, both at national and district levels, on the scientific advice by 2007.In order to achieve this, I have asked the new National Salmon Commission to advise as to how best the alignment of exploitation of salmon with the scientific advice can be implemented by 2007, bearing in mind the requirement to ensure the future biological viability of the salmon resource in all catchments and also the needs of all stakeholders, including those who derive their living from the wild salmon resource.In undertaking its remit, the National Salmon Commission will be required to consider what conservation management mechanisms may be required to achieve the alignment of national and district total allowable catches with the scientific advice given to it by the standing scientific committee. Scientific advice on Irish salmon stocks is based on International Council for the Exploration of the Seas recommendations. The full terms of reference which I have assigned to the National Salmon Commission are provided for in the National Salmon Commission (Terms of Reference) Order 2005 (SI No. 627 of 2005).
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I understand that the North Atlantic Salmon Fund, NASF, is a private, non-governmental organisation. The Irish Government does not contribute to the financial operation of the organisation nor am I aware that any other national Government contributes towards the set aside of the West Greenland salmon fisheries. I am advised that the compensation provided by NASF for the Faroese set aside expired at least five years ago.

Of this total, €8.8 million is already provided for under the current national development plan which runs to 2006, of which 75%, €6.6 million, is funded from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance with the remaining 25%, €2.2 million, being met through matching Exchequer funding. The future mechanism for EU funding post 2006 has yet to be finalised at EU level.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	612	The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the independent regulator.It has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband, so my Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These metropolitan area networks, MANs, will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.Nineteen MANs are now completed and a further seven are nearing completion. The second phase of the programme involves the building of MANs in a further 93 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the sector. Kildare is developing projects in respect of the following towns: Kildare, Newbridge, Rathangan, Sallins, Maynooth, Clane, Monasterevin, Kilcock and Prosperous. The route designs are being finalised prior to issuing the detailed design invitation to tender. Construction on these projects is expected to commence in early 2006.For rural communities and the hinterlands of larger towns such as Athy, my Department offers funding under the county and group broadband scheme to enable these communities to become self-sufficient in broadband, in association with the service providers. To date the following schemes have been approved for Kildare county: Cloncurry, Balraheen, Timahoe, Kilcock rural area, Clane rural area, Drehid, Dunfierth, Cadamstown and Donadee, making broadband available to over 7,927 people. Full details of the scheme, including application procedures, are on the website www.gbs.gov.ie.
My Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie lists all service providers offering broadband services in all towns in Kildare, and gives contact details for each company, together with prices for the various service levels on offer.

While I accept that previous indications were that I expected to publish the report before now, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that given the complexity of the issues involved, it was important that the Department had sufficient time to adequately consider the report and its findings and to develop a suitable strategy for the implementation of its recommendations, if accepted by Government.It is my intention, however, to bring this report to Government in the very near future and to have it published as soon as possible thereafter. Until such time as the report is presented to Government, I am not in a position to comment on its recommendations or implementation.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	615	As a member of the International Energy Agency, Ireland is obliged to maintain oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports. The oil industry here is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated. The industry sources its supplies on a commercial basis from overseas suppliers. Oil prices in Ireland are not controlled and as Minister I have no function with regard to oil prices, which are a matter for the market.As regards ensuring the continuity and security of natural gas supplies, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has responsibility for monitoring the security of natural gas supplies on an ongoing basis. The commission publishes annually a rolling seven-year gas capacity statement. This provides a forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand to assess the adequacy of the Irish gas transmission system.The gas capacity statement also considers whether projected supplies of gas from indigenous sources, imports and storage are sufficient to meet forecast demand. A key finding of the 2005 gas capacity statement is that even under unusually cold weather conditions, the Irish gas transmission system will cope with forecast demand.As regards the production of clean energy, in 2004, my Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which provides for the introduction of a scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels. A scheme under the Act was launched in April 2005 and eight projects were subsequently awarded excise relief valued at €6 million over a two-year period to 2007. It is anticipated that this will result in 16 million litres of biofuels being placed on the Irish transport market during that period. The scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development.The number of applications in the pilot scheme clearly indicates the strong interest there is in developing a biofuels industry in Ireland. I have had contact with the Minister for Finance about the possible scope for scaling up fiscal support for biofuels. Further measures to increase market penetration over a longer timeframe are also being considered in consultation with all of the relevant Departments.Under Sustainable Energy Ireland's, SEI, renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme, capital grant aid is also available for biofuels market demonstration projects in the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories. Funding of almost €250,000 has already been awarded to support engine modifications of up to 100 vehicles and provide plant and monitoring equipment.An interdepartmental biofuels group was established in 2004 to consider policy options for the development of the biofuels market. It comprises representatives from my Department, as well as the Dsepartment of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Finance, Transport and Agriculture and Food, and SEI. As part of its work, the group commissioned a report entitled A Liquid Biofuels Strategy Study for Ireland, which was published by SEI in December 2004. The report examines the full range of options and potential supports for liquid biofuels development in Ireland, including bioethanol and biodiesel.SEI has supported a number of biomass facilities to date. SEI's house of tomorrow programme has committed over €7.5 million in funding to 39 projects and a total of 1,818 housing units. The scheme encourages housing developers to incorporate design and technology packages for high standard energy and CO2 performance. The range of technologies included in these packages included wood pellet boilers that have been installed in 93 homes.In so far as the regime in respect of oil, gas and other mineral exploration is concerned, as part of the commitments in the programme for Government, I intend to bring forward proposals for a new minerals development Bill to consolidate and update legislation, enacted between 1940 and 1999, regulating the non-petroleum minerals sector. Work is under way on this in my Department.I also intend to bring forward Bills to update the legislation governing petroleum exploration and development, namely the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, and the Continental Shelf Act 1968. This work is also under way.The terms governing petroleum exploration and development are kept under constant review by my Department. These terms are attractive by international standards and are designed to encourage offshore exploration. I have no immediate plans to reform the terms at this time.Exploration and development of minerals is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999. All extraction of minerals under the Acts is subject to payment of royalties to the State. While it is my intention to consolidate and update those Acts in a new minerals development Bill currently in preparation, I do not propose to change that policy.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	619	The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for two Votes — Vote 28, Foreign Affairs, and Vote 29, International Co-operation. The Department commissions consultancies where specialised knowledge and-or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of the Development Co-operation Ireland, DCI, programme, where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. The awarding of the contracts referred to below is done at official level and I have had no personal involvement in the process.The information requested by the Deputy for Vote 28 is set out in table A below. The Deputy may wish to note that the majority of expenditure on consultancies for 2002 to 2005 relates to the upgrading of the Department's information technology infrastructure at headquarters and in our missions abroad, and to the development of an automated passport production system, APS.The upgrading of the Department's information technology infrastructure commenced in 2002 and covered a broad range of technologies that required specialised expertise in a number of areas. No fixed contract was agreed with a single supplier. Instead, rates were agreed for specialised expertise with several suppliers and these were utilised on a draw down basis, as and when required. The spending in this area came in under budget in each of the years in question.The automated passport production system, APS, was essential to meet demands for passports in an efficient and effective manner and to comply with new international security regulations. It has delivered, to quote the United States authorities, a superb product. Costs associated with the APS are contained in years 2001-05. The actual contract price for the APS system was budgeted at €21.8 million in December 2002. However, during the implementation of the contract, the Department saw the need for further additions to the project and the final outcome for non-recurrent costs was €27.7 million. The APS project is primarily procurement and delivery of service rather than consultancy in the narrow sense. BearingPoint were the main contractors for the APS project and, as such, had responsibility for the supply of hardware, software, design solutions and development. These costs are all included in the figures provided.A daily rate, based on salary scales at retirement, was agreed with a small number of former officers of this Department who acted on behalf of the Department on international bodies. A daily rate was also agreed with those who provided specialised legal advice.In 2003 and 2004, payments relating to the EU Presidency website were made to Labyrinth and Amas. Also during this period, payments were made to Red Dog Design for the design of the EU Presidency logo, the branding of the Presidency and other project management costs for campaigns to promote regional awareness of the Presidency and to promote the associated website. These payments also included ancillary production charges covering printing, display units and backdrops, etc. The final outturn costs reflected a combination of the agreed tender fee, together with the volume of services and supplies provided.The information relating to Vote 29 is set out in table B below. DCI consultancies cover a wide range of sectors including HIV-AIDS, education, health and rural development. A high proportion of the contracts under Vote 29 concern the monitoring, review and evaluation of development programmes and projects commissioned at headquarters to ensure quality and value for money. These contracts are almost always based on a daily rate of payment with a maximum number of days stipulated in the contract. Tight limits on necessary subsistence and travel expenses are also set out in the contract so that the total payments made reflect the original agreed cost. There can be minor variations in travel and subsistence costs.In addition to the HQ commissioned contracts, our aid missions in Africa use locally based consultants from time to time to evaluate aspects of the programme in the field. Details of these contracts are being assembled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.CompanyService ProvidedOriginal EstimateActual Cost(€)(€)RITSICT security services to assist

The Irish Ambassador to Mexico is also accredited to Cuba.The opening of Irish missions abroad and the appointment of resident ambassadors is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. As the Deputy will appreciate, constraints on Government expenditure and limited resources mean that any expansion of our diplomatic network can only be undertaken on a phased basis, and also on a basis of clear priorities.While we welcome the appointment of the Ambassador of the Republic of Cuba to Ireland, there are no plans to change the status of our representation in Cuba at this time.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	621	Under the terms of the Local Government Act 2001, the decision to twin a local authority area, or part of a local authority area, is a decision for the elected members of that authority. The Department of Foreign Affairs does not have any formal role in town or area twinning and no specific funding has been allocated by the Department for such programmes.Our missions abroad do, from time to time, participate in events related to town and area twinning through hosting or attending functions and mission staff are available to provide practical support and advice. For example, the Irish Embassy in Rome made a cultural promotion grant of €3,000 this year to assist an Italian publication entitled Casa Italia: Gemellagi tra Italiae Irlanda concerning twinnings between Ireland and Italy.The Deputy may also wish to note that funding was made available by Development Co-operation Ireland to "Partnerships Ireland Africa", a County Mayo-based organisation supporting partnerships between communities in the west of Ireland and Africa. This funding amounted to €10,000 in 2000, €13,500 in 2001, €2,500 in 2002 and €2,650 in 2003.In regard to the EU dimension, the Institute for Public Administration, IPA, functions as Ireland's national contact point for twinning on behalf of the European Commission. Further details on twinning can be found on the IPA's website www.ipa.ie.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I, personally, do not have any hand, act or part in the process or decision in the above-mentioned matter. This is a matter for the accounting officer of my Department.Two schemes involving annual performance-related pay and biannual merit awards are in operation in the Department of Foreign Affairs. These are the scheme of performance-related pay awards for officers at the level of deputy secretary and assistant secretary, and the merit awards scheme, the details of which are outlined below and in the table which follows.A number of once-off merit awards have also been granted during this period. A recent case involved the recognition of exceptional levels of extra attendance by officers in non-overtime grades in the lead-up to and during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2004. Another, in 2002, related to Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council in 2001 and 2002. Details of such once-off expenditure are also given in the table. With some exceptions, for example, where gift vouchers below a certain value threshold rather than money are given, statutory deductions, including income tax, are made in the normal way.Regarding scheme of performance-related pay awards for officers at the level of deputy secretary and assistant secretary, Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary have been, since 2002, covered by a scheme of performance related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, which are available on the website www.finance.gov.ie.The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information. Prior to the introduction of the revised scheme in 2002 there was a scheme for assistant secretaries which was based on 4% of the pay bill for the assistant secretary grade. Details of the payments under this scheme are also included in the table for the relevant period.Regarding the merit awards scheme, under the Department's administrative budget agreement with the Department of Finance, a fund amounting to 0.2% of the Department's salaries budget is available each year to the Secretary General in respect of ex gratia payments or other awards to individual staff members or groups of staff by way of recognition of exceptional performance of duty. This scheme is administered by a sub-group of the Department’s partnership committee, which assesses nominations for merit awards and makes recommendations to the Secretary General. The objective of the scheme is to reward cases of genuinely exceptional performance by officers in grades up to and including counsellor/principal officer level. Particular attention is paid by the sub-group to the grades of nominees and to the nature and quality of the activities described in the written nominations.Details of all performance-related pay and merit awards made in the period 2000 to 2005 to date are given in the table below. I am of the view that it would be inappropriate to publicise the names of the recipients of the highest awards. I have, however, indicated the grades of the officers concerned.Category and purposeTotal expendedHighest awardGrade of recipient of highest award€€Merit awards scheme24,632.923,967.93Higher Executive OfficerOld scheme of performance-related awards for posts at the level of Assistant Secretary (relating to the period 1 May 1999 to 30 April 2000)126,973.808,253.30Assistant Secretary (10)Category and purposeTotal expendedHighest awardGrade of recipient of highest award€€Merit awards scheme8,532.64406.32First Secretary (2)Executive Officer (4)Clerical Officer (7)Local staff (8)Old scheme of performance-related awards for posts at the level of Assistant Secretary (relating to the period 1 May 2000 to 30 April 2001)156,114.299,523.04Assistant Secretary (10)Category and purposeTotal expendedHighest awardGrade of recipient of highest award€€Merit awards scheme31,600500Counsellor (1)First Secretary (3)Higher Executive Officer (4)Third Secretary (2)Clerical Officer (15)Specialist (1)Local staff (20)Special payments to 9 officers assigned to the Irish Permanent Mission to the UN in New York during Ireland’s two-year term of office on the UN Security Council from 2001 to 2002, in recognition of the exceptionally long hours worked by officers in non-overtime grades47,0007,500CounsellorOld scheme of performance-related awards for posts at the level of Assistant Secretary (relating to the period 1 May to 31 December 2001)107,292.878,253.30Assistant Secretary (4)Once-off merit awards in recognition of the exceptional dedication to duty of the two officers concerned6,0003,000Clerical Officer (2)Category and purposeTotal expendedHighest awardGrade of recipient of highest award€€Merit awards scheme30,650750Clerical Officer (1)Local staff member (1)New scheme of performance-related awards for posts at the level of Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary (relating to 2002)473,78020,655Deputy SecretaryCategory and purposeTotal expendedHighest awardGrade of recipient of highest award€€Merit awards scheme (including some exceptional EU Presidency-related awards)226,2004,000Counsellor (5)New scheme of performance-related awards for posts at the level of Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary (relating to 2003)473,34821,420Deputy SecretaryExceptional performance awards relating to the lead-up to and the period of the Irish EU Presidency in the first half of 2004, in recognition of the exceptionally long hours worked by officers in non-overtime grades789,4775,000Counsellors/POs (52)Category and purposeTotal expendedHighest awardGrade of recipient of highest award€€Merit awards scheme66,9001,000Counsellor (3)First Secretary (2)Third Secretary (3)Assistant Principal Officer (1)Executive Officer (2)Clerical Officer (2)Temporary Clerical Officer (1)New scheme of performance-related awards for posts at the level of Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary (relating to 2004)519,53026,200Deputy SecretaryOnce-off merit award in recognition of the exceptional dedication to duty of the officer concerned4,0004,000Clerical OfficerOnce-off merit awards in recognition of the exceptional performance of certain staff assigned to manage the introduction of a new passport production and issuing system80,3505,000Counsellor (1) Principal Officer (1)

The maximum funding is subject to a ceiling of 0.2% of the annual payroll provision. The scheme was agreed through my Department's partnership process and awards are made on the basis of criteria, terms and conditions set out in the scheme.

Applications for renewals should be submitted to my Department eight weeks before the expiry date of the current permit.

The following tabular statement sets out the jobs lost in IDA supported companies in Kerry for each of the years between 2000 and 2004. Job creation and job losses are a feature of economic development in all countries as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change.The FDI operating environment has changed in recent years, with investors no longer seeing Ireland as a prime location for what might be called low cost, low skill, basic manufacturing and services type activities. Consequently, the primary requirement now is for FDI that is higher value-added, requiring high skill levels, and FDI that is, as far as possible, innovation rather than production orientated and that links to an increasingly sophisticated business environment.Only economic activities with these characteristics can justify high wage levels and so allow Ireland to maintain economic growth in the absence of the strong labour surplus this country had up until recently. This higher-level FDI will contribute more to growth by increasing value-added and integrate better into the host economy because of its greater complexity.IDA Ireland has informed me that it is actively seeking to win new projects for Kerry in more advanced, higher value activities, in both manufacturing and services. In addition to its ongoing marketing of the county to potential new investors it is also actively seeking to facilitate a progression in the sophistication and breadth of its existing clients' Irish operations. This means not only increasing value-added in client manufacturing operations, but also adding corporate level innovation, such as research and development, and service, logistics and supply chain management functions alongside manufacturing.The objective is to create more rounded and strategically important operations within the overall corporation, which are better embedded and more suited to the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy in the medium to long term. I am pleased that IDA Ireland is making some progress in this regard with two expansion projects announced in April 2004 for Killarney and a third for Kenmare announced in November 2004. At the end of 2004, the latest year for which figures are available, there were 2,022 people in permanent employment in 21 IDA supported companies in County Kerry.The following table shows the number of jobs lost in IDA supported companies in Kerry in each of the years from 2000 to 2004, inclusive:Year20002001200220032004Jobs lost8857670321284

The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals.Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in this Department are outlined in the annual reports of the committee and are available at www.finance.gov.ie. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.Prior to the introduction of the revised scheme in 2002, there was a scheme for assistant secretaries which was based on 4% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Under this scheme payments were made to seven assistant secretaries totalling €23,038 and €20,092 for the years 2000 and 2001. Amounts paid to individuals under this scheme are regarded as personal information.

Following a review of her claim by a social welfare inspector a deciding officer disallowed payment with effect from 10 February 2005 on the grounds that she had been cohabiting from that date until 24 August 2005. As a consequence, she is deemed to have been overpaid a total of €4,320.40. The person has appealed against this decision to the social welfare appeals office and the relevant papers and comments of the deciding officer on the matters raised in the appeal were sought. As soon as these are available the case will be referred to an appeals officer for consideration.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

This age limit can be extended to age 22 years in certain circumstances, including where the parent of a full-time student is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment such as one-parent family payment, or a short-term social welfare scheme for six months, and where the child is attending a full-time course of education or training. Disability benefit is considered to be a short-term scheme for this purpose.Where the spouse of a disability benefit recipient is earning up to €220 per week, full rate CDI is payable. Where earnings are between €220 and €350 per week, half rate is payable. Beyond this level of earnings, no CDI is payable. Payment of CDI for both disability benefit and one-parent family payment ceases when a child is no longer of a qualifying age, becomes eligible to claim a social welfare payment in his or her own right, or when the claimant's own entitlement to payment ceases.

The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals.Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, available on the website  www.finance.gov.ie. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information. Prior to the introduction of the current award scheme which came into effect from January 2002, a bonus scheme based on 4% of the pay bill for the group of assistant secretaries and which provided for payments of up to 15% for the deputy secretary grade applied.The total awards made in the Department under the terms of this scheme in respect of the bonus periods 1999-2000 and 2000-end 2001 were €30,608, to six people, and €53,432, to seven people, respectively.In addition there is a scheme for recognition of exceptional performance by staff which operates across the Civil Service. This scheme has been in operation since 1996 and allows Secretaries General to make awards for sustained exceptional performance to staff. Awards may be made in respect of performance above the level which would reasonably be expected in the normal course from the grade of staff involved. All staff in the Department, irrespective of grade, can nominate another staff member or a team for an award, at any time during the year.

The purpose of CSI is to progress effective implementation of traffic management and related measures in the greater Dublin area and to bring added value to major transport investments that are under way and planned. In so doing, we are taking account of the experience of an initiative, entitled the Inzeller Kreis initiative, which was jointly established by the Mayor of Munich and BMW in 1995. It is my hope that through the CSI we can learn lessons from the earlier initiative that will help to achieve better traffic management in the greater Dublin area. The following are the names of the individuals who have agreed to participate in the initiative, with an indication of those who attended the meeting in Clontarf Castle on 5 October 2005. Members were invited to join the CSI on a personal basis rather than as a representative of any agency, company or interest, and to bring only their own views to the table.The CSI charter, adopted in Clontarf Castle at its inaugural meeting on 5 October, makes it clear that the initiative will work with existing agencies and within existing governance structures and that it will be the responsibility of the relevant statutory, or other, agencies to decide whether to proceed with projects suggested by the initiative. I have arranged to have copies of the CSI charter placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Deputies.Members of the CSI tabled 37 projects in advance of the seminar on 5 October 2005. Workshops were held to consider those projects in detail. Each of three workshop groups presented their chosen projects to the plenary session, whereupon they were considered and a short list of projects, in some cases involving an amalgamation of individual projects was identified. The list of projects is not finalised, however, as it still requires those who have been identified as sponsors of individual projects to confirm their acceptance of such sponsorship.

For that reason the central target established for the strategy was focused on the realisation of a reduction in the number of road deaths.The strategy included a commitment to the pursuit of a programme aimed at establishing a more robust basis for determining injury data based on the information flow from the Garda to the National Roads Authority allied to information from hospital admission data and insurance claims. This exercise is being pursued by a number of organisations that are represented on the road safety high level group under the general direction of the National Roads Authority, which is tasked with the publication of national road collision data.Based on the outcome of that exercise the high level group will consider the establishment of an appropriate target for the achievement of a reduction in serious injuries before the completion of the period of the strategy.

The prescribed amount, which was established in 1994 at £75, is €95.23.Data in relation to the number of persons who were required to make the prescribed payment would be available from the Courts Service. Receipts for payments made under section 22 have been accredited to my Department's Vote, subhead F8, Miscellaneous Receipts, since 2003 and previously to the Vote of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.A separate entry for the receipts is not available for 2003. However, the total value of receipts in 2004 was €58,266 and the total to date in 2005 is €48,037. I am giving consideration to increasing the prescribed amount of this payment.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	661	On 17 August 2005, I announced a number of enhancements to the voluntary national genotype programme, NGP, aimed at encouraging greater participation in the programme and, in particular, to encourage the genotyping of rams in advance of the introduction of a compulsory breeding programme. These enhancements were introduced following discussions between officials of my Department and representatives of the pedigree and non-pedigree breeders.It was always intended, and it was made clear before their introduction, that the enhancements to the NGP would apply only in respect of those flocks/sheep that were genotyped between 1 September 2005 and 18 November 2005. There was never any question that rams which were tested before 1 September 2005 would be eligible for the flat rate of compensation that will be paid in respect of those categories of rams that are tested after that date and that are considered susceptible or highly susceptible to scrapie. Consequently, I do not intend to make the compensation payments retrospective.Since the enhancements came into effect on 1 September, there has been a significant increase in the number of NGP applications being submitted to my Department with over 200 applications, involving the genotyping of nearly 4,000 sheep, having been made to date.

Awards under this provision can be made in the case of all grades below assistant secretary level. The following table gives a breakdown of the moneys paid under this scheme in the years 2000 to 2004.Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee, available on the Department of Finance website. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.Prior to the introduction of the revised scheme in 2002, there was a scheme for assistant secretaries based on 4% of the pay bill for the group of assistant secretaries. In my Department a total of £27,000 was paid under this scheme in 2000 and £28,550 in 2001.Grade2000 Total2000 Highest2001 Total2001 Highest2002 Total2002 Highest2002F&M  Total*2002F&M  Highest*2003 Total2003 Highest2004 Total2004 Highest€€€€€€€€€€A/DS495495A/SAO495495AAI2,2046523,9001,5003,2158753,5755206,2951,000AI4,0846523,9108005,2757205,3051,3009,4002,000AO300300600600900450AP9,2001,0005,37055013,3302,8005,9951,0006,7501,000Area Supt4004001,8106051,2904451,8456005,1001,400Assistant Librarian1,0001,000Cleaner1,26060445445CO23,07050018,08060037,69660027,60670029,865750Dairy Inspector3,0001,000Dairy Produce Officer5005008758751,0001,000DCVO35,90015,200Deputy Chief Inspector1,5001,500DDVRL2,5502,550Director VRL4454452,5502,550DS5,8087509,7901,00012,4151,0007,3606004,4851,250EO17,11575012,64570017,05060016,30860022,135600Farm Manager490490Farm Operative490490General Operative300300500500Head Lab.

The value of this contract was €317,054. It was awarded a further contract, again following an open tendering process, in 2003, for the years 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. The contract value is €914,848, on a fixed fee basis. This is broken down per year as €216,368, €224,130, €232,847 and €241,503 for 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.Under the provisions of the EU Council Regulation No. 1258/99 on the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and Commission Regulation No. 1663/95, since 1995 the European Commission only finances expenditure that is made by paying agencies accredited by member states. As part of the accreditation process, the regulations require that the annual accounts of the CAP paying agencies in member states must be accompanied by an "attestation" certificate regarding the integrality, exactitude and veracity of the annual accounts. This certificate must be given by a certifying body that is operationally independent of the paying agency.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	669	I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 to 360, inclusive, together.I propose to take these questions together as they all concern the illegal and harmful uses of the Internet. The Internet is an international and world-wide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it. Measures to combat child pornography or other illegal materials and activities on the Internet are therefore hampered by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems, and differing societal norms. Furthermore, developments in new communications technologies allow for Internet access from many means other than the traditional personal computer.For the above reasons, combating the production and availability of child pornography on the Internet requires a combination of responses, and the co-operation of all the stakeholders, at both national and international levels — legislators, law enforcement, schools, child protection practitioners, and most important of all, parents and guardians.In terms of legislation, in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, Ireland has one of the most robust pieces of legislation anywhere. Under the Act, the possession, distribution, importation and exportation or sale of all forms of child pornography — films, videos, or material in written or auditory form including material produced or transmitted via the Internet — are offences with penalties of up to 14 years' imprisonment. Possession of child pornography can be punishable by imprisonment for up to five years. Using a child or allowing a child to be used for the production of child pornography is also punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment.The Garda Síochána is committed to the investigation of all cases of child pornography and the importance of investigating the child protection issues involved in such cases. The paedophile investigation unit was established in November 2002 within the domestic violence and sexual assault unit, under the remit of the national bureau of criminal investigation. The unit is assisted by members of other specialised units, as required. Computer forensics are carried out by the members attached to the domestic and sexual assault unit and also by members attached to the Garda bureau of fraud investigation utilising up-to-date forensic software.The unit liaises with other relevant outside agencies and international police forces, including Interpol and Europol, to keep abreast of the most recent developments and trends in this area. A proactive approach is taken regarding intelligence received relating to offences of child pornography and the Garda Síochána investigates all breaches of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 coming to its attention in the course of unrelated investigations, reported by external police forces, the Internet advisory board hotline, or by concerned citizens, and each case is investigated to a conclusion, many resulting in prosecutions before the courts.On the structural side, the Government established a working group in 1997 to examine and report on the whole question of the illegal and harmful use of the Internet with particular reference to child pornography. The report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet was published in July 1998. The main recommendation of the report was for a system of self-regulation by the Internet service provider industry and the components of such a system were to include: an Internet advisory board, IAB, established February 2000, to promote awareness of Internet downside issues, co-ordinate efforts to combat child pornography on the Internet and monitor the progress of self-regulation by the Internet service provider industry; a public hotline for reporting child pornography, established in 1999 and funded by the industry; an industry code of practice and ethics setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet service provider, agreed in February 2002 and reviewed in 2004.The Internet advisory board oversees and monitors progress on anti-child pornography measures, and supervises a self-regulatory regime for the Irish Internet service provider industry. The self-regulatory approach to Internet regulation has been adopted world-wide and the Internet advisory board helps and supports the Irish Internet service provider industry to deliver an effective self-regulation environment, in accordance with an agreed code of practice and ethics for the industry. The Irish code of practice and ethics is recognised throughout Europe as a model of its type.The Internet advisory board's brief extends to general downside issues on the Internet including general safety for children while online, as well as the conduct of research and information campaigns.The hotline www.hotline.ie, funded by the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Ireland with support from the EU safer Internet action plan, was launched in November 1999 and has been operating since that time. Special protocols operate between the Garda and the hotline that maximise co-operation on law enforcement issues so that offences in the area of child pornography can be detected and prosecuted.The hotline works closely with and is a founding member of the international INHOPE Association, www.inhope.org, a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world. The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography and other illegal materials. International co-operation is a vital part of the fight against child pornography on the Internet, and Ireland is fully committed to playing its part.In September 2001 the Council of Europe Ministers'deputies approved the first international convention on cybercrime. Ireland signed up to the convention in June 2002. The main objective of the convention is to foster international co-operation in protecting society against cybercrime. The convention deals specifically with the distribution of child pornography on the Internet, infringements of copyright, computer-related fraud and violations of network security.The European Union has taken a strong line on combating child pornography on the Internet. Since 1999, under the safer Internet action plan, the EU has provided financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children. A new EU action plan, Safer Internet Plus, covering the period 2005 to 2008, and with a budget of €45 million, was agreed under the Irish Presidency in June 2004 and is now in operation.The EU Council adopted a Framework Decision on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography on 22 December 2003. While the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is a particularly robust legislative measure, my Department is currently considering the question of whether additional legislative provisions are required to give effect to this framework decision.The mechanisms and structures described above to combat child pornography in particular can be and are used to address other criminal activities using the Internet. As a general rule, what is illegal off-line is illegal on-line. This could include illegal pornography, racist or hate materials, financial fraud, intimidation or any other criminal activity carried out via the Internet. However, the targeting of groups or individuals via the Internet by way of spam e-mails, for example, does not in all instances constitute a criminal offence. Bullying or intimidation may constitute an offence of harassment in breach of section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 including harassment via the Internet. The Garda Síochána will examine any complaints reported through the hotline, through other police forces or by members of the public, and where a criminal offence is disclosed, the matter will be fully investigated.My Department is committed to, and actively co-operates at national, EU and international level, addressing and promoting the means to combat any illegal and harmful uses of the Internet on an ongoing basis.

The visa application was refused for two reasons. First, the visa officer was not satisfied that a previous relationship history existed between the applicant and the reference in Ireland.Second, financial information was not provided, therefore the visa officer could not be satisfied that there would be no recourse to public funds or resources.An appeal of the decision to refuse the visa application was subsequently submitted on 6 September 2005. However, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision should be overturned. Consequently, the application was refused on appeal on 27 September 2005. As each application is entitled to only one appeal, no further review can be facilitated.

Rather the intention was that a sufficient number of interview rooms in Garda stations across the country be equipped to provide a broad nationwide coverage. In that regard, the most recent report of the steering committee on audio and audio and video recording of Garda questioning of detained persons found that, with the putting in place of additional units of equipment in a number of stations which already have the facility, there is a sufficient number of Garda stations, in all Garda divisions, to ensure that all interviews, as specified in the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations 1997 are recorded. Arising from the committee's report, I understand from the Garda authorities that a working group is examining the extension of these facilities. The committees' report was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in 13 June last.On the issue of CCTV in cells, the Deputy will appreciate that matters of some complexity, not least the right to privacy, arise in this regard. The Criminal Justice Act  1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations 1987 contain detailed provisions regarding the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations, including the requirement on gardaí to make visits at regular intervals to any person kept in a cell and the appropriate actions to be taken where persons detained appear to be unwell. On a related issue, a pilot project is under way involving Pearse Street and Store Street Garda stations to place CCTV in the reception areas and in the corridors leading to the cells. The results of the pilot will be carefully considered and will, I expect, inform the debate on extension of CCTV to the interiors of cells.

In June 2005, I announced the publication of a report of a working group of the national child care co-ordinating committee, entitled School Age Childcare in Ireland.The report makes a number of recommend-ations for the development of school age child care to support the child care needs of parents, including the use of school premises, where appropriate, as a location to develop a quality school age child care service. It also lays down guidelines for the delivery of a quality service. It is hoped that the publication of the report will give greater impetus to the future development of school age child care at local level.An application for capital grant assistance under the EOCP was submitted to my Department by the school referred to by the Deputy in July 2005. The capital grant application was forwarded to Area Development Management, ADM. Limited, which is engaged by my Department to carry out detailed assessments of all EOCP grant applications. Each application undergoes a thorough assessment by ADM to ensure it meets the EOCP funding criteria.I understand that this capital application is currently under assessment. When the assessment of the project in question is completed, the application will then be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, before a final decision is made regarding funding. The school will be informed of the outcome of this process in due course.

My Department has raised the issue referred to with that Department and has been informed that a meeting is scheduled in the near future between Women's Aid and the Health Service Executive, at which funding matters will be discussed.The responsibilities of my Department regarding the issue of violence against women relate to any necessary responses from the civil and criminal justice systems as well as any preventative measures which can be put in place, including intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence, and for awareness raising measures aimed at changing society's attitude to violence against women. Within this remit, my Department is also in discussion with Women's Aid regarding its funding needs. Earlier this year the commission for the support of victims of crime, which comes under my Department's aegis, provided Women's Aid with €28,000 to assist in the provision of a court accompaniment service for victims of domestic violence.A subcommittee of the national steering committee on violence against women, which is chaired by my Department, is examining the question of funding for the sector generally and its findings, which are expected shortly, will be addressed to the relevant Departments.

Included among the exemptions from the requirement to hold a firearms certificate are persons who are members of an authorised gun club while engaged, as such a member, in a competition or target practice at an authorised range. For this exception to apply, both the club and the range must be authorised.The Act provides that gun clubs and ranges may be authorised by a garda superintendent. However, a superintendent shall not grant such an authorisation unless he is satisfied that the possession, use or carriage of firearms in pursuance of such authorisation will not endanger public safety or the peace. In so far as the grant of an authorisation for a gun club or range is concerned, the courts have ruled that the superintendent is persona designate in relation to such decisions and cannot be fettered in any way. Accordingly, any person wishing to obtain such authorisation should apply to their local Garda superintendent.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	690	As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation scheme has been introduced under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs.My officials have been in contact with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which has confirmed that following examination of an application for additional support for the pupil in question, it was determined that her needs fall within the high incidence disability category. Therefore, her needs fall to be met from within the school's allocation of one full-time teaching post under the new general allocation system. This outcome was communicated to the school authorities on 6 September 2005.The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs, such as hearing impairment, will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school has been allocated enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.The school can use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.My Department has recently issued a comprehensive circular Sp Ed 02/05 to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.

The installation has been completed in all colleges. The MIS system comprises four integrated elements, namely, student registration; a financial element; a payroll-human resource element; and a library element. The system tracks all student records including registration, courses, link modules and examination performance. The financial system provides for individual budget responsibility within the institutes and it produces annual accounts. The payroll-human resource system links with the student system to facilitate time-tabling. The library system tracks all movements of materials and also facilitates on-line access to journals and articles by students and staff.I understand that the MIS has proved to be a critical and decisive element in the modernisation and transformation of the management and operation of the institutes of technology.

The eight staff seconded from institutes comprised, one registrar from Galway-Mayo IT, two at assistant principal officer level or equivalent grading from Sligo IT and IT Tallaght , two at grade 7 level from Waterford IT and IT Blanchardstown, two technicians from Sligo IT and Waterford IT and one librarian from Dundalk IT. They were replaced in the institutes for the duration of their secondments by means of a backfilling arrangement whereby other members of institute staff undertook their duties on a temporary basis.My Department has sought information from the individual institutes on the specific costs relating to each secondment and I will forward these to the Deputy as quickly as possible. In addition to the central implementation teams, each institute also redeployed members of technical and administrative staff internally to undertake necessary preparatory work locally in connection with implementation of the MIS applications as they were rolled out. I understand that, while the number of staff on these local implementations teams varied from institute to institute, there were on average five persons per institute engaged on local implementation teams at any given time. The members of local implementation teams changed as the different MIS applications were rolled out. Local implementation teams also gave rise to backfilling arrangements and the cost of this was borne by each institute from its own resources.

In addition, a technical inspection has been carried out on the existing buildings to determine which, if either, would be suitable to act as a host for the new school. A greenfield site solution will be necessary if a host does not emerge. The technical report will be available in my Department shortly.In the meantime, the project has been assessed in accordance with the prioritisation criteria for large scale projects.

The Deputy should note that these figures are provisional.Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-04 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1 — projected — in 2004-05. Over 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts regard has been had to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all of these priorities.In regard to providing for children with special educational needs, there are now over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which I launched recently. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.

However, as they do not reside at least two miles from the school concerned, as required under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, they were deemed ineligible for free transport. Pupils who do not meet the distance requirement may, subject to conditions, including the availability of spare seats after all eligible pupils have been accommodated, avail of concessionary fare-paying transport.My Department understands that one of the pupils concerned has been offered concessionary transport subject to the usual conditions, but that there were not sufficient seats available to offer the second pupil this option.

My Department has received a response from the Department of Health and Children stating that it does not have any records which indicate that a public body had a regulatory or inspection function in regard to this unit. As a consequence, it is not possible to give further consideration to the placement of this unit in the Schedule.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	699	The level of funding that my Department provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patrúnachta na Gaelscoileanna, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education.However, following discussions with Educate Together, my Department has provided additional funding to Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The matter of the future funding to be provided to the primary management bodies, including Educate Together, in 2006 will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process.In regard to support for the establishment of new multi-denominational schools, it should be noted that my Department has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage, 11 of which are open. My Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by Educate Together, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to €63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in under 13 months.

This is broken down as follows: Carr Communications — advice, assistance with publicity and practical support at events — €114,574.31; printing, launch and distribution of discussion document Your Education System — €109,051.53; all costs associated with 17 public meetings, this includes cost publicising each meeting in advance through the press and radio, the cost of hotels used, including provision of tea-coffee for all participants, the cost of providing chairpersons for each of the meetings, sound and audio recording, Irish sign language interpretation and meeting expenses incurred by those who participated as panellists at each meeting — €395,222.11; Educational Research Centre — acting as secretariat and set up and management of website — €61,099.64; the cost of public attitudinal survey — €63,888; cost of four focused meetings, three on socio-economic disadvantage and education and one children's meeting — €16,306.61; a report on the overall process has been drafted and will be published shortly. The purpose of the process has been to gather material that will inform education policy in the medium and longer term and to ensure that all interested individuals and groups had the opportunity to make their views known and to have these recorded. Any relevant portion of the final report will be among the items to be taken into consideration when planning medium and long term policy developments into the future but it was never envisaged that there would be a direct implementation process arising from the report.Detailed reports of all events held as part of the process continue to be accessible on the website www.youreducation.ie, along with contributions made by individuals and groups and the report on the public attitudinal survey.

It is a matter then for each national organisation to allocate funding on a regional basis as it considers appropriate. As a member organisation of the National Youth Federation the organisation in question receives funding from the national office. In addition, it receives grant-in-aid from the youth affairs section of my Department under the special projects for youth scheme and youth information centres funding scheme. The 2005 allocation under both these schemes is €295,768, which includes an 8% increase over 2004.

Since the task force was established early this year, it has come to grips with the breadth and complexity of this vitally important area. In tackling its job, it has consulted widely and built upon submissions, research and its own analysis to define sharply the areas where in, its final report, it will make recommendations to underpin future change. In its interim report, the task force set out the broad areas that emerged from its work to that date and which it anticipated would form the bedrock of its final report. The task force has engaged in an impressive level of consultation to date. It has held meetings with all of the partners in education individually since the publication of the interim report in July 2005. A plenary meeting with all the partners and the task force is being held today. I am particularly impressed with the ability of the task force to focus on the core issues. It has indicated it is on target to produce a final report and detailed recommendations in December 2005. I am greatly encouraged by the interim report and I look forward to receiving the final report and its recommendations.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	703	Since the introduction of the ICT in schools initiative in 1998, with the schools IT2000 programme, there has been significant progress in the development of the ICT infrastructure in our schools, in the enhancement of teachers' skills and pedagogical practice and in the development of curriculum and learning resources. My Department has provided capital grants to schools to enable them to purchase computers having regard to their identified needs and priorities as contained in their individual ICT school plans. One useful indicator in this regard is the ratio of pupils to computers, which has lowered from 37:1 in 1998 to 12:1 in 2002 in the case of primary schools and from 16:1 to 9:1 in the case of post-primary schools. The major focus for my Department currently is the rollout of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools. The provision of always-on high speed Internet access represent a major development in the ICT in schools initiative to integrate ICT into teaching and learning in our schools. This project builds on the recent investment of €20 million by my Department in providing grants to schools for the development of computer networking facilities. The development of internal networking facilities in schools is critical to supporting schools full exploitation of the potential offered by broadband connectivity.The National Centre for Technology in Education, via the ICT advisers in the local education centres, offers a range of courses to meet the continuing professional development of teachers in the area of ICT. My Department is currently examining the future priorities for the ICT in schools initiative and this work is complemented by a further census of ICT infrastructure which is being undertaken by the NCTE and an evaluation of the impact of ICT in teaching and learning in schools, which my Department's inspectorate is embarking on.

The entry requirement for the programme is set at this level to maintain and enhance the quality of teaching and learning in our schools into the future. This entry requirement, together with other criteria, is applicable to all those graduates who wish to consider primary teaching as a career. As all the criteria are common for all applicants, I do not intend changing the academic requirement for any individual or group of individuals or to make an exception in such cases.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	706	The person in question does not hold relevant teacher qualifications and is employed as an unqualified regular part-time teacher in a secondary school. It has for many years been a condition for membership of the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme that the teacher should be fully qualified. The admission of unqualified teachers to membership of the scheme is being addressed by my Department in the context of the implementation of the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001 and the Protection of Employees (Fixed-term Work) Act 2003. Schools will be advised of the appropriate arrangements in this regard following consultation with the relevant staff and management bodies. Following recent clarification by the Department of Finance of the application of the part-time work Act to public service pension schemes, my Department expects the consultative process will be completed within a matter of months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The project to which the Deputy is referring was established in 2001 as a pilot project to provide assessments for children between the ages of 12 and 16 years from the Finglas and Ballymun areas of the northside of Dublin who had been referred by the courts. The project was a co-operative venture between my Department and the probation and welfare service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It was funded as an interim measure, under the children at risk fund of my Department up to December 2003, when funding and responsibility for it was transferred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and placed under the auspices of the probation and welfare service. The service has adopted this responsibility with a view to the project fulfilling a role under the Children Act 2001. The service has the responsibility of establishing and developing day centres under the Act and it has indicated its desire for the project to fulfil this role.In this regard, the board of directors of the project has considered how best to meet its funding obligations and type of service it could provide as a day centre. As was originally intended when funding was made available to it in 2001, the project will, in future, cater mainly for children on whom a request has been made by the courts to the probation and welfare service for a probation officer's report. It may also provide a service to referrals from other relevant State and community based services, when resources allow, and it will also be open to children who have had contact with the project in the past to attend occasionally where this is considered to be in the best interest of the children concerned.My Department will continue to provide for a range of educational disadvantage initiatives which successfully operate in the Finglas and Ballymun areas of Dublin, including the disadvantaged areas scheme, Giving Children An Even Break, Breaking the Cycle and the Early Start programmes. There are also two successful school completion programmes in these areas, with a financial allocation of €752,000 in 2005, which aim to prevent early school leaving and support young people with characteristics and behaviour that are indicative of risk.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	710	My Department operates two bonus or merit schemes for all staff — a performance-related awards scheme for posts at the level of assistant Secretaries General and a merit scheme that recognises exceptional performance for all other grades up to and including principal officer and equivalent in the Department. Civil Service posts at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards, which was introduced in 2002. The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals. Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee — available on the website, www.finance.gov.ie. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.Prior to the introduction of the current scheme, there was a scheme of awards for assistant Secretaries General which was based on 4% of the pay bill for assistant Secretaries General. Payments under the Department's merit scheme for staff up to and including principal officer and equivalent grades are made annually. The scheme introduced in 2000, was recently reviewed. Following the review, individual awards were increased to €1,000 for all grades and group awards increased to €250 per group member. Nominations for individual and group merit awards in respect of 2004 and 2005 were recently sought from staff. A committee representative of all grades will meet in November to consider all nominations.Criteria for receipt of an award under the merit scheme for grades up to and including principal officer and equivalent grades include consistently high performance, creative application of skills and initiative to the resolution of difficult issues, development of new procedures and processes which increase the effectiveness and-or quality of a service, exceptional commitment shown in the implementation of specific measures, establishment and maintenance of high standards of quality in the delivery of a particular services, highly effective co-ordination of activities which results in meeting targets ahead of schedule, assuming effective control in areas when urgent action is required to maintain quality-credibility of an educational service and-or providing leadership of a project team resulting in improved performance.Between 2000 and 2003, the merit scheme allowed for individual and group awards of varying levels. Principal officers and equivalent grades received individual awards of £600 or €761.84 in 2000 and 2001, €750 in 2002 and €825 in 2003. Assistant principals and equivalent grades received individual awards of £400 or €507.90 in 2000 and 2001, €750 in 2002 and €825 in 2003. Higher executive officers and equivalent grades received individual awards of £350 or €444.41 in 2000 and 2001, €500 in 2002 and €550 in 2003. All other grades received individual awards of £250 or €317.43 in 2000 and 2001, €500 in 2002 and €550 in 2003. Group awards ranged between £125 or €158.72 in 2000 and 2001, €250 in 2002 and €275 in 2003.

It is the duty of registration authorities to ensure as far as possible the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register; in carrying out this work, registration authorities depend to a significant degree on the co-operation and engagement of the general public.The focus of my Department's work in respect of the register is to support and assist registration authorities through, inter alia, ensuring that an appropriate legislative framework is in place, developing best practice guidelines for registration authorities and overseeing related national awareness campaigns. While I will continue to keep these issues under review, including the scope for further initiatives in the area, there are no proposals along the lines referred to in the question.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	716	As part of an overall EU commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% during the Kyoto Protocol period 2008-12, Ireland is committed to limiting emissions to 13% above 1990 levels.The latest available greenhouse gas emissions figures from Ireland's national inventory report, compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency, show overall emissions in 2003 to be 66.57 million tonnes C02 equivalent. This figure is equivalent to approximately 25% above 1990 levels. This figure is a significant improvement on the corresponding figure for 2001, 31%, and 2002, 29%, down from approximately 29% in 2002 and 31% in 2001. These figures show that progress is being made towards the 13% target. Through a combination of actions, including emission reductions, participation by Irish industry in the EU emissions trading scheme and the purchase of carbon emission credits through the mechanisms provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, I am satisfied that Ireland is on a pathway to deliver on its emission limitation commitment for the purpose of the protocol.

Numerous meetings between officials from my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food and farming representatives have taken place seeking to agree management prescriptions for these habitats and to assess losses and costs to landowners arising from the implementation of these prescriptions. Agreement would allow farmers, other than those who opt for the REP  scheme, to be compensated by my Department for actual costs and losses arising from implementation of the necessary management prescriptions.While it has not yet proved possible to resolve these matters fully, my Department is maintaining contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food and farming representatives to see how agreement might be finalised.

In the interim I understand that the city council has arranged for emergency works to be carried out to secure the building temporarily and make it watertight while its future is being decided. I am anxious that the necessary studies be finalised as soon as possible by the council, so that an informed decision can be made about the building.I have not met with Dublin City Council or the owner in respect of No. 16 Moore Street. However, an officer of my Department did accompany Dublin City Council and its advisers in their inspection of the interior of the building on 25 August 2005.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	721	Under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, each planning authority was obliged to draw up, by 10 March 2004, a development contribution scheme which would state the basis for determining the contribution to be paid in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area.It is a matter for the elected members of each planning authority to decide on the scale of charges, the level of exemptions, the duration and other details of their council's development contribution scheme. The local councillors also determine when it is appropriate to review their scheme. In a circular letter issued by my Department in June 2003, planning authorities were advised that their development contribution schemes should be adopted for a specified period and that, in deciding on the lifetime of the schemes, a planning authority should consider the period within which the provision of capital projects may be reasonably projected. It was also recommended that a development contribution scheme should be reviewed at two to three year intervals at least, where the scheme is adopted for a longer period.

The assessments were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2004 — 2006 published in May 2004.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	725	Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers, namely, manufacturers and importers of farm plastics, silage bale wrap and sheeting, are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste. The IFFPG is a not-for-profit organisation and it is a matter for the company, under the terms of this producer responsibility initiative and in accordance with the polluter pays principle, to set a rate of levy which will cover its operational costs.The scheme has operated successfully to date. It is estimated that around 8,500 tonnes, approximately 55%, of farm plastics placed on the market in 2004 were collected for recycling. An estimated 55,000 farmers availed of the collection service in 2004. IFFPG estimate that over 12,500 tonnes of farm plastics have been collected in 2005. While responsibility for the collection and recovery of farm plastics rests with the compliance scheme, my Department monitors the scheme on an ongoing basis. I am aware of the specific issues raised in respect of the operation of the scheme. Discussions are taking place involving my Department and IFFPG to explore options for improvement to the scheme and resolution of outstanding issues.

The operation of the scheme is overseen by the committee for performance awards. Since 2002, the funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals.Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee for performance awards, available on the website www.finance.gov.ie. The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.Prior to 2002, the scheme was based on 4% of the paybill for the group of assistant secretaries; the total amount paid in 2000 was €15,051 and in 2001 it was €11,518, a nine month period.The provisions for the recognition of exceptional performance scheme, REPS, as outlined in the administrative budget agreements 1999-2001 and 2002-04 permit expenditure of up to 0.2% of the Department's payroll costs for the purposes of the scheme. In accordance with these provisions, criteria for this Department's REPS were developed in consultation with the Department's partnership committee, and provide recognition for individual and group achievements across the Department. The maximum payable, net of income tax, to individuals under the scheme is €650 per annum. The total payments made under the REPS scheme in respect of individual and group awards for each year since 2000 are outlined in the following table:2000200120022003200440,87446,01851,10572,68087,519
