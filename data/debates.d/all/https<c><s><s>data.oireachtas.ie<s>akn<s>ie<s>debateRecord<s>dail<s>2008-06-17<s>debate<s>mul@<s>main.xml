            <p eId="para_10">First, I am glad the Taoiseach has stated the Government accepts the result of the referendum and that he has communicated this to his European colleagues.  It is important that everyone accepts and respects the decision the people made on Thursday.  Therefore I ask whether he accepts, and if he will ask his European colleagues to accept, that based on that decision, the ratification of the Lisbon treaty now cannot be completed by the 27 member states as was required.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">Second, the Taoiseach indicated he would address the issue of the reasons for the treaty's rejection.  Does he accept the necessity for some time to be taken, both as between this country and our European partners and within this country, to reflect on the result and to understand fully the reasons the treaty was rejected and people voted as they did?  I refer to the need to understand more fully the deep-seated unease that exists among people about the future in respect both of our relations with Europe and of the economy, people's livelihoods and so on.  In doing all this, we need to reflect and understand the will of all the people, both those who voted for and those who voted against the treaty.  While there was a clear decision, it also is fair to state that opinion was fairly evenly divided and the views and opinions of all the people, both those who voted for and those who voted against, must be reflected.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">Finally, does the Taoiseach accept — I understand from his answer he probably does — that although the treaty itself was rejected, the vote did not constitute a rejection of the European Union and that the overwhelming majority of the people want this country to play a constructive and progressive part in building the future of Europe?</p>

            <p eId="para_13">As Members are aware, for a treaty to come into effect all states first must ratify it.  Our national process and tradition in Ireland was to have a referendum on it.  Other national processes exist in which countries wish to indicate where they stand in respect of the treaty and they are entitled to so do.  Whether it comes into effect depends on whether all states ratify it and clearly, the decision last Thursday means we are not in a position to ratify.  When the Lisbon treaty was agreed at the Heads of State and Government level, we agreed collectively that all states would proceed to ratification and would put the question consistent with their national processes.  This process is ongoing, 18 member states have done so and there have been indications that others wish to continue to do so.  We must respect this in the same way we expect our referendum to be respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">What is clear is that we are now in an uncertain situation about our future relationship with Europe, where the European Union wants to go and our place in it. My job is to try to ensure that Ireland remains very much engaged with the Union, that the decision made is respected and that we consult with others as it is a treaty between 27 countries.  I want to hear their concerns now that this has occurred in Ireland and to see if there is a way forward.  The political implications are not simply for Ireland, but there are wider legal and political implications for the Union as a whole in terms of the direction in which it wants to go.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">A treaty was brought forward after seven years of discussion and involved compromises on all sides.  We cannot now come to a hasty conclusion at this stage.  I have indicated my position on it and we must see where we go from here.  We are in uncertain waters.  If we were ratifying the treaty, we would be able to say where we were going.  The law on the treaties is clear.  All parties to the treaty must ratify it for it to come into effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">Does the Taoiseach agree it is too soon to rush to conclusions on what the decision means for what is required to move things forward?  Does he have any plans to put in place a process by which the opinions of people who voted last Thursday can be ascertained in order to ratify a different treaty?  How does he see the future panning out?  I accept his point that each country will proceed to make its own decision and just as we would not wish them to tell us what to do, we are not telling them how to ratify it either.  That is a matter for each individual country.  However, if the other 26 member states proceed to ratify the treaty, how does he see that playing out?  Is he assured by the fact the Minister for Foreign Affairs was told yesterday that the other 26 countries would not proceed without Ireland, and that a way will be found where all 27 member states will move together?  There does not seem to be as many takers for the early idea of a two-speed arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">Does the Taoiseach accept that the decision was made last Thursday and it is not possible to put the same proposition to the people a second time?  When he addresses his colleagues on Friday, what answer will he give them to those questions?</p>

            <p eId="para_18">I have already made it clear that we are in uncertain and uncharted territory.  I cannot anticipate the outcome of discussions which have yet to take place, the concerns I will be able to express and the responses others may give to me.  I do not expect that to be resolved this week, the following week or the week after.  The process of engagement must now begin where we assess the reasons for the vote and see if there are ways we can address those concerns.  I do not know whether we can address those concerns, some of which are contradictory.  People voted against the treaty for a range of reasons.  Different people had different perceptions and a different view of what the treaty involved, which may or may not have been objectively based on the treaty provisions.  To what extent can the Government or the Irish people be assisted in addressing some of those concerns remains to be seen.  We must assess and take stock of last week's result.  I intend to start a process that will garner as accurate a picture as possible for the motivation and reasons behind the votes on all sides.  That does not take away from the fact that a majority voted "No" last Thursday and that fact of life must be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">In the spirit of solidarity that has always been part of the Union's methodology, other member states indicate that they wish to hear from us and to enter into a process of consultation and dialogue to see whether there is a way forward so that the objectives of the EU can be achieved and its citizens can be best served by the Union being effective etc.  As was said during the campaign, there is not a plan B or a plan C.  This was the outcome of long and deliberate negotiations on the treaty.  A judgment was given by the Irish people last Thursday and that reality must be accommodated in terms of the discussions that must take place among the 27 member states, in view of the law on the treaty which states that it cannot be ratified unless everyone agrees to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">One thing I did not hear people say during the campaign was that Ireland should pull out of Europe.  Under the proposed Lisbon treaty the opportunity exists for any country to do so.  Clearly, there is a disconnect between Government and the Irish people in so far as Europe and its workings are concerned, as highlighted in the Dáil last December by the Taoiseach's predecessor when he said that the issue of water charges in respect of schools was a direct consequence of the EU water directive, which it was not.  There is a myriad of reasons that people voted against the treaty, some of which were related to the manner in which Ireland has implemented directives, whether 1,300 sections in a cross-compliance form or whatever.  The Taoiseach knows that as well as I do.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Is the Taoiseach prepared to deal with the disconnect as regards the implementation of European directives between the Government and the Irish citizens?  No matter what happens in the future, that lingering attitude will remain unless it is dealt with.  Will the Taoiseach ask his Ministers to look at the manner in which they are implementing European directives in so far as the Irish citizenry is concerned?</p>
            <p eId="para_35">How many Heads of Government has the Taoiseach contacted since the referendum results were announced?  There was a genuine concern among many of those who voted "No" about the future and progress of Europe, how far it should go etc.  Clearly there is a need for Europe to reaffirm what the European project is about, its future, where we are headed and what this means.  The Taoiseach should say to his European counterparts that there clearly is a need for a reaffirmation of what the European project means.  The Lisbon treaty proposed that Council meetings be held in public which would deal, in part, with the disconnect, but that disconnect exists between our citizens and Europe and that must be spelled out by Heads of Government.  How many Heads of Government has the Taoiseach spoken to since the referendum or has he been in contact with any of them in view of the European Council meeting on Friday?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_12">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_36">EU law is implemented in Ireland in compliance with legal requirements.  We do all we can to make it as simple and proper as possible.  It also must meet the principles of accountability and must be fair and proportionate.  The whole idea behind the Lisbon treaty was to delineate more clearly those areas of competence that were exclusive to the institutions, those that were mixed and those that could be dealt with at national level.  There was an explicit treaty provision regarding the question of proportionality and subsidiarity being a fundamental part of how the European Union would work in the context of the treaty being ratified but we are not now in that position as we rejected it in a referendum last Thursday.  It remains a continuing issue, however.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">Trying to ensure the European Union is seen as more relevant to the lives of our people and how it has a direct effect on them is a continuing challenge.  It is one issue that affects the political culture here as well as is in other member states.  It varies from country to country but none can claim to have cracked that particular nut adequately to anyone's satisfaction.  That is an ongoing matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">I spoke to the President of the European Commission, the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, and the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker. I will speak to several other Heads of Government tomorrow.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">The issue was dealt with at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting yesterday.  As is the norm, the general initial discussion and assessment took place there in preparation for the forthcoming European Council meeting.  I will deal with the issue in a formal way at the Council meeting, but no decisions will be taken on Thursday.  Obviously, we will have to outline a process of engagement with colleagues and the European institutions as to how we can bring this matter forward.  My primary responsibility is to formally bring to the attention of EU colleagues the outcome of the referendum result and that the treaty has not been ratified in Ireland.  I will also draw their attention to Ireland's wish to remain fully engaged in the European Union, to be part of its processes and to find a process of engagement which acts upon the solidarity that has been demonstrated by EU colleagues to this country in view of the non-ratification of the treaty as a result of the referendum result.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">There is no immediate quick-fix solution available.  There is a serious political and legal situation that must be examined and discussed.  Those are the facts of the matter and any suggestion to the contrary would be to minimise the position.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_13">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_41">This is not a 26-versus-one situation, this is a group of 27 countries with a set of objectives and principles to be achieved.  The beauty of EU treaties to date has been that they have been able to accommodate a very broad range of views, cultures and positions from different countries and governments.  In the Taoiseach's discussions with the Commission President, Mr. Barroso, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown and the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, did any of them indicate a willingness for or comment on a full renegotiation of the Lisbon treaty?  Will the Taoiseach comment on the report in the <i>Financial Times</i> today of the likelihood of explanatory protocols being produced by the Heads of Government meeting in October, dealing with the issues of real concern as expressed by the Irish electorate in Thursday’s vote?  This report states that the French in particular are anxious to move on and that explanatory protocols will be produced by October.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">I note reports today of a media survey carried out by the European Commission as to the reasons Irish people voted against the treaty and their concerns in so voting.  Has the Government any intention of carrying out an in-depth analysis in order to determine as accurately as possible that range of concerns?  Will the Taoiseach comment on the Referendum Commission?  I do not mean any disrespect to the eminent persons serving on the commission but there were a number of moments which did not help the treaty campaign in terms of explanation and objectivity.  Should a group of eminent independent experts be appointed to negotiate on behalf of all sides with persons who were involved in the "No" campaign?  This would be a negotiation on the alternatives which these people proposed but which need to be fleshed out, such as their views about the future and connectivity and so on.  Given the majority vote against the treaty, it is obvious there are concerns across a broad spectrum of the population.  It would be feasible and proper to tease out what are the concerns of some of the groups and persons involved in the "No" campaign.  Does the Taoiseach envisage a situation where either the persons assigned to the Referendum Commission or some such body could deal with these concerns and discover whether there is flesh behind some of those ideas?  The Taoiseach will be aware that many bogus ideas were put out.  Such an examination might be helpful in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">We respect the rights of other countries to ratify this treaty in their own way, just as they must respect the decision of the Irish people in the way they voted.  Where does the Taoiseach envisage the real crux happening?  We do not want a two-speed Europe and nobody has expressed the intention of leaving the European Union.  What will be the Government's position if the other 26 member states ratify the Lisbon treaty and then look to the Taoiseach for the Irish position?  Where will the Government be situated before that point arrives?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_44">The Deputy has raised many issues and I will deal with them as best I can.  With regard to any reports about what might be likely to happen, these are speculative by their very nature since no meetings have taken place yet.  The European Council is meeting on Thursday and it will begin rather than finalise a process of consultation.  These are speculative opinions being expressed which are the responsibility of those who make them and the best of luck to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">The second issue raised by the Deputy is the analysis of the result.  We will conduct our own analysis of the situation and take whatever soundings are required to compile a fair analysis of the reasons for the outcome and to take account of the reasons people voted "Yes" or "No".  We need to see the full picture.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">The Referendum Commission acquitted itself well throughout the campaign.  Some issues were raised concerning a press conference and certain questions were asked which did not get an immediate answer.  Obviously, the commission was insisting on getting an accurate answer out, providing it was to the best of its ability at that time.  In fairness to the Referendum Commission, its objectivity has never been in question.  It performed its functions to the best of its ability, in line with the mandate it had.  I do not wish to engage in any criticism whatsoever of the Referendum Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">As regards speculating on how this process will proceed, I cannot anticipate that other than to say that we want to work constructively and engage in a way that will hopefully help us to resolve the problem if we can.  The only way one can get to that point is to assess the outcome of the result, discuss the various options with them and find out from them their view of the situation.  That must all come into the equation.  That is the issue with negotiations on this or any other treaty, or any political or legal agreement — one negotiates to the point where one finds an accommodation that is acceptable to all.  It is not the ideal for any one party or set of parties, it must be something that is agreeable to all.  That is the basis upon which one tries to proceed.  Obviously there is no point in speculating on any of that at this stage.  Let us take this step by step, recognising that there is a complex issue here which remains to be resolved.  We know what the overall legal position is in terms of the assent of all parties to the agreement being required for it to come into effect.  We know that a discussion must now take place.  We have to listen to the views of others and we must set out our views as best we can gauge them in terms of what has occurred in the past week, the outcome, how we would like to proceed to get a process in place and engage.  Until all of that happens, it is frankly premature to talk speculatively about where all of this will end up.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">It is important to note that there was a major turnout, which is something to be encouraged.  I note the Taoiseach's responses to the earlier questions and his commentary over the past few days.  Having noted his reference to respect the outcome of the referendum decision next Thursday, will the Taoiseach confirm that he will act in accordance with the democratically expressed wish of the Irish electorate last Thursday?  If he has determined them at this point, will he outline what steps he proposes to take, or envisages taking, in order to proceed with a project that will hopefully deliver a better deal not only for Ireland but for Europe as a whole?</p>
            <p eId="para_51">Does the Taoiseach share my concern at the remarks of European Commission President, José Manuel Barroso, that the remaining ratifications should continue to take their course?  Does the Taoiseach see in that comment, and in the commentary of others in Europe, a two-tier approach already <i>in situ</i>?  Back in 2005, the rejection of the constitutional treaty by the French and Dutch resulted in an end to the process and it was never put to the Irish people.  Why would the decision of the Irish electorate last Thursday be viewed or treated any differently within Europe to that of the French or Dutch electorates?  Does the Taoiseach propose to affirm the Irish electorate’s equality within the determination of any treaty proceeding in line with that precedent?</p>
            <p eId="para_52">The point about Mr. Barroso's remarks is they suggest that the initial intent, namely, a partnership of equals, is no longer the reality.  Does the Taoiseach agree they were in stark contrast with the remarks made by Commissioner McCreevy yesterday when he indicated the people's verdict must be accepted?  The Commissioner was quite comprehensive in that respect and I and others here at home and, I hope, elsewhere interpret them as being in stark contrast with the remarks of Mr. Barroso.  Will the Taoiseach advise the House as to where he stands on these apparently conflicting positions?</p>
            <p eId="para_53">As the Taoiseach faces his first Council of Ministers meeting later this week, will he outline his approach and intent and the disposition he proposes to take?  Does he not accept that what he was dealt last Thursday is a strong hand to move forward not only in the interests of the Irish people but reflective of the concerns that are mirrored in each of the other 26 member states?  In some of the longer standing states within the European Union the numbers, percentage wise, who share the concerns expressed by the Irish people last Thursday are at least comparable.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">Both the President of the Commission and our Commissioner spoke about accepting and respecting the decision of the Irish people last Thursday.  There is a precedent.  When the Danish people rejected a previous treaty, ratification continued in other states.  The collective decision, which has already informed this particular treaty, was that each member state indicated it would proceed with a ratification process.  This is what has been taking place over the past couple of years.  We cannot question the wish of others to do this or to put their case in terms of what the treaty means for the future direction of the European Union when we expect them to respect our wishes.  Respect is a two way street and one has to accept that.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">On the Deputy's other question about going to the European Council meeting, while this is the first such meeting I will attend as Taoiseach, I have attended many European Council meetings.</p>

As I said, the indications at the General Affairs Council meeting on Monday were that our partners wish to demonstrate solidarity to Ireland, respecting the decision but obviously trying to determine where Europe goes and how it develops from here.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">All of us, including Deputy Ó Caoláin and his party, have been involved in negotiations.  One does not get what one sets out to achieve at the beginning.  One has to listen to the points of view of others and try to see if one can move from where one is to another position in a way that is agreeable to all.  That is the point.  Everybody can have a view about what the European Union is or is not but at the end of the day the agreement of everybody is required.  This means entering into these discussions in good faith, with a view to trying to confirm what I understood everybody in this jurisdiction was claiming, namely, that we are pro-Europe and pro-European Union and do not want to be marginalised, isolated or disadvantaged in the European Union.  My job, as Taoiseach, is to try to uphold our national interests and maintain our position in the Union, while recognising that the people made a decision last Thursday.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">The position is that a number of states have yet to ratify and we do not know whether they will proceed with ratification and what the outcome of their ratification processes will be.  However, let us say we end up in a situation where all of the remaining states have ratified and one has not.  Has the Taoiseach taken any legal advice as to what our situation will be at that point in insisting that the treaty cannot be ratified?  The worst case scenario is 26 states moving ahead on the basis of what is in the Lisbon treaty, perhaps calling it something other than the Lisbon treaty, and Ireland being left in a semi-detached situation.  Has the Government received any legal advice in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_60">What is the Taoiseach's assessment of the prospect of renegotiation of the treaty?  For example, one of the issues which arose quite prominently was the question of the Commissioner.  Is it possible to renegotiate a scenario where every state would have a Commissioner?</p>
            <p eId="para_61">While there is much focus on what will happen with the treaty and the European institutions, a concern of many people is what will happen to Ireland's relationship with the European Union in respect of day-to-day matters.  What consideration has been given by Government — I appreciate it has been a short time — to ensuring that when individual Ministers go to Council meetings to deal with matters such as agriculture, fisheries and the environment our interests will not suffer a collateral consequence?  Everybody will say that we will not suffer such a consequence and will state our entitlement and position, but there is an unspoken concern that Ireland's influence in respect of day-to-day dealings with the European Union may now be in a different place than it was a week ago.  What steps are being taken by Government to ensure that any such collateral damage is minimised?</p>

            <p eId="para_62">Rather than force a vote on the Order of Business, can we set aside business today to discuss this issue?  Obviously, it is a fundamentally important decision and there should be a full Dáil debate about the Lisbon treaty, its future and where we stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">In respect of the point raised by Deputy Gilmore, the Taoiseach will be faced with the question of dealing with the commissionership before the end of the year.  The Nice treaty required, and was approved on this basis, a reduction in the number of Commissioners below the number of countries unless the Heads of Government unanimously agreed some other position.  The Taoiseach must form a view on this in the period ahead.  It will come to a head before the end of the year and Ireland must have a view on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">How does the Taoiseach propose going about consulting in terms of forming that view?  People seemed to understand well that in voting "No" they were voting against the proposal under the Nice treaty, and at least bringing clarity under the Lisbon treaty, that every country would lose its Commissioner in strict rotation for a period.  While Commissioners do not make decisions in the way the Council does, this was an important element of people's views in the campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_65">Can we have a Dáil debate?  How does the Taoiseach propose to go about consulting widely in forming his view of what Ireland wants to do in respect of the Commissioner position because that is an important element of the Lisbon treaty and it might not require a constitutional referendum in the way that other matters clearly do?</p>

That action should be open to everyone in order to participate, help and guide as best each of us can.  Going forward together is the correct way to address the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">Does the Taoiseach accept that the real comparison in regard to Lisbon is not the previous Danish decision but the 2005 decisions of France and the Netherlands, given that 96% of the constitutional treaty was in-built in the Lisbon treaty proposals, and that we are not seeing parity of esteem and equality of treatment on which we should insist?  I urge the Taoiseach to take the position that the Irish people's decision deserves not only to be respected but to be accepted in its totality.</p>

            <p eId="para_68">As I said, no qualification has been put on acceptance of the decision.  Ratification arises from a collective undertaking by the states at the signing of the Lisbon treaty to proceed with instruments of ratification in each state.  Each state took on that undertaking.  We took on an undertaking, as did other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">I make the point that respect is a two-way street.  If one wants respect, one must accord it to others who are similarly engaged in a national process.  What the Deputy is asking me to do is to say otherwise.  The basis on which this ratification is proceeding arises out of a collective undertaking given by the member states at the time the Lisbon treaty was agreed.</p>

I was simply making the point when the Deputy tried to make a comparison with another situation that there is another situation which I could say goes in the opposite direction.  It is not relevant.  What is relevant to the ratification process is the collective undertaking given by the states at the time of the signing of this treaty.  All states are entitled to proceed along those lines.  If we were not proceeding with our national process, the Deputy would ask me why we were not doing so.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">On Deputy Kenny's question about where we go from here, we must have a discussion with colleagues.  They have indicated to us that they will try to assist us if they can in regard to how we would like to proceed.  We have to have that discussion, the outcome of which I cannot anticipate.  The only thing I can reiterate is that the treaty cannot be ratified unless all states ratify it.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">As we said during the campaign, there are consequences to decisions.  If we voted one way, we knew what we were getting but if we voted the other, we did not know.  What we know now is that we must have dialogue with others to see what emerges from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">The question of the commissionership was one of the great falsehoods or great ironies of the debate, that is, the idea that if one voted "No", one would keep one's Commissioner.  A provision in the Nice treaty refers to reducing the number of Commissioners once the EU reaches 27 member states<b>.  </b>The process by which that will be done has not been agreed but that is stated in the Nice treaty.  Our legal position in that regard was already established.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">The negotiating achievement of the Lisbon treaty was to bring about a situation where the reduction upon reaching 27 member states would be deferred to 2014 and that if there was unanimous agreement thereafter, it would be possible to continue with the existing arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_78">Let us be clear about this because it is a matter of public record.  During our presidency of the European Union in 2004 I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, said when the convention was established that we would like to see the retention of a Commissioner for each member state.  We were always of that view but we came to a negotiated position.  There were others who said we should reduce the number of Commissioners in the interests of the efficacy and efficiency of the Commission in order that everyone on the Commission would have a substantive job to do and that would be a better way.  We ended with negotiations which sought to meet the requirements of those with different views on these matters.  We ended up with an advance on the Nice treaty which was ratified by the Irish people.  That is the truth of the issue.  There is no legal basis for the claim in the misleading posters urging a "No" vote in order to keep our Commissioner.  One thing we are sure of is there is a stronger treaty provision for losing a Commissioner now than if there had been a "Yes" vote.  That argument was put a different way for other purposes and we will leave it at that.  Negotiations are about finding an accommodation which meets the interests of all where possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">I have recently decided that the air accident investigation unit of my Department, the railway accident investigation unit within the Railway Safety Commission, and the Marine Casualty Investigation Board should be located together.  The Government has recently accepted, as part of its decentralisation programme, that Drogheda should be the location for these functions.

            <p eId="para_87">I welcome whatever amalgamation the Minister proposes within his Department of the existing safety reporting of air accidents, marine safety matters and so on.  The stark facts are that there have been two fatal bus crashes recently, one in Kentstown, County Meath where sadly five people lost their lives and many were injured and another on Wellington Quay in Dublin in 2004 where five people also died and several more were injured.  The difference between the two crashes was the way in which they were investigated.  The Garda properly investigated both, but the Health and Safety Authority could only investigate the accident in Kentstown, County Meath and could not investigate the Dublin Bus accident on Wellington Quay.  We need an independent authoritative examination of all accidents where there are fatalities, especially for those involving public transport.  Families need closure on these issues.  There is no closure for the families involved as the Dublin Bus report into the crash on Wellington Quay remains to this day unpublished.  It is not acceptable that Dublin Bus refuses to publish the report.  I ask the Minister to address this issue, as the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, gave a commitment to a review of safety procedures in Dublin Bus.</p>

There are no plans to have anybody other than the Garda and, where appropriate, the Health and Safety Authority investigate road traffic accidents.  The accident that the Deputy adverted to was investigated fully by the Garda.  It initiated a very thorough investigation which led to a court case and evidence being produced.  CIE and Dublin Bus also investigated the matter very thoroughly and, as is normal in any such accident where lives have been lost, any lessons that can be learned are learned and put into practice which is the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">I am amazed with the Minister's reply.  Has the Minister for Transport sought a copy of the Dublin Bus report into that fatal accident?  The answer is that he has not.  What lessons have been learned following that accident?  We do not know and the Minister for Transport does not know, as he has not sought a copy of the report.  I have sought a copy and it has been refused to me for legal reasons.  However, we have had legal problems with reports previously.  The report on the accident in Kentstown will be published by Bus Éireann.  The Minister has a duty of care, in the public interest, to insist Dublin Bus publishes its report into the accident on Wellington Quay.  We do not know the findings of this report.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">If the Minister does not set up an independent body to investigate such accidents which, unfortunately, are outside the remit of the Health and Safety Authority then we have no independent way of assessing the important resulting information.  Throughout the country people who lose family members in accidents, including road traffic accidents, and where there are fatalities and serious injuries have no closure as the reports are not published.  There are reports produced apart from Garda investigations.  We want them all in the public domain.  The Minister is failing in his duty of care if he does not set up within his Department an independent investigation unit into road traffic accidents and accidents involving private and public bus companies.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Deputy Noel Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_105">I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 68 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">The Road Safety Strategy 2007 to 2012, as approved by the Government in October 2007, identifies the need to legislate for and introduce a reduction in the legal blood alcohol content, BAC, level for drivers, but does not specify what that level should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">The advice of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, on the lower levels was received in April and was submitted to Government.  The Government noted the recommendations of the RSA and decided the advice should be published and taken into account in the preparation of legislation under the road safety strategy.  The general scheme of a Bill is being prepared in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">Notwithstanding that the allocation of resources to the various programmes is a matter for the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, the issue of funding for the Bureau for any one year is considered in the context of the overall funding and resources for my Department and its non-commercial state agencies for that year and any funding submissions received from those agencies.  I have provided increased funding for the bureau's recent move to new premises in University College Dublin, Belfield and have also increased the bureau's staff allocation.  The bureau has allocated a total of €6.42 million in 2007 and the estimates process for 2009 has not yet begun.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_109">We know that drink driving plays a role in approximately 37% of accidents.  Half of all accidents involving young men are caused by drink driving.  There are lower limits in our EU partners, about which we were talking a few minutes ago.  Countries like Slovenia, Poland and Sweden have a limit of 20 mg.  Do the Minister and the Minister of State agree that the limit should be reduced?  Is it the policy of the Government to reduce the blood alcohol limit from 80 mg to 50 mg?  Will legislation be introduced in that regard?  Is the Government planning to introduce reduced penalties, such as administrative penalties, for first-time drink driving offences or offences involving a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg?  It was recently indicated in the media that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, have gone soft on drink driving as a result of the massive vintners campaign, which is ongoing.  Is that the case?  In the last Dáil, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, bitterly opposed administrative penalties for fisheries offences.  Is he now proposing to provide for administrative penalties for drink driving offences?</p>
            <p eId="para_110">Drug driving testing programmes have been developed in many other parts of the world, including the Australian state of Queensland.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, visited Australia to learn about projects of that nature.  The drug levels of drivers can be tested at the side of the road.  An insurance company, Hibernian, recently reported that approximately 20% of male drivers under the age of 35 admitted in a survey that they have driven under the influence of drugs.  Does the Government have any policies in this regard?  Does it intend to introduce a system of roadside drug testing?  A number of companies, including at least one Irish company, have indicated that a test kit is available.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">The Deputy is right to point out that Ireland's limit of 80 mg is not in line with the limits in most other countries.  We have the same limit as the UK.  The limit in most other European countries is 50 mg.  The road safety strategy, which was launched last year, set out the Government's position in this regard.</p>

I accept that prototype tests are available in some countries, including Australia.  However, we do not have a feasible basis for doing that in Ireland.  I would like to get to that stage.  The old regime, whereby a garda has to form the opinion that a person is incapable of driving, is still in place.  We are considering the possibilities in this regard.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping up to date with the research into what is available.  There are various prototypes in certain parts of the world.  There is no agreed basis for doing that here.  We are considering the inclusion in the proposed legislation of a scheme that would help a garda to form an opinion that somebody is incapable of driving.</p>

            <from>Deputy Shane McEntee</from>
            <p eId="para_126">Any road safety measures introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, will get the full support of Fine Gael.  I would like to comment on a distasteful report in a newspaper last Monday week.  It seems that someone wanted to ascertain the response to the idea that drink drivers be given administrative penalties instead of being put off the road, in the context of a reduction in the limit from 80 mg to 50 mg.  We cannot afford to play politics on this subject.  I certainly will not do so.  I came in for a lot of flak when I spoke in a direct and straight manner about this matter.  I ask the Minister to face up to the problem.  We cannot afford to lose lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">The newspaper report that the Government is considering a change may be refuted.  Was it mere speculation, designed to see what would happen?  Did those who made the suggestion want to see if there would be an outcry from the public or from publicans?  I accept that the publicans lobby does a good job.  The changes which have been made in the interests of road safety represent part of the reason for the demise of rural life and pub life.  We should have a proper debate on the matter.  Young people are not fools — if they can buy a can of Carlsberg for €1, they will not spend €4 on it in the pub next door.  Such matters need to be considered.  It is not the case that the reduction in the drink driving limit is the only reason for the diminishing of rural life.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">As Fine Gael's road safety spokesperson, I will support the Government in this regard if it does a good job.  It seems that the number of road deaths is beginning to decrease.  We should not play politics of the kind that was played in a newspaper last Monday week.  We are lucky that the Road Safety Authority is still intact.  I do not know who caused this story to appear in the newspaper.  I do not know what the idea was.  If that is the way politics is going, it is not very nice.  The Government should say what it intends to do.  We will debate it and support it if it deserves support.  The Government should not wait until after the local elections.  The longer it waits, the more people will be killed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_129">I saw the newspaper article in question.  I know nothing about it.  That did not come from us.  Policy is made by the Government, rather than by the newspapers.  There was a brief discussion on this matter during the debate on the Estimates this day last week.  It was suggested that a committee should consider this matter and make a submission to the Department.  I have outlined the options.  No decision has been made.  We do not have a definite frame of mind on it yet.  We intend to introduce a lower limit, perhaps of 50 mg.  That would be a new trend.  While our limit of 80 mg is not in line with that of most countries, it is not the case that other countries always disqualify drivers who are found to be over the limit.  We are examining what is done abroad when drivers are found to have a level of between 50 mg and 80 mg.  In many cases, the penalty that is imposed is a fine or some penalty points.  We would like to hear from those who have a view on the matter, including the committee and individual Deputies.  The issue is whether we should disqualify everyone who is found to be over the limit.  We need to consider whether it might be more appropriate to provide for a fine or some penalty points, or a combination of the two, in some instances.  We have to make a decision on the matter.  Anyone with a view on it should make it known.  If the committee wants to make its voice heard, I would like to hear from it.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_69">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_130">I agree with my Fine Gael colleague on the issue of administrative penalties.  The report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> was so detailed that it had to have come from a source in the Department or the Government.  Has the proposal to impose administrative penalties, rather than the traditional penalty of disqualification, been discussed with the Road Safety Authority and the Garda Síochána?  The report indicated that people who are found to be just over the limit, or those who are convicted of a first offence, can argue that there were mitigating circumstances.  In his previous position, the Minister argued bitterly against administrative penalties in the case of fisheries offences.  It could be argued that such offences are much less serious than offences which lead to horrific road collisions.  Has this proposal been discussed?  I agree that it would be useful to discuss it at committee level.  Deputies O’Dowd and McEntee and I have been discussing these matters with the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for the past year.  People would like a decision to be made at this stage.  The Government seems to be rowing back — it is not telling us what it intends to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">I would like to ask about the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  The Minister of State does not seem to be familiar with some of the issues.  Some Australian states, such as Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland, have roadside drug testing.  The population of Ireland is similar to that of Queensland and at least 6,000 people were tested there last year.  It is happening in other jurisdictions.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, travelled to Australia not that long ago to get these exact details.  Is it not the case that the Minister of State is, at least in this sense, inadvertently misleading the House?  Also, is it not true that the Medical Bureau of Road Safety asked the previous Government for more resources in order to provide comprehensive drink and drug roadside testing?  Why are we still waiting for it at this stage?</p>

            <from>Deputy Shane McEntee</from>
            <p eId="para_132">I welcome the Minister of State's final comment that, at the end of the day, none of us wants to be the bad boys but we want to ensure our roads are safer.  I welcome the idea that everyone should be brought together on this issue.  I ask that the Minister of State confirm again that it is his intention to bring interested parties together, including the Road Safety Authority, to debate this issue.  He should do so now and not wait until three or four years time when more people will have died.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_133">The provision of roadside testing devices is at prototype stage.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in this regard.  I am aware such devices are available in Australia and wish they were the norm here.  The medical bureau is following up on the matter.  I look forward to these devices being accepted in Europe and recommended for use here.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">On administrative penalties, I had no hand, act or part in the matter which the Deputy said was covered in the newspapers last week.  I knew nothing about the matter until I read the article.  There is nothing new about administrative fines.  They are provided for in earlier legislation but are not yet being enforced.  We must decide whether a person found guilty of driving with between 50mg and 80mg of alcohol in their bloodstream should be disqualified from driving or awarded penalty points, which in some cases, depending on how many penalty points one has accrued, could disqualify a person from driving anyway.</p>

          his views on whether funding promised for sub-programmes implemented by his Department under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 will be delivered and implemented in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_138">The transport programme in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides for a total investment of €32.9 billion over seven years and identifies the Government's priorities for investment in roads, public transport, airports and ports sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">In 2007, expenditure under the NDP transport programme exceeded its projected level by €178 million.  The Exchequer provision for the transport sector in 2008 is in line with the projections used for the NDP.  I should also add that the funding provided for the first three years of Transport 21 is in line with the originally agreed profile of expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">The Government has repeatedly indicated that the national development plan, of which Transport 21 is a part, is its top priority and that, even in difficult economic circumstances, its objective will be to continue to provide the funding necessary to support its implementation.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_75">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_141">I thank the Minister for his reply.  Can the Minister give me a categorical assurance that there will be no change to the timetables of any of the programmes under Transport 21 and that none of them will be taken off the list?  In particular, will he refute the rumour in regard to metro north?  What is the position in respect of metro north, metro west and the Luas lines?  Will they be constructed as planned?</p>
            <p eId="para_142">The Minister stated that expenditure by his Department last year was on target.  However, in December 2007, the Minister moved €51.4 million from the public transport investment programme into other projects.  Will the Minister assure me that will not happen this year?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_76" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_143">I cannot give the Deputy that assurance.  The budget of almost €33 billion in respect of Transport 21 is a multi-annual package which ensures funding for a project which does not commence on time owing to planning delays and so on will not be returned to the Exchequer at the end of the year as is the position in regard to unspent departmental funding.  I cannot assure the Deputy that money will not be moved around within Transport 21.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">The sum referred to by the Deputy was taken from the public transport programme and reallocated to future projects under Transport 21.  The Department has an envelope of almost €33 billion which will be spent.  It is my duty and that of my Department to ensure moneys not spent in a particular area are reallocated to another area.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">The Deputy asked specifically if there have been any indicative changes to the timetables of metro north or metro west?  No such changes have been made, bearing in mind cutbacks in other areas and so on.  I have said on a number of occasions that the original timetable for Transport 21 is indicative.  Where issues arise, money will be moved around.  The completion date for the entire metro west project remains at 2014.  The project has been identified as a public private partnership project.  The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, indicated, when announcing the preferred route alignment, the possibility of it being implemented on a phased basis and this will be discussed with the prospective PPP bidders.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">The scheduled completion date for metro north is 2013.  This takes into account the additional planning work required by the scope changes made arising from the public consultation process.  The projected completion date for Lucan Luas is 2013.  An overlap between metro north and the DART extension might result in a delay in this regard.  However, the position is not yet clear.  I cannot provide totally reliable completion dates until the tendering process is completed.</p>

However, can he give us a categorical assurance today that no cutbacks or changes to timetables for construction will be made by his Department?  That is the key question, particularly in respect of metro north.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">Will the Minister state whether public transport projects outside the greater Dublin area, GDA, in particular, the western rail corridor, the €90 million for rural transport initiatives and new commuter rail services in Cork and Galway, will be delivered on time and on target?</p>

Notwithstanding the fact the Minister received the document only last week, this matter should be on top of the green city agenda and the green city for change programme.  We must get people out of their cars and into either public transport or electric vehicles as discussed.  Some of the key points the Minister might respond to are the use of bus lanes, free parking designated areas and, in particular, the recommendation concerning recharging stations where appropriate in centre city locations.  That would greatly encourage the use of electric vehicles.</p>

            <p eId="para_154">We received the discussion document last week.  Some of the ideas contained in it had already been submitted to the Department as part of the sustainable transport and travel action plan and we shall consider each one carefully.  Many of the issues mentioned by the Deputy are not directly within our remit.  Following the 500 submissions we received we are endeavouring to engage with other Departments, some of which will be directly involved, such as the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Finance and others.  We aim to produce a document that will highlight the best of these ideas.  The Deputy is right to say that the benefits of the electric car are very attractive from an environmental point of view and the matter will receive careful consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_159">All buses purchased by Dublin Bus since 2000 are low-floor and wheelchair accessible.  I understand from the company that over 72% of buses in the Dublin Bus fleet are now in this category.  This figure will increase each year as the bus fleet is replaced and expanded and all buses will be accessible by 2012 in line with Transport Access for All, my Department's sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">The Minister did not acquire a hybrid car so the House cannot really expect him to get an electric one although he is supposed to lead the way in these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">I understand that at the end of last year about 60% of the Dublin Bus fleet was accessible.  The target date is 2012.  Will that target be met?  The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, will have some knowledge about complaints in various parts of the city that some bus garages, for instance, Clontarf, did not seem to be getting their fair share of the new, accessible and most impressive looking buses by the end of last year.  Has the Minister spoken to Dublin Bus about this to ensure that the new fleet is brought into place throughout the region?  People with disabilities have suffered in this regard because of ideological reasons because there was no will to go forward with the additional fleet for Dublin Bus until the present Minister took office.  If that fleet had been renewed as the company wished it to be, we would now be much further down the road to full accessibility.  Is it not the case that the Government is responsible for opposing its own strategy on disability?</p>
            <p eId="para_162">People around the country have expressed concerns to me about the Bus Éireann fleet.  Some, including drivers, have said that although big, new impressive buses are now in use these buses are not completely accessible. There are difficulties with them although they have other strengths.  Does the Minister have concerns about the Bus Éireann fleet?</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_163">I do not agree with the Deputy's point.  The plan for roll-out of accessible buses is in accordance with the commitments given under Transport 21, the national development plan and transport access for all plan.  It is on time and living up to those commitments.  That document is out for consultation at present and the target date for its finish is 2012.  I have no reason to believe that we will not make that deadline.  Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and CIE are to be commended on the way in which they are handling transport access for all and my Department's sectoral plan and trying to implement them.  I join Deputy Broughan in complimenting them in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">The Bus Éireann city fleet in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford are all low-floor and wheelchair accessible.  There was a problem until recently concerning availability of accessible coaches suitable for inter-city and long-distance services.  The company had not kept pace with the availability of such buses for urban services so to a certain extent our country cousins were losing out as a result.  The reason for that was that coaches were built to allow for underfloor luggage space so that passenger entry was by way of steps and a narrow doorway.  That has now been rectified and accessible coaches are being manufactured and becoming available.  Since last year all  Bus Éireann coaches are accessible just as its buses are.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">There is an issue concerning bus stops about which there must be consultation with certain local authorities.  Perhaps the Deputy adverted to this matter.  Specific provision must be provided at bus stops so that low-floor wheelchair accessible vehicles may use them.  There is ongoing dialogue with some local authorities to try to ensure that this is done</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_169">I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 134 and 413 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">The rural transport programme, RTP, administered on behalf of my Department by Pobal, put the pilot Rural Transport Initiative 2002-2006 on a permanent basis from February 2007.  Reflecting the Government's intent for the programmed development of rural transport, Towards 2016 provides for increases in the annual RTP allocation over time to about €18 million and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 commits €90 million to the programme over its full term.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">My Department provided €4.5 million for the pilot rural transport initiative in 2005 and €5.1million in 2006. In 2007 €9 million was provided for the new rural transport programme and €11 million is being provided for the programme in 2008.  This additional funding is delivering greater frequency of existing services, much wider geographical coverage, and additional groups of passengers accessing rural transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_172">Funding is also available to the RTP from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of the free travel scheme. I understand that €750,000 was made available to the RTP in 2005, €850,000 in 2006 and €1.5 million in 2007.  I am informed that the 2008 allocation is €1.5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_173">I understand from the Department of Community, Rural, and Gaeltacht Affairs that its night-time rural transport scheme, which is also administered by Pobal, was set up in May 2007 on a pilot basis for one year.  However, the scheme has now been extended to end 2008 at which stage it will be reviewed.  I am informed that the initial commitment for the pilot year was €500,000 and that a further €360,000 has now been committed.  The local groups involved with the night-time scheme are also rural transport programme groups.  Their involvement, together with Pobal's, in both schemes ensure an integrated approach in areas where the two schemes are operating.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">Preparations for a pilot cross-Border rural community transport exercise in counties Fermanagh, Tyrone and Cavan under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council are progressing with a view to commencing the pilot service towards end 2008.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_88">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_175">Does the Minister agree that the funding provided for rural transport up to a year or two ago was absolutely derisory?  The amount is still incredibly small given the number of projects that could be supported.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">We have heard presentations at the Joint Committee on Transport, such as that of OK Community Transport, which covers Offaly and Kildare.  The Minister is supporting groups in west Cork and the Meath Accessible Transport Project, in addition to groups in Kilnaleck, Sligo, Donegal, and Laois.  Given that there is considerable interest in the programme, is the response from Government not derisory?  The Minister referred to the evening rural transport scheme.  Could he not establish it on a permanent basis?</p>
            <p eId="para_177">Do the problems associated with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs not constitute the other side to the debate on trying to support rural communities?  Would the Minister consider having a national system of targets to increase service provision such that an increasing number of rural householders would be within a tenminute walk of an hourly or even more frequent bus service, as in the United Kingdom?  Will he ask CIE and Bus Éireann to devise, with local service providers, a national network including every town and townland in an effort to provide the national public service network to which we are all entitled, regardless of where we live, be it at the tip of the Beara peninsula or just outside this House?  Is this area of his portfolio not important enough for him to take very significant action?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_89" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_178">I agree with Deputy Broughan that it is an important area of transport policy.  It is also an important area of social policy, including social inclusion policy, and local community policy.  I do not agree with him — it would not be strange for us to disagree on something or other — that the amount in question is derisory.  We put the scheme in place as a pilot scheme to see how well it would work.  Very often we are criticised for proceeding with grandiose schemes without first putting in place pilot schemes to determine whether they work in practice.  The scheme in question is progressing well.  I referred to the allocation of an additional €2 million this year, amounting to a total allocation of €11 million, the allocation of €9 million in 2007, €6 million in 2006 and €5 million in 2005.  The scheme is progressing in a very staged way and we are committed to it.  I hope, notwithstanding the financial difficulties we face, that we will continue to commit to it because I agree with the Deputy that it is extremely important.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">On the question of the night-time rural scheme, my answer is probably the same.  It is important that we determine how well it works.  Many of the rural transport projects fit neatly together and this is important.  I am not sure I agree with the Deputy that we should ask CIE, or Bus Éireann specifically, to start devising some scheme for a national network.  This is not to say anything against CIE because it has its own job to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">One of the strengths of the rural transport programme is that it involves local groups that know their local communities' needs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_182">I accept that, but if the operational decisions were decided in Dublin by Bus Éireann, or in Mitchelstown, good decisions would not be made either.  Doing so would introduce rigidities to the system that would not be good.  I know the Deputy is suggesting that the overall network might be good but this might defeat the purpose of what we are talking about.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">I would like to see further liaison between local groups and the HSE at local level.  This could be very helpful to the rural transport programme.  The HSE has a considerable budget for transporting people to hospitals, etc., and there have been very successful pilot schemes in respect of the rural transport programme in conjunction with specific hospitals.  This is one area in which I would like to encourage development.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_92">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_184">I welcome this debate.  There are two important aspects thereto, the first of which concerns people travelling to and from work.  In this regard, consider the unofficial, illegal park-and-ride facilities at Kilmoon Cross or at the motorway outside Drogheda, or at any of the areas where rural roads meet the motorways.  It is very much part of transport policy to encourage people to leave their cars at home or not to bring them into the cities, if possible.  Is it worth the Minister's while considering, with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the construction of properly equipped park-and-ride facilities, particularly in the counties around Dublin where unofficial facilities are being used?</p>
            <p eId="para_185">The second aspect of the debate concerns drink driving.  If we are to reduce the amount of alcohol people can have, the Minister should consider initiatives under the rural transport scheme whereby the local publican can be assisted, by way of VAT refunds or other measures, in purchasing a people carrier to drive customers home.  We should allow for new ways to sustain rural life.  The criticism we hear around the country is that rural life is changing rapidly and that the old way of life is changing even more rapidly.  The provision of rural transport, particularly to and from places of recreation at night, should be reconsidered.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_93" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_186">I will ask officials in my Department to talk to those in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about that point.  There is considerable merit in trying to use the rural transport system to link up to major arteries and other routes, and to the public transport system.  It is not possible to put buses on every single route.  We will consider the advocated approach in respect of the rural transport projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">On the Deputy's suggestion on the night service, the night-time rural transport scheme can form part of the review of the service.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been operating it on a pilot basis.  It will review it at the end of the year and that will certainly be useful.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_190">I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 123 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">In 2007, the NRA completed an updated feasibility study, which built on an earlier 2001 study, that considered, in particular, the costs and benefits of what has become known as the Leinster outer orbital route.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">The updated NRA study, which was forwarded to my Department in 2007, finds there is merit in an orbital route linking Drogheda, Navan, Trim and Naas.  Neither Transport 21 nor the national development plan provides any funding for such a scheme to be brought to construction in the period to 2015.  The Government has already made clear, under Transport 21, that priorities for the roads investment programme, after the completion of the major interurban network in 2010, will be the Atlantic road corridor as well as the improvement of other key national primary routes and the targeted improvement of certain national secondary routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">The Minister for Finance has indicated his determination to seek to avoid any diminution of the capital provisions already made in the period to 2015, notwithstanding the current economic difficulties.  The Leinster orbital route proposal remains an important potential element of our longer-term infrastructural development.  My Department will continue to liaise with the roads and planning authorities concerned to ensure that the route options are preserved free of impediment for this potential project.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_95">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_195">From the perspective of the Minister's constituency and mine, as well as north County Dublin, this critical route must be built because, as the Minister is aware, a major proposal has been made for a new port at Bremore.  It will be critical for the orbital route to be present to link together the transport links to remove all that traffic from Dublin city.  Moreover, wherever the hospital services are to be located in the north east, unless connections are put in place between Drogheda and Navan, Navan and elsewhere and so on, it will be very difficult to sell a new hospital in Drogheda or wherever it may be.  While this project is in the programme for Government, is it not the case that the Green Party opposes it?  It is holding back on it and the commitment in the programme for Government is solely that by the end of the Government's term, if it runs to full length, it will have in place the design.  No funding will be put into this route and, therefore, were the port to be built, it would not have the requisite roads to move the traffic outwards.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_196">As I have stated previously to the Deputy, I agree with his view that this will become an important part of the infrastructure for the north east, the north Leinster area and for the city of Dublin.  This is the reason I stated in my reply that my Department continues to liaise with roads and planning authorities to ensure that the route options are preserved free of impediment for the potential project.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">I agree with the Deputy that the development of the port at Bremore, which would be significant, will and should have an effect on the Government's thinking on the timing of this route.  While I believe the new hospital is critical for the north east, the absence of the Leinster orbital route should not delay the provision of the hospital in Navan as decided by the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_198">Has the Minister investigated whether the project might be facilitated by a public private partnership or otherwise?  Has he discussed it in detail with the NRA?  As the Minister is aware, the Green Party, and Deputy Cuffe in particular, recently stated this project was not part of the Government's strategy and would not take place while the Green Party was in Government.  Does the Minister or the Green Party speak for the Government regarding this important project?</p>

I am sure the Minister will also agree that, in this case, integral simultaneous development must take place.  In light of the previous speaker's comments, I hope it is the Minister who speaks.  He should give a commitment to the House that funding will be made available and that he will not follow the advice of the Green Party element of his Cabinet in this regard because it would have a highly negative impact on people.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Thomas McEllistrim — the need to introduce European studies, along with CSPE, as a subject at second level for the leaving certificate curriculum in Ireland; (2) Deputy Joan Burton — the substantial debt of up to €40 million owed by the Department of Education and Science to Fingal County Council in respect of school sites acquired on the Department's behalf; (3) Deputy Charles Flanagan — to raise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the consequences for the criminal justice system of the complete failure of our laws in relation to bail, notwithstanding legislative change and a national referendum a decade ago, the fact that crimes being committed by persons on bail have risen by 60% in the past four years — from 15,500 in 2004, 18,500 in 2005, 22,750 in 2006 and 24,200 in 2007 — and having regard to the fact that specific sections of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 designed to address shortcomings clearly are not working resulting in many known criminals continuing to engage in serious criminal activity while on bail and thus undermining the criminal justice system in the State; (4) Deputy Ulick Burke — the need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate his plans for the provision of a new school at Cahergal in view of the long history of delay in the provision of this much needed school where there is serious overcrowding and health and safety are serious issues following the announcement made early in 2007 on this matter; (5) Deputy Michael D. Higgins — the refusal to pay a higher education grant to an applicant in County Galway; (6) Deputies Joe Carey and Pat Breen — the need to fast-track the provision of a new school for Ennis national school, Ennis, County Clare; (7) Deputy Deirdre Clune — the need to ensure the level of breast cancer services currently provided in the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, Cork, is retained under the national cancer control programme; (8) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for Transport to provide an update on his plans regarding the reopening of Killucan railway station, County Westmeath, and the provision of Structural Funds financing for same in the light of the urgent need for easily accessible public transport due to the rapidly increasing population in the area; (9) Deputy Liz McManus — the serious concerns of local people about the hazards arising from a plan by Rentokil and South Dublin County Council to transport hydrogen cyanide from Ballymount for disposal at a Defence Forces facility at Manor Kilbride, County Wicklow; (10) Deputy Timmy Dooley — the need for the Minister of Finance to continue the interim arrangement at the Civil Service crèche at Ennis, County Clare, until a new contractor is ready to take over the running of the facility; (11) Deputy Ciarán Lynch — to ask the Minister for Health and Children if she believes that the best interests of the women of Cork are served by transferring the breast unit at South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital to an already crowded campus at Cork University Hospital where the treatment experience of the disease is far less and whether she considers that the closure of this unit, which is internationally acclaimed, in favour of a service which is as yet ill-defined constitutes progress for patient care; (12) Deputy Martin Ferris — the need to renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy; (13) Deputy Tom Hayes — the shortfalls in funding awarded to schools for capital projects; and (14) Deputy Seymour Crawford — to ask the Minister for Education and Science to consider the urgent need for a top-up grant towards the extension and alterations at Lisdoonan national school, Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, where serious unforeseen additional costs have occurred.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">In the midst of the business pertaining to the Lisbon treaty, to which I shall return later, I wish to bring again to the notice of the Taoiseach an issue of real concern for hundreds of thousands of people, namely, the cost of fuel prices.  Fishermen, commuters, small business, farmers and everyone else now are being screwed by the rise in fuel prices for diesel and petrol.  This is a real burden on everyone.  The cost of filling an average car is approximately €100, which is making life extremely difficult for a great number of people.  Members have seen evidence of the frustration felt by fishermen, hauliers, commuters on a daily basis, small businesses, farmers and so on.  Does the Taoiseach accept the Government is taking a real windfall from price increases, as it takes one cent for every increase of five cents?  What relief measures does the Government propose to implement to assist in the burden that commuters, small businesses, hauliers, fisherman, farmers and everyone else in the community now face?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_119">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_223">I explained the last time the Deputy raised this matter that the Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT, which is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  As Members will be aware, VAT receipts are falling and in a situation in which tax revenue is tightening, the Government cannot cut tax in any area without jeopardising funding for essential services.  It also should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is reallocated to petrol, diesel and other oil products and away from other VAT-liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there will be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I also must point out that businesses are entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel.  VAT incurred on auto diesel, for example, on marked gas fuel used in the course of business, is a deductible credit for business in the VAT system.  According to recent EU data, Ireland has the ninth lowest petrol prices and the 12th lowest auto diesel prices of the 27 EU member states.  It is mainly the newest member states that have lower fuel prices than Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">At their meeting earlier this month, EU Finance Ministers discussed the difficulties created by high oil prices.  They confirmed the agreement reached in Manchester some years ago that distortionary fiscal and other policy interventions should be avoided.  The fact is that reducing taxes on fuels would send the wrong signal both to consumers and oil producers.  We have to be careful not to exacerbate what is an already difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Any measures taken will have to be targeted.  Ministers met for over nine hours on the fishing industry.  We will examine what is an EU wide problem at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_227">That does not answer my question.  What relief measures will the Government put in place to assist people who are now really feeling the pinch?  I listened to a fisherman from Kilmore Quay talking about his €18,000 diesel bill for five days steaming, even though there may have been no fish at the end of it.  I spoke to a haulier in Cork who drove his lorry north of the Border and back, which took up 600 litres of fuel.  These costs are sometimes passed onto consumers, but commuters every day are now faced with rising prices at petrol and diesel pumps.  With price increases across the board, this is eating into disposable income at the end of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Does the Taoiseach agree with the projections that the Government will take in an extra €64 million in VAT because of the price increases?  Does the Government have any proposals to assist with the tax burden that is currently imposed on drivers?  This is a serious issue for hundreds of thousands of commuters on a daily basis, and the Government needs to do something about it.  They know the Government is taking in €64 million extra in VAT and they want to know if it can bring in any measures to alleviate the financial pressures being imposed on them.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">I am sorry but again I must point out that the VAT intake has been reduced, so I do not know where he is getting the idea that the Exchequer has seen an increase.  Overall economic activity has decreased because of the higher oil price, therefore the Exchequer take on VAT has decreased as well.  That issue was raised by a Fine Gael spokesperson in a press statement last week.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_232">The fact is that oil prices are higher due to rising commodity prices in general.  If we use the taxation system as a means of assistance, we will provide benefit to the producers and not to the consumers.  The benefit will go to those who are already getting a higher price for their product.  The Deputy is making the point that there is a windfall available to the Government, but that is not the case.  The overall reason for that is very simple.  If people have a set disposable income, while they must pay more of that on petrol than before, they still have only the same income to spend.  The fact that more of it is being spent on petrol does not mean that there is a windfall available to the Government, as the overall consumer spend is the same.  A greater amount is spent on petrol and that is what is causing hardship in certain sectors.  That is why there has been a meeting between Ministers and their representative bodies.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">It does not both ways.  It works the only way it can.  One cannot double count.  One can only count once.  The fact is that a greater percentage of consumer spend goes to those areas which have higher prices, but on the basis of fixed incomes, the same amount of money is collected by the Government.  Due to the higher oil prices, the reduction in economic growth rates means that the overall Exchequer take is down on those headings, as was pointed out by the finance spokesperson for Fine Gael when the figures came out last week.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_236">This country is now facing some very big problems.  We were in here earlier this afternoon talking about the aftermath of the rejection of the Lisbon treaty.  We are now probably facing the biggest diplomatic challenge since the Second World War.  Last week the live register went above the 200,000 mark.  We have seen the biggest increase in unemployment over the last year in 40 years.  Jobs are being lost in our economy at a rate of 235 a day, or 1,600 a week.  On top of that, there has been a great change in our public finances.  There was a €5 billion surplus two years ago, but there is a €1.5 billion deficit already this year.  Our economy is heading for a recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Against that background, it is unthinkable that the Government is effectively proposing that the Dáil be closed for public business for three months of the summer.  The Labour Party is proposing a motion in Private Members' business which would require that the House sit towards the end of July and return at the beginning of September.  The Government has tabled an amendment to that motion which effectively provides for one extra week's sitting for statements on the national development plan.  Against the scale of the problems we are facing, I do not think that is acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The people of this country are worried sick about jobs, businesses, rising prices and other problems.  Can the Taoiseach explain why we are going to up sticks in the second week of July and not do any public business until the end of September?  In circumstances where there has been a great erosion of confidence in political leadership in this country, does the Taoiseach not think that we ought to be here addressing the serious problems facing the nation, the consequences of last week's decision, and where we are going as a country?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_129">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_239">It is true that some of the economic scenarios referred to earlier in the year have come to pass.  We have had an international credit squeeze.  We have seen unemployment rise, although there are 200,000 people unemployed today in a workforce of 2.2 million.  The last time we had that figure, there were only 1.25 million people working.  Unemployment has risen to over 5.5% as a result of recent developments, which means there are challenges to the economy.  We intend managing the economy from a position of relative strength to ensure that we get through this period without doing any permanent damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">If we talk down the economy to a greater extent than the actual level of difficulty, that will lead to an erosion of confidence.  I was disappointed to hear an Opposition spokesperson talking about the dark days of the 1980s.  We borrowed £6 for every £1 we earned back in the 1980s, while more than 30,000 people emigrated.  At that time, 16% of the adult population had no job.  Inflation was at 21% and interest rates were over 20%, while the national debt was 125% of GNP.  Personal taxes were 40% at the standard rate and 65% at the higher rate.  Therefore, the suggestion that we are returning to the dark days of the 1980s on the basis of the difficulties we now face is, quite frankly, not a correct analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">By the same token, I am not suggesting that there are not considerable challenges facing the economy.  However, if the Deputy wants to talk about an erosion of confidence, then that sort of analysis would be best left aside as it does not reflect the situation we are facing at the moment.  We need to maintain our strength through this current situation.  There has been a reduction of €1.16 billion in the first five months of this year, as compared to the €1.5 billion referred to by the Deputy.  This is a development we shall have to address in terms of maintaining our budgetary discipline this year and planning our budgetary stance for 2009 and the year after.  The budgetary stance for this year provided us with a stimulatory impact on the economy of something in the region of 1.4%.  That is necessary in view of what has happened internationally, where many of the scenarios forecasted have come to pass.  There is no question of suspending our management of the economy on the basis of when the Dáil rises, whenever that might be.  We are talking about maintaining a responsible budgetary position, working in a disciplined fashion, setting out the situation for 2009 and the year after, which will prioritise our capital programme to get the greatest possible rate of return, putting in place the building blocks for the continued growth of the economy towards the better times ahead, and trying to consolidate the gains we have made through a disciplined approach.  That, however, has not been the analysis heard from the other side of the House in this regard.</p>

Neither do I want to see the type of terror we witnessed on the faces of families whose homes were about to be repossessed.  However, there is a difference between talking it down and ignoring it.  It seems the Government is in denial.  The economy is in a serious situation, and people are worried about it.  When people ask themselves what happened last week, I can explain it.  There is an apprehension in the pit of the stomach of the nation as regards how matters are going.  People are worried about their jobs, businesses, the country and their children.  They see prices going up every day and the €70 or more it costs to fill the car with petrol compared to €50, 12 months ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">There just cannot be a "business as usual" response to this, with the Government closing the Dáil and heading off into conclave to discuss Estimates and a budget over the period of the summer and early autumn.  This is public business that affects the lives of the people it and needs to be conducted in public.  I know there is a certain ritual every year as regards when the Dáil closes and the length of the recess and so on.  However, the problems the country face this year are such that it is irresponsible for the Government to close the business of Dáil Éireann.  The message we need going from here is not that Deputies are on holidays, but that the country faces serious problems and leave is cancelled.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_134">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_246">It is important to point out that the question of holding a debate on the European issue and the economy is something I should welcome during the course of this term, whenever it ends.  It is important to have such that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">In putting matters in perspective I am not suggesting we ignore the challenges, which the Government is very much aware of, but rather that we emphasise the need for a strategic approach as regards how to get through the present impasse.  As an open economy we cannot suggest that we can be immune from developments elsewhere.  Higher commodity and oil prices must have an impact on every economy.  How we deal with that, in terms of maintaining competitiveness, is not to suggest it is not happening by providing rebates all over the place indicating we can do this while our competitors do not.  That will not maintain competitiveness but postpones the day when we have to take on board the reality of higher oil prices impacting on the economy, the same as everywhere else.  It is wrong to believe this would provide a palliative or solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">It is one of the proposals that came from the Opposition benches and is precisely what we should not do because the benefit will not go to the consumer anyway.  The real issue involves continuing with the capital programme and investment, for example the approval in 2007 of €23 billion of investment under the national development plan.  This was not exclusively capital investment, but also current in trying to build up skills, invest in education, improve physical infrastructure, proceed with the public transport projects and make contributions as an offset, not full compensation, for the reduction in some aspects of private sector activity, particularly in construction.  This activity has to be maintained in an overall budgetary context that is sustainable.  It is true that as we face into this year and next, in particular, we will have to take whatever temporary adjustments are necessary to maintain a sustainable budgetary position.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">On the basis of our base of activity which has greatly increased in recent years, in health, education, social welfare or whatever, we are talking about hugely increased current investment as well as capital side expenditure.  We must maintain a capital spend commensurate with what is needed to continue to deal with the deficits in physical infrastructure, which have been historic because of the past unavailability of resources.  We must also seek to maintain budgetary discipline as well in respect of expenditures already authorised for this year — expenditures that were too great, according to the Opposition's critique.  Other Members, however, have said they were inadequate.  In fact they have provided a stimulatory impact equivalent to 1.25% of 1.5% growth.</p>

I find it absolutely inexplicable and astonishing that an issue of this importance should not be deemed suitable for the suspension of Standing Orders and a debate be held on the important issue of the Lisbon campaign and its future.  I propose that the Government sets aside Standing Orders and makes available Government time for a debate for the rest of the day, be it statements or whatever other process, on the Lisbon treaty, its future and where we are headed in our participation in the European Union, with the opportunity for Members on all sides of the House to give their views.

          <p eId="para_277">I agree with Deputy Kenny that there is an air of unreality about this.  Last Thursday saw one of the most significant decisions made by the country.  Now we have an Order of Business in front of us and a schedule for the week that proposes to blithely carry on regardless, with no debate on that decision.  This issue, as Deputy Kenny said, is being discussed in every capital in Europe.  If it is not formally on the agenda of parliaments throughout Europe, it certainly is being discussed by parliamentarians.  It is unreal and unbelievable that the Government has no proposal to discuss the consequences and aftermath of last week's referendum decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Are there plans to have a debate on the issue this week?  A proposal to have a debate tomorrow would at least be welcome.  The Taoiseach needs to hear the views and assessments, which may differ, of Members before he attends the European Council summit meeting later this week.  Earlier, there was only an exchange of questions and answers on the referendum decision.  The Taoiseach needs to hear some initial considerations on the issue and Members need to give their assessments.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">With the greatest respect, the Taoiseach appears to be in denial.  We have had an exchange about the economy but there is an air of denial about last Thursday's decision.  The Taoiseach must hear the views of Members who have got feedback from the people before he attends the summit meeting later this week.  If he will not do so this evening, I suggest he sets aside tomorrow for a debate on the post-referendum situation.</p>

It is an important step, however, it must be contextualised to reflect respect and acceptance of the democratically expressed will of the Irish electorate.  It cannot be a rehash of the debate or seek to lecture those who took a considered and specific stand on what the Lisbon treaty contained.  We would happily participate in such a debate.  I join Deputies Gilmore and Kenny in urging the Taoiseach and the Government parties to accommodate such a debate.  I hope when he attends his first Council of Ministers meeting as Taoiseach that the most important information he will heed is the decision of the Irish electorate.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">I assure Deputy Gilmore there is no question of being in denial about the result of the referendum.  We all know what the result is.  The question arose in terms of the European Council meeting, which will be held this week, coincidentally the week after the referendum.  Normally there would be statements in the House after a Council meeting.  If we held a debate then, we would have the benefit of the full gamut of discussion of what had developed.  It would inform a debate in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">I am very glad to accommodate debates on the European issue and the economy during the course of this session.  The House should debate those issues comprehensively.  If Members want a debate on the Lisbon treaty prior to my attendance at the Council meeting I have no problem with that and it can be fitted into tomorrow's business for two or three hours.  Since there will be no solutions or decisions at Thursday's Council meeting, I would have thought the normal procedures of a debate after a European Council meeting would have been more beneficial to the House.</p>

Earlier, the Taoiseach said we are now in a process of discussion and negotiation on the EU.  Obviously no decision will emerge this week or in the near future, but before the Taoiseach briefs other Heads of Government, it is important he understands that Members on all sides of the House have picked up the vibrations from around the country as to the causes of concern, anxiety and blockages in the democratic deficit, as it is called, between Ireland and Europe and between the Government and the Irish citizen.  It is in the interest of both the Taoiseach and the Government to have that discussion before the Taoiseach goes to Brussels so that he is exposed to the full range of people's views from all sides of the House, including his own.

The full gamut of what is intended for that site includes not only a prison — although this is the focus of the motion — but also the transfer of the Central Mental Hospital to that same site.  This is a very important matter.  It is proposed to guillotine the debate on this motion tonight at 10 p.m.  As it is tailored in motion format, it will not accommodate the full participation of all parties, as would be the case if it were the subject of statements.  Accordingly there is a need for an extension of time.  I ask that it should not be guillotined.  With three sitting weeks to go to the proposed beginning of the summer recess on 3 July, as has been the pattern every year, will legislation such as motions be guillotined in a mad rush to run measures through this House?  I oppose the imposition of a guillotine on this motion.

          <p eId="para_298">There is a difficulty regarding the time, in so far as the joint committee has risen less than one hour ago, when forced to do so by the Chair because of a previous order of this House.

They have waited on tenterhooks for the past nine months for some relief.

          <p eId="para_391">Very good.  I can talk a little more slowly therefore and maybe the Minister will not only understand me, but also take on board what I say.  The Indecon report, which was presented recently to Fingal County Council, stated that the metro north project had the ability to deliver 67,000 jobs to north Dublin.  In answering questions earlier, the Minister said that the project remains on line for 2013.  Is that correct?  He is nodding his head, so I will take that as a "Yes".  This is a key to delivering a hospital, possibly, and a third level institution to Swords, County Dublin.  The county manager is actively pursuing such commendable objectives.  The planners drawing up plans for a new city with infrastructure and transport amenities in the Swords area need clarity at this time of economic duress.  Now that the draft plan is on display, I hope timelines and so forth will be published soon.  Given Dublin Airport's expansion — a new terminal is under construction and a new runway is planned — metro north is badly needed.  Without it, developments at the airport will fall foul of a lack of infrastructure.  I hope the metro line proceeds on time.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I ask the Minister to reconsider the Bill, on which the House had a heated debate on the previous occasion.  While the legislation offers opportunities, it is vital that the new authority is answerable to the House.  We do not need another Health Service Executive, which is what the Dublin transport authority will be if the Bill is enacted as proposed.  The proposed authority will not be answerable to the House or anyone other than the Minister.  How will Deputies obtain information on behalf of constituents and citizens on issues on which the authority is not delivering?</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Deputies have spoken about the need for transparency and accountability, with which, I am sure, the Minister agrees.  However, he must also agree that if the Bill is passed without amendment, the new body will be neither transparent nor accountable and the disconnection between those who make decisions and those who have to suffer their consequences will increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">If nothing else, the result of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty showed that people are angry for a host of reasons.  While disinformation and other factors played a role in the outcome, the underlying and important message was that people feel disempowered and believe politicians are not listening to them and power is shifting to the centre.  The current approach does not work and undermines people's faith in democracy.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the arrangements provided for in the Bill to ensure the authority is subject to proper levels of responsibility, accountability and transparency.  Its staff must have a clear definition of what is their responsibility, to whom they are answerable and the reason decisions are made.  Moreover, the House must have an input especially as recent changes in the health system made the House irrelevant in that area.  If the Minister refuses to reconsider, I will oppose the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_395">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  A Dublin transport authority has been promised for many years and I am glad we finally have a Bill before the House which allows Deputies to discuss how we can develop a successful integrated transport system for the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The simple fact is that Dublin and its surrounding counties have suffered more gridlock and transport chaos in the past two decades than they should have suffered due to the lack of a single unifying transport authority for the greater Dublin area.  It is typical of the Government that we are getting our act together on this issue in the post-Celtic tiger era when massive expenditure on infrastructure may have to be cut back due to economic uncertainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The Dublin transport authority should have been in the leading advocacy role when planning the future of Dublin as part of Transport 21.  A single strong voice on transport in the greater Dublin area could have had a greater impact on halting the rampant ribbon commuter development of the past 15 years.  It is possible that, if a strong body such as the DTA had been established 15 years ago, we would have a more compact city of higher density, able to support a larger number of major public transport initiatives such as metro lines and fewer commuters spending many painful hours daily travelling to and from work.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">It is clear that a single unifying body in control of transport planning and issues in the greater Dublin area is required.  A body such as the DTA would be better equipped to take a lead in tackling issues, such as the gridlock which affects much of this city, than successive Fianna Fáil Governments and Ministers for Transport who, since 1997, have been unable to halt the increasing gridlock in the city, from which all of us suffer daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">In my constituency of Dublin South-Central, the Terenure, Harold's Cross and Kimmage areas are badly affected by gridlock and I probably receive more representations on this issue than on any other.  The area around Terenure crossroads experiences constant traffic jams but despite the efforts of Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council, Dublin Bus and others to put together a package to alleviate the problem, congestion remains as bad as ever.  Everybody in the area heaves a sigh of relief when schools close because a number of secondary and primary schools located in the immediate area contribute to gridlock.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">It is extremely frustrating for commuters who experience congestion at the point at which two major roads, Terenure Road West and Templeogue Road, converge.  While I accept, as a strong supporter of public transport, that the bus corridor from Rathfarnham has priority at the crossroads, congestion in this location causes unacceptable problems for those trying to get to work.  There has been no serious attempt to address the problem of traffic through Terenure or to establish a framework to improve matters for residents and commuters from as far away as Tallaght who use these two major routes.  Those who use the other major arterial route into Dublin, Harold's Cross Road, also experience gridlock virtually every day, as I do unless I leave home at 6.45 a.m.  At least I have the privilege of a degree of flexibility as to the times I can leave home.  Many of my constituents have no such flexibility because they are committed to a specific time schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I will wear my arts, sport and tourism hat to raise an important issue which must be addressed.  A recent Fáilte Ireland study showed that traffic congestion has a very negative impact on tourism and tourists' experiences in the greater Dublin area.  Tourism is vital to our capital's economy.  According to the Dublin Regional Tourism Authority, more than €1.6 billion was spent by 5.6 million tourists to the Dublin region in 2006.  We neglect the views and opinions of tourists at our economic peril, particularly given that Ireland is already expensive by European standards and suffers from unpredictable weather compared to many other European countries.  For these reasons, we must not give tourists further reason not to visit Dublin.  I hope, therefore, that a properly provisioned Dublin transport authority with significant powers will be able to tackle the city's gridlock and ensure a better experience for tourists and citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">It appears from figures emerging from the Department of Transport that target completion dates for projects under Transport 21 are being pushed out.  The critical link up of the red and green Luas lines has been stalled and the future of proposed Luas lines, such as that from Lucan to the city centre via Ballyfermot, is clouded due to the constrained fiscal climate in which the Government finds itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Recently, when I spoke on Transport 21, I showed constituents a map of the areas affected by the programme.  They pointed out a large area which looked a little like the Phoenix Park, in other words, it was blank.  This suggests Transport 21 will not offer much good news to my constituency, although there has been a proposal to route a Luas line through the constituency.  The proposed route has generated significant hostility because people are afraid the project will not impact positively on traffic flow and will take so long to deliver that it will be irrelevant.  It is imperative the Dublin transport authority is established as soon as possible to help steer these vital projects through the choppy economic waters we face and ensure value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The failure of successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Transport to deliver integrated ticketing has been a bugbear of mine for a long time.  Foreign tourists are also irritated to discover integrated ticketing is not in place in the greater Dublin area and anecdotal evidence suggests this results in a concentration of foreign tourists in the city centre.  They do not see the ease with which they can move into the suburbs and, indeed, out of the city.  If we had integrated ticketing, they would be more likely to use the various transport options — Luas, DART, rail etc.  Dublin is probably unique by comparison with European cities.  This integrated ticketing project has been in existence since 2002, but despite spending millions on integrated ticketing, the project has not been realised.  I hope that with the DTA this project will be moved forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">One of the reasons there has been difficulty in providing integrated ticketing is the lack of cross co-operation among all the major public transport providers in the greater Dublin area.  One of the important roles of the DTA should be to co-ordinate the delivery of such a project.  We should have had integrated ticketing in the Dublin area long ago.  There are reasons for this.  Its delivery is not a simple matter but it is so fundamental to encouraging people to use public transport that it must be seen as a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The keyword in today's transport planning is "sustainability".  This extends to the provision of houses, services and public transport.  Dublin's future transport development must prioritise sustainable forms of transport, commuting and living.  The ever-increasing price of fuel and the issue of global warming mean that commuting to Dublin from Gorey, Mullingar or Virginia will no longer be feasible on the scale it is currently.  This necessitates an overarching body to help plan the city's transport development across all modes of transport, public and private.  The Government has shown that it is not able to proactively manage and plan for the transport needs of the city and it is time the DTA was given the opportunity to do this on behalf of the people to ensure we have the sustainable forms of transport required for the Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I want to address the lack of co-ordination between planning in Dublin city and the need for a quality transport system.  A number of large residential developments have been allowed to go ahead in recent years.  I speak with some passion about my constituency where many of these huge developments have been allowed to proceed.  Leaving aside the other opinions I have on the merits of high-rise development, one of its knock-on effects is that the transport facilities in place are not nearly adequate for those living in those apartments, particularly in dense developments where there is a high level of occupancy.  There is nothing like an adequate level of public transport for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Second, often car parking facilities are put in place around such developments and that means that people, because they do not have access to public transport, are obliged to use their cars, the consequence of which is gridlock.  The planning department of Dublin City Council, for example, and the transport authority must merge to ensure that there is infrastructure to allow people to live in such high-rise densely-occupied apartments and at the same time have an adequate quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">One must consider the anger engendered by virtue of finding oneself blocked at the bottom of Jamestown Road, as will inevitably happen arising from another development in my area.  The local community very much welcomes the 300 affordable houses but it is extremely irritated by the fact that no account was taken of the knock-on effect in terms of the number of cars that will inevitably come out of that development and find themselves blocked at the bottom of Jamestown Road and on the Naas Road.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Anybody who knows the Naas Road will appreciate the difficulties along that stretch.  One of the positive aspects of transport has been the Luas line.  In my constituency, particularly in areas such as Drimnagh, Rialto and James's Street, it has been invaluable but the problem is that the capacity is far too small.  People tell me that when the Luas arrives in Drimnagh, for example, in the morning it is chock-a-block and one cannot get on.  The same happens at peak traffic times going home in the evenings.  There are limitations in terms of the number of carriages and so on, but these are the kinds of matters that should have been thought through.  The Naas Road is one of the areas served by the Luas line, which is a great service but it is not adequate to take the number of people using it.  When planning for those new apartments was being put in place that was totally ignored.  I ask for joined-up thinking in planning and traffic management.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I welcome the decision to publish the legislation that will finally set up the DTA and the Labour Party welcomes the prospect of a sustainable transport network and accessible public transport.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_412">I thank all the Deputies for their detailed contributions during the course of this wide-ranging debate.  I very much welcome the broad support among Deputies for the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority.  I reiterate my apologies to the Deputies for not being able to be here for the opening of the Second Stage debate because of an unfortunate clash with a North-South Ministerial Council.  I regret that but I read the transcripts of that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I noted carefully the contributions made on a range of issues during the course of the Second Stage debate and, although I may not be able to address them all, I will take some of those that were the focus of attention for various Deputies.  Most Deputies raised the issue of democratic accountability, in terms of the composition of the authority and the advisory council as well as the accountability of the authority to the Oireachtas.  I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Reilly's assertion that this is a HSE-type organisation.  The Bill contains a strong accountability framework which strikes a fair balance between efficiency and democratic accountability.  The Minister for Transport and the Secretary General of the Department of Transport will be fully accountable to the Oireachtas in respect of the DTA — as everybody here will be aware, the HSE has its own Accounting Officer.  The funding of the authority will be routed through the Department and we will be responsible and answerable for that.  In addition, the chairperson and the chief executive of the authority will be directly accountable to this House through the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Transport in respect of their various functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I do not disagree fundamentally with Deputies on the necessity that such organisations are fully accountable to the House.  However, in many respects the committees of this House do not exercise effectively their role as scrutineers of the actions of various bodies.  They tend to hold a couple of meetings a year on broad general issues and do not focus enough on the individual organisations.  A little examination of conscience on that matter by Members of the House on all sides would be no harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I have been criticised by some for having mention of "the Minister" approximately 186 times in the Bill and for the potential for the Minister to interfere too much.  On the other hand, I have been accused in the House of shedding all my responsibilities.  However, there is a strong accountability regime in place in this regard and I fundamentally disagree with that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">As part of the issue of accountability, a number of Deputies made suggestions on appointments to the authority.  I am afraid I am of the old school in that if a body is under the aegis of my Department or me, as Minister, I do not feel I should allow somebody else to make the appointments to the board of that authority because I must come in here to answer for it and account for what it does.  I am not particularly interested in ensuring that my hands, or those of any future Minister, are tied when it comes to appointments to the board.  One could get some very funny appointments to a board which might not care too much what the Minister might say or do at some point in the future.  Political accountability rests with me and the issue of appointments should rest with me as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">A number of Deputies raised a point about the advisory council, representation on the board and so on.  Deputies made the case very strongly that there should be more local public representatives involved in that, particularly on the advisory council.  I am looking at that and am disposed to accepting we change that and have greater local authority representation.  The idea of allowing a group, or groups, to make nominations to the Minister, who will appoint people to the advisory council, needs to be teased out because once one says a group should be entitled to a certain number of nominees to the advisory council, 75 other groups will say they should be allowed the same number.  I will keep an open mind on that on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Road Transport Act 1932 was raised by a number of Deputies, principally Deputies O'Dowd and Broughan, and the fact the Bill does not provide for the reform of the licensing arrangements for commercial bus services.  It has been suggested the absence of such reform means there will be no competition in the market for at least five years.  That is not the case and is a misreading of the situation.  Section 48 empowers the authority to procure public passenger transport services by way of public transport service contracts.  Contracts in respect of light rail and metro must be pursued by way of open tendering and public bus services may also be secured in that fashion.  Bus services can also be procured by way of direct award contracts in line with section 52 and a similar approach will apply in respect of the procurement of rail services.  It will be a matter for the Dublin transport authority to instigate the procurement of public transport services as it sees fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The Bill does not place any restrictions on the authority in terms of a time period as to when it might invite tenders for a new funded service.  The period of five years referred to in section 52 relates to the length of the initial direct award contracts for existing bus services provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann only.  The future growth of the market for subvented bus services will only be pursued by way of open tendering so competition is in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">As well as the commitment to establish a Dublin transport authority, the programme for Government also includes a commitment to improve bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions under the Road Transport Act 1932.  It is my intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislation.  It is too early to give precise details of the proposals but I can confirm that the new Bill will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 which relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">That new bus licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU PSO regulations.  It is envisaged that new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, and that the powers to grant bus route licenses in the greater Dublin area will be given to the Dublin transport authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The new Bill will also encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the greater Dublin area which are consistent with the EU PSO regulation.  I have dealt with a number of the points made by Deputies in regard to what might or might not arise in the Bill.  However, it is not possible at this stage to indicate a precise timetable as to when those proposals will be published but in the meantime, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I assure Deputies it is not my intention to delay this as I see it as a critical and crucial second step in the reform of the bus licensing regimes.  I intend to carry this out very quickly.  The fact Deputies and the Seanad have facilitated this debate means we may be able to bring this to a conclusion this side of the summer recess and that will help that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Deputy Broughan suggested there is an anomaly between the provision of a five year direct award contract for Dublin Bus and a facility for ten year bus contracts in regard to private bus operators.  By virtue of their exclusive nature, EU Regulation 1370/2007 which establishes a new framework for PSO contracts for bus and rail services provides that direct award contracts are treated differently to contracts which are the subject of public tenders.  The approach proposed in regard to the length of contracts, which is set out in section 48(6) is consistent with that regulation.  It provides that the actual determination of the duration of each contract is a matter for the Dublin transport authority within the framework of the maximum durations established in the EU regulation.  The specific timeframes are established only in regard to the first direct award contracts mandated under section 52 in order to ensure that when the subsequent direct award contracts are entered into, they will be fully compliant with the regulation.  The Bill does not establish specific periods for those subsequent contracts as that will be a matter for determination by the DTA in accordance with section 48(6).</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I refer to the other question the Deputy raised in regard to the operator of last resort and the protection of employees.  I do not propose to designate CIE as an operator of last resort for the simple reason that at this stage CIE might, in some case, fail to provide the type of service I, another Minister or the Dublin transport authority might want.  It would not be wise to make it an operator of last resort.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">In regard to the issues around the terms and conditions of employment, public transport operators are already subject to the relevant requirements of employment law and EU legislation.  Notwithstanding this, I understand the concerns expressed by the Deputies and will try to bring forward an amendment for consideration to address that issue.  As the Deputies will be aware, the issue is generally a matter which is discussed and decided at national level.  We cannot have a sectoral agreement in transport.  However, it is an important principle and we should in some way enshrine in the legislation that we expect minimum standards in this area.  Hopefully, we will have a suitable amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">On the question of extending the greater Dublin area, as Deputies know there is a provision in section 3(<i>c</i>) to extend the geographical area of the greater Dublin area by order of the Minister.  The Dublin transport authority can make recommendations to the Minister for Transport in that regard but I am not of a mind to change it at this point.  It would cause delay and a certain amount of confusion because we would be moving into an area in which another regional authority was operating.  Deputies are aware there is a provision in the Bill for services from areas, such as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern’s area of Drogheda, and so on, to be designated as GDA services.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I have been advised that the ability of the Road Safety Authority to appoint transport officers to enforce, <i>inter alia</i>, road transport regulations regarding driver hours etc., needs to be clarified in law arising from an inadequacy of language in the Road Safety Authority Act 2006.  Deputy O’Dowd was contacted by an official in my Department and we tried to make contact with Deputy Broughan as well.  I ask for the indulgence of the Deputies in the House in dealing with this matter on Committee Stage.  I look forward to their co-operation and I thank them in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I thank Deputies for their contributions.  As I indicated, I propose to bring forward several amendments in response to issues that have been raised during the debate.  I always try to approach a Bill on Committee Stage in an open manner.  If the Bill can be improved I look forward to working with Deputies from the Opposition to try to ensure we improve it on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_560">The draft resolution to approve the development of a prison in the district electoral division of Kilsallaghan is an important step in the delivery of real and substantive improvements in our prison system.  Mountjoy Prison, a Victorian prison built in 1850 for short-term convicts awaiting transportation to Tasmania, has to go.  The accommodation provided at Mountjoy Prison is substandard — there is no in-cell sanitation and it is overcrowded.  The constrained size of the site restricts the development of proper prison programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">A number of Deputies have drawn attention to the problems facing the prison system.  We are addressing those problems.  The construction of a new prison development at Thornton Hall is part of the solution and will be a major help in this regard.  It will lead to the end of "slopping out" at Mountjoy Prison.  It will replace the current substandard and overcrowded accommodation.  It will provide state-of-the-art prison accommodation and facilities for education, training and rehabilitation.  It is designed to gain the maximum rehabilitative benefit from having a collection of small institutions while maximising the operational benefits associated with larger prisons by having a single perimeter wall and a central stores and maintenance service.  New prisoners will be assessed when they are committed to the prison.  The risk they pose and the most appropriate regime to manage their future integration into society will be determined.  The most dangerous and violent prisoners will be assigned to high security facilities.  Those who pose less risk will benefit from a lower security regime.  As they progress, they can move to step-down facilities in a domestic-type setting.  The capacity of the new development will allow ringleaders and rival gang members to be easily segregated from one another, lowering the potential for inter-prisoner violence.  The physical lay-out of the prison will ensure a much safer and more secure environment than exists in Mountjoy.  Given its structure, there are difficulties in introducing mobile phone blocking in Mountjoy.  Furthermore the location of Mountjoy in the middle of an urban setting and on a crowded site makes it difficult to stop illicit materials entering the prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Access to the new prison development will be through a dedicated road running from the old N2 main road.  Extensive car parking and visitor facilities and a dedicated bus service will be provided.  As I mentioned, there are a range of different facilities provided.  Separate from the male adult prison and from one another will be a female facility and a dual purpose block reserved initially and on a contingency basis for 16 and 17 year old males.  Along with a central administration centre and stores there will be work training facilities, a library, health care, a gym and playing fields.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">In the 1990s, owing to pressure of numbers, the so-called revolving door mechanism was introduced with many prisoners being given temporary release simply to make room for new committals.  By 1996, 20% of the prison population were out on temporary release.  I am proud to say that as a result of action taken by Governments of which I have been a member this figure is down to a reasonable 6%.  If Thornton Hall is not built, there is a possibility that once again there will be severe pressure on our prison capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The capacity of Thornton is based on the outcome of a study on projected prisoner numbers for the period up to 2015.  While the projections envisage an increase in numbers, they project that our prison population rate per 100,000 inhabitants will reduce as our overall population increases faster than our prison population.  The development is designed to cater for 1,400 prisoners in single cell occupancy.  However, we must allow for the unforeseen.  Mountjoy Prison has been in use for more than 150 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The cells in the new development are designed to be large enough for double occupancy and the services are designed to cope with up to 2,200 prisoners without any major structural change.  For the purpose of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, it was necessary to take the most extreme scenario and hence the EIA cites a figure of 2,200 prisoners although, as I stated, the intention for the foreseeable future is to operate the prison with no more than 1,400 prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Obviously, today the focus is on prisons but let us be clear the new development at Thornton is not intended to be a signal that prison is viewed as the only, or even the most desirable, sanction to be imposed in respect of criminal behaviour.  It is the courts that ultimately decide on the numbers of people committed to prison.  The Executive has no direct say in the matter and the Irish Prison Service must accept and implement the decisions of the courts.  The vast majority of persons convicted of criminal offences do not receive a custodial sentence.  As I stated at the committee meeting earlier today, approximately 10% of persons convicted receive custodial sentences.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The courts make liberal use of alternative sanctions to custody.  These include fines, probation, compensation orders, supervision orders and community service orders.  When one compares the prison population rate per 100,000 inhabitants, Ireland has one of the lowest rates in Europe and just half that of England and Wales.  The Government's commitment to non-custodial sanctions is evidenced by a 30% increase in the size of the probation service, the establishment of the National Commission on Restorative Justice and the review of the community service scheme and by the bringing forward of legislative proposals on fines.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Turning to the amendment proposed by Fine Gael, I recognise that a constructive effort has been made to raise important issues about our prison system.  While I will be opposing the amendment, that does not mean I disagree with the intent behind some or all of the particular proposals.  I do not believe it is appropriate to try to tie down the management of a prison by means of what are in effect "planning conditions".</p>
          <p eId="para_569">As far as the specific points raised in the amendment are concerned I agree there is an urgent need to improve the quality of certain prison accommodation.  Indeed, this is the reason the Government is pushing for the prison development to proceed.  I agree the Irish Prison Service has achieved major successes with the Dóchas centre.  It is a fine building and it is unfortunate we will have obtained less than 15 years use from it when it is eventually closed.  Women make up a very small proportion of the total prison population, less than 4%.  While I do not anticipate any sudden upsurge in this regard, I again point out that it is the courts and not the Prison Service that decide who goes to prison.  Furthermore, approximately 60% of women offenders committed to prison are so sentenced for crimes involving violence or drugs and, for this reason, a prison is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The Dóchas centre is already the most overcrowded prison in the State.  On 1 May prisoner numbers exceeded bed capacity by 30% — women prisoners deserve better than this.  As I stated at the committee meeting, the Dóchas centre sticks out as a sore thumb in regard to bed occupancy.  We need more space and it does not make operational or financial sense to have two women prisons in Dublin.  The design at Thornton Hall takes full advantage of the best lessons we have learned from the Dóchas centre and applies them on a larger but still moderate scale.  It will provide single occupancy domestic style accommodation based around courtyards.  It will also include three separate sections which will ensure that, for example, women on remand remain separate from sentenced prisoners.  I also point out that at Thornton, women prisoners will be completely segregated from male prisoners and will be further away from them than they are at present in the Mountjoy complex.  The Irish Prison Service is committed to facilitating visits by family and children to both male and female prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Currently, 16 and 17 year old male prisoners are held in St. Patrick's Institution which is part of the Mountjoy complex.  Conditions there are not good.  The Government is committed to ensuring that persons under the age of 18 are not detained in the same institution as adult prisoners.  In March of this year the Government approved plans to develop new facilities at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin to provide detention facilities for 16 and 17 year olds.  It is a much smaller project than Thornton and the aim is to have these new facilities built and in operation before Mountjoy Prison and St. Patrick's Institution are closed.  However, planning is at a much earlier stage than Thornton and it is not possible to guarantee how the timing will work out in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The Government has a choice if the new facilities at Oberstown are not ready on time.  We can leave 16 and 17 year old prisoners in dilapidated and poorly serviced accommodation in St. Patrick's Institution or we can as a contingency measure move them to new purpose built accommodation in Thornton where they will be completely isolated from any adult prisoners in a manner which complies with our international obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">There are no plans to use Thornton to systematically detain asylum seekers.  Under the Refugee Act, asylum seekers may be detained in very specific circumstances, for example if a notorious war criminal seeks asylum, while their claim is being processed.  Furthermore, asylum seekers are not exempt from the criminal law and as with any individual they may be imprisoned if they commit an offence while in this jurisdiction.  The most common situation where a person may be detained for immigration reasons is the case of persons refused permission to enter the State or pending deportation.  There is a strict limit on the period for which they may be detained.  Currently, such persons are detained in a prison, normally Cloverhill, along with other prisoners.  The facilities at Thornton will be such that people detained for immigration control reasons will be accommodated completely separately from remand or sentenced prisoners in line with best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I can assure Members that in no circumstances can I contemplate any facility within the proposed development being an approved centre under the Mental Health Act 2001.  The proposal regarding the possible siting of the Central Mental Hospital, a designated centre under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, falls outside the scope of the Prisons Act 2007 and nothing in this resolution can affect that proposal one way or the other.  There is agreement on all sides that the existing Central Mental Hospital needs to be replaced.  I understand a project team established by the Department of Health recommended in 2004 that the Central Mental Hospital be relocated to a new site with ready access to the M50 motorway.  The Thornton site meets the specified criteria.  It is immediately available at no extra cost to the Exchequer and would free considerable sums of money from Dundrum for investment in the new Central Mental Hospital and other capital developments for mental health services.  It is for this reason the Government directed that 20 acres with its own entrance be set aside as a possible site for the relocated Central Mental Hospital.  I use the term "possible site" because the project has to go through a number of hurdles, including a cost benefit analysis, before a final decision is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Maintaining links with family and friends can be important for maintaining and rehabilitating prisoners.  For this reason visits and phone calls are facilitated.  Local management needs discretion to reconcile visiting with other needs, and arrangements vary.  In closed prisons visiting sessions are normally in the morning and afternoon on six days of the week.  In the training centre and open institutions, however, visits are often centred on Saturday and Sunday to avoid clashes with work and training commitments.  For these reasons I do not think it appropriate to impose specific requirements about visiting hours as part of a development consent condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I agree entirely that visitors dependent on public transport should have available to them a low cost transport service that ties in with visiting hours at the new prison.  However, I would not be willing to designate specific transport hubs at this stage.  We must consult with the people concerned and find out what their needs are before making this kind of decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The first priority for any prison service is to provide a safe, secure and humane custody.  I can confirm that our prison policy is and will continue to be informed by a rehabilitative agenda including education, training, psychological assistance and drug treatment.  The development at Thornton will enhance our ability to implement these policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The Irish Prison Service is committed to developing and rolling out a fully coordinated integrated sentence management system based on risk assessment and rehabilitative needs.  Education and literacy, in particular, will continue to be a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The Irish Prison Service drugs policy and strategy provides for a comprehensive range of treatment options.  As I mentioned at the outset, we are dealing with approval of a major prison under the special procedure under the Prisons Act 2007.  This is a more open, transparent and democratic procedure than the normal planning procedure for prison development.  The rapporteur received 130 submissions and his report identifies the main points raised in the submissions.  All the relevant documents have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Great care has been taken to ensure all the correct procedures have been followed and that due regard has been had to the environmental impact assessment, EIA, and to the results of the public consultation.  Although the prison system is an essential part of our social and rehabilitation structures the siting of a new prison is seldom welcomed by local residents.  Alterations were made to address the concerns expressed by those who made submissions where appropriate.  After consideration and the review of expert advice, it was decided the alterations were not material in the sense envisaged by section 24 of the Prisons Act 2007.  The development conditions regarding the resolution are partly in response to the submissions made to the rapporteur.  I will not go into the details of that but it is safe to say we have endeavoured to meet as many as possible of the submissions people made.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">We will provide vastly improved facilities in existing small-scale institutions but with the better services and economies of scale associated with larger prisons.  The development at Thornton will not be a magic bullet but it will radically improve our prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The resolution to approve this is worthy of support from all sides of the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_583">I shall read the text of our amendment which I moved last month.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_584">1. In the first paragraph after "in the County of Fingal" to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_585">"—that, to ensure the safety of prisoners and staff of the Irish Prison Service, there is an urgent need to improve the quality of certain prison accommodation in Ireland;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_586">that, recognising the existence of a new women's prison, Dóchas, the need for women to be held in a completely separate facility from men and held within easy access of visiting families and children to ensure community and generational continuity and support, women shall not be held in the facility at Thornton Hall;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_587">that the facility at Thornton Hall will never be used to house persons under 18 years of age;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_588">that the facility at Thornton Hall will never be used to house persons seeking asylum or protection from persecution;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_589">that no part of the facility at Thornton Hall shall constitute an approved centre for involuntary admission of persons suffering from a disorder under the Mental Health Act 2001;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_590">that the facility at Thornton Hall have visiting hours at weekends and in the evening of specified weekdays so as to allow maximum opportunity for visitation by families to persons detained at the facility at Thornton Hall;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_591">that the facility at Thornton Hall shall be serviced by a frequent and low-cost public transport service at all visiting times which must service the transport hub of Busáras and Connolly Station;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_592">that prison policy in Ireland be informed by a rehabilitative agenda which incorporates education, training, psychological assistance and drug detoxification as its core principles;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_593">that every prisoner at the facility at Thornton Hall shall have an integrated sentence management programme designed for him, with particular emphasis placed on reintegration into the community at the end of their sentence to include provision of short term accommodation;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_594">that every prisoner at the facility at Thornton Hall have access to comprehensive education and vocational training, with particular emphasis on literacy development for any prisoner; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_595">that every prisoner at the facility at Thornton Hall who suffers from a drug addiction have access to a comprehensive drug detoxification programme."</p>
          <p eId="para_596">We are back about two hours from the meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  The situation regarding this debate is less than satisfactory because issues arose on Committee Stage and must be dealt with now although the House will break soon for Private Members' Business.  It is a pity that this important issue is being rushed in such a fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I thank the Minister for his reference to the amendment and to the points he made in favour of some of it.  I regret he did not see fit to go further.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">With regard to the need to improve the quality of prison accommodation, that point is accepted.  We obviously support the relocation of Mountjoy and the need to invest on the capital side in our prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Regarding persons seeking asylum or protection from persecution, I note what the Minister said and I shall return to the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The issue of public transport arose on Committee Stage and I urge the Minister to be generous in his reply because it is important.  This was raised not only by me but by Deputy Burton and others in whose constituencies the proposed facility will be constructed.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I welcome what the Minister said in regard to prisoners' reintegration into the community at the end of sentence.  Perhaps before the end of the debate he might clarify that every prisoner will be part of that system.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">I also welcome what the Minister said with regard to the programme for literacy.  In the matter of drug addiction, it is regrettable that therapy is not provided in most of our prisons.  This gives rise to serious issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The current prison system is failing society due to the absence of comprehensive programmes of rehabilitation and the corresponding high levels of recidivism.  These rates are quite shocking.  Research suggests that half the prisoners re-offend within four years of release while 27% are back in prison within 12 months of release.  The taxpayer is footing a bill of between €95,000 and €100,000 per prisoner per year, maintaining what is in effect a revolving door system.  I accept, given the Dáil figures, that there will be a new facility, and given the intent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the fact that almost €40 million has already been expended that we can expect a prison at Thornton Hall in some form will go ahead.  That is the reality.  It must be underpinned, however, by appropriate facilities within the prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Our current prisons are in breach of international human rights standards, with particular reference to overcrowding and violence.  On occasion there are 990 prisoners in Mountjoy in a structure with maximum capacity for 930.  Dóchas currently houses 90 inmates on some nights, as the Minister remarked, and on some days up to 100 women, despite its maximum capacity being for 85.  If Mountjoy and St. Patrick's are coming to the end of their tenure and moving out why not extend Dóchas?  Why can we not expand and develop that site instead of moving people to Thornton Hall?</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Ireland's shameful record on human rights has been emphasised repeatedly by the Prison Chaplains' Association, the Council of Europe's Anti-torture Committee and by the prison inspectorate itself.  The Council of Europe's report into Irish prisons, published last October, described a scenario where inter-prisoner violence was rife, fuelled by the widespread availability of illegal drugs and the existence in our prisons of a gang culture.  Three prisons were singled out as being particularly dangerous in this context: Limerick, Mountjoy and St. Patrick's Institution.  The fact the latter is a facility for young people makes the findings of the Council of Europe report all the more stark and shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Figures published towards the end of last year indicate that more than 770 prisoners were under protective custody for their own safety in prisons nationwide, out of a total prison population of about 3,000 people.  In the meantime, last year an average of one prisoner per month died while in custody as a result of a drug overdose, murder or natural causes.  This is totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">In their most recent report the prison chaplains state the misuse of drugs continues to be a major problem in most of our prisons.  Many people have been introduced to drugs initially while in prison.  Surely the Minister will agree this is a shocking state of affairs.  I recall comments in this regard by one of the Minister's predecessors, Mr. Michael McDowell, who indicated that drugs in prisons were becoming a thing of the past during his reign, which was not too long ago.  It is a shocking indictment of the prison system that those who enter it without a drugs problem can actually acquire one by the time of their release.  Prison chaplains point to the fact that drug offences are actually the reason many are incarcerated in the first instance.  In this context, the limited and <i>ad hoc</i> availability of drug treatment programmes within prisons is a national disgrace.  Only nine prisoners at a time can avail of a special six-week addiction treatment programme in Mountjoy Prison.  Prisoners seeking drug-free landings to help combat their addiction are denied the facility due to chronic overcrowding.  I hope this will be addressed in whatever new facility is constructed.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The last report published by the late Mr. Justice Kinlen before his death stated the prison system was dysfunctional and lacking in educational, psychiatric and rehabilitation services.  It is unacceptable to proceed to build Thornton Hall as a super prison with 2,200 places in addition to the 3,300 or 3,400 currently available.  We have the highest prison population in the history of the State.  Are we to turn to the new facility into a super sized crime academy in which prisoners are locked away without any effort being made to lure them away from a life of crime?  The prison at Thornton Hall must be part of a new approach to prisoners, characterised by a focus on rehabilitating every one of them, including serious criminals.  The new prison must not become a centre where current dysfunctional trends are permitted to magnify.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Fine Gael supports the construction of a modern prison complex subject to the following important conditions, some of which I accept the Minister has addressed.  There should be a comprehensive programme of rehabilitation with the aim of offering a rehabilitation service to every prisoner so as to cut recidivism rates substantially.  There should be clear targets that can be revisited regularly.  Education and training should be available to all prisoners in the State, irrespective of whether they are in the prison at Thornton Hall or Portlaoise, with particular emphasis on literacy programmes.  The latest research suggests 65% of prisoners nationally are illiterate, while 50% of young offenders in St. Patrick's Institution are illiterate.  We need an integrated sentence management programme for every prisoner.  The Minister has indicated this will happen and I welcome it.  The existing drug detoxification programmes should be readily available to all and the programme should benefit from ring-fenced funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">We are facing substantial financial cutbacks, as the good days are over.  The Celtic tiger is dead, as the Minister admitted during the interregnum between the change of holders of high office.  We want to ensure there will be no cutbacks in prison education services.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">What is the position on the Fines Bill which, according to the Order Paper, is before the Houses?  However, it is not actually before this House or the Seanad.  I do not know where it is but it must be resurrected and passed to address anomalies associated with the prisoner population.  The latest official figures, those for 2008, show there are more inmates in prison for theft and shoplifting than there are for violent crimes such as murder, manslaughter and sexual offences.  There are 647 people in jail for non-violent offences relating to property.  This compares with 226 for murder, 82 for manslaughter and 230 for sexual offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Adequate staff must be provided to ensure safety and build bridges between prisoners and staff.  The Government must ensure the provision of a frequent public transport service from Dublin city centre to the prison and also its visitor centre, which should be a modern building with refreshment facilities for those visiting their family or friends in prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">We need a commitment to increase dramatically the funding for the probation and welfare service and ring-fenced funding for projects such as Linkage, an important and positive development.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to develop the restorative justice programme, on which I look forward to receiving the final report which I understand may be forthcoming this year.  I hope we can debate it in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I heard what the Minister said on asylum seeker detention.  He used the word "systematic" in a systematic way and is attempting to speak out of both sides of his mouth.  Will there be on the Thornton Hall site a holding centre, detention centre or unit for asylum seekers?  The use of the word "systematic" is direct and deliberate on the part of the Minister.  It is against international best practice to use a prison building or jail campus as a holding centre or detention unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">I have many questions for the Minister.  Is there a facility, whereby my questions can be allowed later, as they give rise to certain issues?  For example, there is a reference to the Central Mental Hospital not being "within the site" of the prison.  This is a clever statement but we must ask whether the hospital will be adjacent to the site.  With others, I would have a difficulty with this.  Local concerns were not dealt with adequately at meetings of the committee but need to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">We discussed the issue of designing, building and maintaining the facility at a meeting of the committee.  What private sector involvement will there be, if any, in the management, running and maintenance of the prison?  The State should retain total control of whatever building is constructed.  This is a most important issue that we did not have time to discuss at the meeting of the committee.  I beg the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence such that we might revert to the matter between now and the close of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I ask the Minister to take on board my concerns and ensure there will be a prisons policy, separate from the current <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements, that will allow us to adhere not only to national best practice but also to international standards.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_621">The message of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights states the committee has completed its consideration of this matter.  I am bound to say this is a parliamentary device designed not to mislead the House but to reassure it that a large number of committee members were gathered in silent scrutiny of this proposal for a very long period.  However, that is not what happened at all.  The truth is that it cannot be said the committee had completed its consideration because it was really only getting to the heart of the important issues when its work had to be abridged and a report made to the House, purely because, for some reason I still do not understand, the use of the guillotine is promised in the House at 10 p.m.  Although this project has been hanging around for a long time, members only received some information in this regard in the middle of May.  Due to the legislative load on the committee and the Lisbon treaty referendum, the committee has not had an adequate opportunity to consider the issues involved in the biggest prison building programme since the foundation of the State.  It is important to indicate that it has not had the time necessary to do justice to a project such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The unusual provisions of the Prisons Act effectively require the Houses to function as the planning authority; otherwise it constitutes exempt development.  While there has been much criticism of those elected brethren of members who function in planning authorities, were they to function as committee members have in this case, they would be charged with being in dereliction of their duty.  Members did not have time to hear from those who have an input to make into this project in the fashion they would have liked.  People were ready to make considered statements to the committee and its members were not in a position to accommodate them.  The committee was obliged to shorten the time available to those it did hear and it is fair to state they raised points that appeared to be at direct variance with assurances the Minister had given to Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The committee did not, for example, have the opportunity to hear from any established criminologist and did not hear any academic submission in this regard.  Although major statements of policy are predicated on this major building programme, the committee was unable to hear from them.  It had inadequate time to examine the compatibility of what was planned with modern thinking on penal reform.  The committee did not have adequate time to tease through the considered submissions received from residents' associations and people on whose lives this prison project would have a direct impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Moreover, the committee did not have adequate time to assess the implications of the great expenditure for prison provision.  For example, does it mean that members are acquiescing in the inevitability that the prison population will continue to grow and that they merely are providing for better facilities in which to bang them up?  Many would have liked members to tease through this issue.  I accept the Minister has moderated his language in his latest contribution in the House.  The remarks he made at the committee were intolerant of the submissions made by those whom he described as purporting to care for prisoners.  His statement in the Chamber was a softer version and I welcome some of his comments.  However, on a project as big as this one, the level of scrutiny remains inadequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I accept that to protect citizens and enforce the rule of law, some must be detained in prison for their safety and that of society.  This is inevitable.  I also accept that Mountjoy Prison is unsuitable and that the Victorian conditions applicable there are not good enough in the 21st century.  However, I am not satisfied that Members have had an opportunity to discuss what non-custodial measures are available in our approach to prison provision and those who should be in prison.  I am not satisfied that members have had sufficient time to consider whether there are people in prison who should not be there in the first place.  I am not satisfied that they have had time to consider whether there are pathways for the reintegration into society of those who come out of prison.  I am not satisfied that the prisons are functioning.  They seem to be a kind of giant FÁS scheme for the training of more professional criminals.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">I am worried that the massive public expenditure on the provision of prison places will be at the expense of other matters.  For example, will the budget for the probation and welfare service be affected as a result of such massive expenditure?  I am at a complete loss to understand the mindset that stated there was an obligation to conceive this project and purchase the site in secrecy.  I made some remarks in this regard on a previous occasion and do not wish to return to the issue.  However, it is remarkable that members found themselves with a <i>fait accompli</i> regarding the purchase of a site at what would be considered a remote location and at a cost that, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General, was twice the market value in the area.  Moreover, the cost was much more than twice the market value, according to experts in the land business and some of those familiar with the area.  Nevertheless, apparently, the belief is that because this is a prison and because that is the nature of the business to be done, one could not let the public know.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">It is more important that it was considered necessary to shut out the advocates of reform when furthering the proposal.  I cannot discern the reason the only people who are allowed to make an input are those who are on the inside.  I refer to advocates of reform, however much of a pain in the backside they might be regarded by some in the Prison Service who have an unpleasant job to do and no doubt do so to the best of their ability.  Why do these pains in the neck not receive a platform to make their input into the configuration of the new prison?  I refer to the design of cells, the nature of the activities for rehabilitation and education and training and similar issues.  Why must it be the conception of insiders only?  Why can those well known advocates of reform who interface with the prison population, have devoted much of their lives to working with prisoners and know about prisons not be heard?</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Speaking of experts, I would like to hear from the Green Party as its members were experts.  While I do not suggest the Prison Service or the Minister would regard them to be part of the pain in the neck category to which I referred, they are experts.  The new leader ridiculed the idea and thought the former Minister, Mr. McDowell, was not the kind of fellow one could let out alone to buy a piece of land.  He has waxed eloquent in this regard.  The former leader, Deputy Sargent, pledged to oppose it in the House.  He met the affected residents and told them he would oppose it in the House.  In fairness to democracy, the opportunity ought to be afforded to him tonight to express such opposition so as to be able to keep faith with the residents to whom he gave that undertaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The experts — the people at the coalface who interface with prisoners — are unhappy about the direction that has been taken.  The residents in the area are unhappy about the manner in which their fears have been taken into account.  The voluntary organisations which provide many of the services such as counselling, rehabilitation programmes and so on are unhappy about the implications of the decision for their continued involvement.  For example, people involved with the Dóchas project are unhappy and do not know why it has to be relocated out of the city to Kilsallaghan, with all of the implications for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">We met the residents, although we were not able to give them adequate time.  They have made voluminous considered submissions to us about things like water, sewerage, light intrusion, the height and width of the wall and so on.  We were not able to probe these submissions because we did not have the time.  The Minister has not responded to that.  In fairness, he could not have done so with the time available to him.  I would like him to confirm that he is willing to meet representatives of the residents to deal with some of the issues that concern them.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">Speaking of secrecy, I would also like to hear him discuss the state of Government policy on the Central Mental Hospital.  Until now we have proceeded in this debate on the basis that it involves a different Department, whereas people working with the Central Mental Hospital are absolutely persuaded that the Government has resolved that because it is stuck with 150 acres — the former Minister, Michael McDowell, was only asked to buy 80 acres, but he came back with 150 — it must find a use for that land.  It seems clear that phase two will be the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital.  It is not good enough for the current Minister to state we will have to put down a parliamentary question to the relevant Minister of State.  He will not tell the House whether it is the Government's intention to relocate the Central Mental Hospital.  It is like asking the Minister questions about the preferred bidder, as we did at the joint committee.  The Minister has always been very touchy about this, and one would not need to mention anything about a developer to him.  I do not question the fact he would never say hello to a developer.  He stated that if I wanted to find that out——</p>

          <p eId="para_633">Or even promoters for developers out of his own stable.  He stated that if we wanted to find that out, we should go to the National Treasury Management Agency.  I think the Government should tell us about its position.  Is it the case that Bernard McNamara has been selected?  Is it the case, given the controversy that has unfolded with Dublin City Council, that he does not have the capacity to deliver this project and that we will be picking up the pieces later in the year?  The Minister has avoided questions on this issue and he has avoided questions on the Central Mental Hospital.  There have also been many questions from the residents.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Senator Joe O'Toole stated that when the residents came into the committee meeting, the Minister's party colleagues were careful to put on the record that they opposed the prison.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien told us of his record of opposing it on Fingal County Council and why he was so worried for the residents.  Senator O'Toole pointed out that no Members from the Government parties were in support of this project.  We were left wondering who actually is promoting the project.  It seems that it was left to the unfortunate civil servants to carry the can, because Fianna Fáil and Green Party backbenchers are not supporting it.  Nobody supports it, according to Senator O'Toole.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Mr. Jimmy Farrelly did a useful exercise, but it is only an exercise in explication.  He was brought in to go through the countless filing cabinets of submissions that were made and to synthesise them into an accessible document.  He did that, but he has not expressed any view.  Some of the views he interprets for us are very supportive of the views that we have advanced from this side of the House.  The Minister was less than sure-footed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_638">If I may say so, Deputy Rabbitte had his tongue in his cheek when he quoted the eminent Senator, but he still did it in his usual dry fashion so one is not quite clear what exactly he meant by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">In a general sense, I would welcome a purpose built prison to replace the prison built in 1850.  We have read many articles over the years about slopping out and other poor conditions in Mountjoy.  The conditions are wrong and have given rise to great rebukes in the hallowed halls where these things are discussed, especially the UN, about the way our prison service functions.  However, given that such a large prison is to be built, there is an opportunity to infuse it with passion and commitment.  It should not be just a prison into which people are put and out of which they will come, no whit better in their manner or disposition towards civil society, or in any way improved in their character.  It is also a chance to improve the way in which the whole prison service is managed and to look at the area of restorative justice, as well as the community service scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I recently put down a question in the House about the community service scheme, and the Minister told me a report on its review was due shortly.  When is that report due and will we be debating it in this House?  It is important we should do so.  I always felt that the scheme should be used much more frequently and much more creatively.  I have never yet met a person who has been on a community service scheme, but such an idea is a good one.  If it is reviewed properly, we will know what role it has played in the lives of those fined in the courts.  Of course judges hand down sentences they think are correct, and I agree with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The Minister stated that women occupy 4% of prison space, which is small.  He stated they are generally imprisoned for crimes involving violence and drugs, so a prison sentence is needed.  A few years ago, the then Minister showed female Members of the House around the Dóchas centre in Mountjoy.  I was taken by the open aspect of it and I felt that women would feel safe in that prison.  I do not see why that centre has to go to Thornton Hall and I feel it could remain in its current location.  I know the Minister has given assurances about the separation of males from females, which is welcome.  However, the Dóchas centre in its inner-city location is near to many of the women prisoners' families.  Many of them have young children.  Its close proximity was suitable for families, for constant visits from young children, enabling them to meet their mother.  The Minister might look again at the Dóchas initiative for women prisoners.  The Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice recently brought over Baroness Corston — author of the Corston report — to give a lecture, to which the Minister was invited.  She spoke about the review she had carried out on women prisoners in the UK and the findings.  There may well be a case for retaining Dóchas where it is, rather than shipping everybody out to Thornton Hall, making that into a giant complex.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Minister has said the transport services will be frequent and reasonably priced.  They would need to be.  It is very easy to get to Mountjoy.  Despite all its material disadvantages, there is easy access for visitors.  The relative inaccessibility of Thornton Hall will be a major stumbling block, if it is not attended to.  I suggest an official should give attention to visiting services and accessibility.  The Minister talks of a low cost transport service that will tie in with the visiting hours, but he is not willing to designate specific transport hubs at this stage.  That is fair enough, but an official should be dedicated to investigating the required transport arrangements to ensure that people are able cheaply to visit those of their family and friends who are in custody.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The Minister gives the main points that the rapporteur has come back with from his consultation with the local residents.  I have not met the local residents at any time; I have just read what they are saying and doing about the whole matter.  I expect they have made submissions to the committee.  Deputy Rabbitte has said they did not have enough time to go through them in a comprehensive fashion, as they would have wished.  Nonetheless, I trust in the wisdom of the Minister and his Department to ensure that, in the main, the physical design of the building as it progresses will best tie in with the needs of the local residents.  We have all, in a small way, dealt with planning regulations for houses etc. and in general those physical matters can be attended to without too much difficulty.  I hope that will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">I reiterate that I wish to see the publication of a full review of the committee services scheme, to see what it says as regards the efficacy of such a scheme and how it can be sharpened and made more suitable to the location and those going into it.  I am quite sure the National Commission on Restorative Justice will issue a report.  I do not recall when it was set up, but it is not that long ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The existing women's prison at Mountjoy is a lovely building which has been only 15 years in existence.  I wonder whether any report has been done on the operation of Dóchas and what effect it has had on women prisoners, how they have fared coming from it, and whether restorative justice has been prevalent within its confines.  I ask the Minister and his officials to look again at the possibility of keeping Dóchas in its present form and at the non-implementation of the proposed women's prison at Thornton Hall.  For reasons of ease of access for families and for the prisoners themselves, and as a better custodial method, it ranks very high and it would be wrong to lose it to the Prison Service.</p>

          <p eId="para_661">I have before me Patients not Prisoners, a report on the Central Mental Hospital round table meeting on 30 January 2008.  I intend to read why it is opposed to the Central Mental Hospital being located adjacent to a prison.  This is something I spoke out about even during the last general election.  It is wrong, retrograde, impinges on people's rights and stigmatises people with mental illness.  God knows mental health has been the Cinderella of the health service in Ireland for generations and continues to be so.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Only recently we have seen the allocation of funds for A Vision for Change being reallocated to other areas of activity in the HSE and people with mental health put to the back of the queue again.  Similarly, the co-located hospital at Beaumont, a private initiative involving the  Government, was to be put on the site of the psychiatric outpatients' facility for Dublin north.  The facility, which got planning permission in 2004, was put out to tender in 2005, and now it has been put to the back of the queue.   This is an opportunity for the Minister and his Government to give a different message to people with mental illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The report is opposed to the move of the Central Mental Hospital adjacent to prison site on the following grounds:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_664">1. It will impede rehabilitation: The rural location and lack of community of Thornton Hall will act against the reintegration and rehabilitation of patients into society and the workforce.  Recovering patients will not have the easy access to education, training and social facilities that are so readily available from the Dundrum site.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_665">2. Increased stigmatisation of the mentally ill: The physical location of the proposed new Central Mental Hospital on the site of the new prison will inevitably and irretrievably associate those with severe and enduring mental illness with criminality.  Those using the hospital are patients, not prisoners.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_666">3. Social isolation: The proposed move to a site in Thornton Hall will serve to isolate the Central Mental Hospital from a community environment.  The Dundrum setting has enabled the patients to integrate slowly and safely into the community by providing a friendly and welcoming environment in which to shop and avail of local facilities on a daily basis.  Dundrum village has grown up around the hospital. It is part of the community.  The proposed new site is in a rural setting with a dispersed population and is not well serviced by public transport.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_683">It is proposed in the motion that Dáil Éireann should not adjourn for the summer recess until 24 July at the earliest and return in early September.  The country faces four major problems, the first of which is the economy.  Once the pride of Europe and the envy of the world, the economy is now heading towards recession.  In the past year unemployment has risen by the highest numbers in 40 years, breaking through the 200,000 mark.  Prices are increasing, while economic growth is down.  Related to the economic problem are the changed fortunes of the public finances.  Two years ago the State had an Exchequer surplus of €5 billion.  This year it has a deficit of €1.5 billion.  Departments are working with the rulers to identify where cuts will be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Following last week's decision in the referendum, the country faces its largest diplomatic challenge since World War II, as we find ourselves in a new place in our relationship with the European Union.  The final challenge the country faces — a factor in the referendum outcome — is the erosion of confidence in politics in the past ten years.  A decade of revelations about Charvet shirts, bets on horses at race meetings that never happened and other cock and bull stories at tribunals are eventually settling not just those who were culpable but the body politic as a whole.  In the circumstances it would be unthinkable and irresponsible for the Dáil to suspend public business for three months.  The Government in its amendment to the motion proposes an extra week of sittings — an extra week of statements on the national development plan, with no parliamentary questions, Order of Business or Leaders' Questions.  No normal parliamentary exchange for this long week of extra sittings is simply an unacceptable alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I know every year there is a discussion about the summer recess and, to a certain extent, the general arguments are well rehearsed.  The Labour Party has consistently argued for a lengthening of the Dáil's sitting year, one of the shortest in any parliament.  The last year for which comparable figures are available is 2005 when Dáil Éireann sat for 92 days; the House of Commons for 133 days; the US Senate, 159 days; the US Houses of Representatives, 140 days, and the Chamber of Deputies in Italy, 159 days.  Against this, the argument is made that no Deputy takes a holiday but works in his or her constituency while the work of the important Oireachtas committees continues until the end of July.  I accept this is true.  Any Deputy who takes a three-month holiday is unlikely to remain a Deputy for long, particularly in the highly competitive electoral environment in which we all must survive.  However, the long summer recesses taken by the House invite a public odium on the way in which it does its business.  Apart from the public odium it attracts, this year, more than any other, there is an unanswerable case for keeping the House in session and conducting the business of the Government in public.  The message from the House must be that Deputies are not going on holiday because matters are serious and leave is cancelled.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">For months the Government has sought to ignore the deterioration in the economy.  Earlier today I was struck by the degree of denial in the Taoiseach's replies to questions on the economy.  It is as if he does not get the message the rest of the country has received.  The Government has sought to ignore the accumulating facts; where it cannot avoid them, it blames someone else.  That simply cannot continue.  We must address the pressing concerns that are creating much uncertainty and hardship among the people.  For months there has been mounting evidence that Ireland is facing into a recession.  The scale of the slump in house building, of the Government's own making, is such that it could drag us into a position where there will be no growth this year.  Davy Stockbrokers expects 45,000 houses to be built this year and only 29,000 in 2009.  As a result, the Central Statistics Office reports its index of construction employment is down by 14% in the year to April.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The downturn is no longer confined to construction.  Strong evidence is emerging that expectations are falling across the economy and consumer sentiment is taking a hammering.  The volume of retail sales fell in April by 3.2% when compared to that in April 2007.  The ESRI index of consumer sentiment has been falling rapidly.  Sluggish consumption growth has serious implications for employment, especially in the services sector.  Unemployment is rising, with the live register increasing by 48,000 in the past 12 months.  Since the beginning of the year, the number signing on, seasonally adjusted, has increased by 235 each day.  That is the equivalent of a factory closing every day of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">All this has had serious implications for the public finances.  It has been made much worse by the manner in which the Exchequer was allowed to become heavily dependent on the construction sector.  Tax revenues for the first five months of the year were approximately €1.5 billion below those in the same period last year and €1.2 billion below target.  It is clear the budget forecasts published last December are redundant, as is the economic strategy which underlay them.  What is required is that the Government come to the House with a new set of budgetary tables that reflect the new realities and propose a set of actions to address them.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I do not underestimate the scale of the Government's problems.  All Members must acknowledge that the public finances must be returned to a sustainable path.  However, if the Government acts too quickly, it runs the risk of making the problem worse.  What is required is that confidence be restored by a restatement of economic policy, including a statement of how, over several years, the public finances can be brought back into good order.  The cold language of the public finances, however, will not express what all of this means for hard-working men and women and their families.  It means hardship.  It means worrying about how to pay the bills and meet mortgage repayments.  A report published yesterday showed that 37% of people found it difficult to meet their daily bills.  Another report today shows the extent to which people on low incomes are facing real fuel poverty.  We know of the pressures on people in dealing with accumulated loans that must now be repaid with higher interest and we know of the concerns of people for their jobs and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">We know too of the pressures on people as a result of rising prices, of people going shopping and finding the price of basic necessities like bread and milk are constantly going up.  It means finding that where you once paid €40 to €50 to fill the tank in your car, you are now paying €60 to €70.  Last week, RTE carried pictures of a scene from Galway which was once familiar, but which I had hoped we would never see again.  These were pictures of queues outside the social welfare office — dole queues.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">That is the new reality of the economy that cannot be ignored.  The changes in the public finances have significant implications for public services.  We already have a health service that is not working and we now know that Departments are already preparing the cuts in services which will be implemented or are intended to be implemented as a result of the change in the public finances.  The Taoiseach today referred to them as "temporary adjustments".  We are talking about cutbacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">When this House goes into recess, the Government's intention is that Ministers and Departments will be deciding what public services will be cut.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_694">We have already seen some of these cuts taking place.  I refer to the decision not to proceed with and the delay in proceeding with services for the homeless.  We have seen people with disabilities unable to get the carers they were promised 12 months ago.  We are already seeing that those who are least able to bear the pain and those who should be least asked to bear the pain are the first to meet the knife of cuts that are already under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The Government's intention is to suspend the Dáil, stop public sessions of the Dáil and go into private conclave in the Cabinet rooms and Departments and to proceed with these cutbacks.  The Government has no right to do this.  This is public business and the situation of our economy and our public services belongs to the people as a whole and the Government should be addressing these issues on the floor of this House, putting the books on the table, putting the case on the table, setting out the options being considered so that we, the representatives of the people, can address them.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">On top of these difficulties we now have the political difficulty which the country as a whole and the Government in particular must address following last week's rejection of the Lisbon treaty.  It is a huge diplomatic challenge.  While I acknowledge the concession made today which allows us a debate tomorrow on this issue, this is an area that requires reflection by this House and requires some time and thought to consider the many issues and responses which arose in the course of the referendum campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">This House needs to continue in session until late July and return in early September to resume addressing these matters.  It is outrageous the Government, which has to date provided so little leadership for this country on a whole range of issues, is proposing to stand down the national Parliament for what is in effect three months, to suspend normal political activity and effectively to suspend public parliamentary debate on its own stewardship and on the problems facing the country.  This should not be acceptable and is the reason the Labour Party — rather than dealing with this matter on the day the Government proposes the adjournment — has put down this motion so we can make a reasoned and I hope convincing case for the Dáil to continue in session for a longer period this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_698">I thank the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, for putting forward this resolution, the purpose of which is to try to restore some sense of moral authority, not simply to the Government but also to the Dáil.  In the good years of the Celtic tiger, this Government and its current Government partners have consistently ripped away Dáil debate and accountability.  This is one of the few times that our economy is being debated in the House because the Government has become adept at debating the economy and giving the picture elsewhere.  When Deputy Brian Cowen was Minister for Finance, he brought that particular art to its zenith.  He was very rarely here to discuss issues.  When he replied to parliamentary questions, he read pages of replies in order to leave as little time as possible for any honest debate or discussion.  Part of what happened in the Lisbon treaty referendum last week is the whirlwind which the Government sowed by refusing to show moral authority.  I refer to the cutbacks faced by many ordinary families, whether they are trying to decide how to meet the extra cost of fuel, whether diesel or petrol, or the extra costs in a myriad of other areas, particularly food and the supermarket shopping.  There are not many members of the Government who push trolleys around supermarkets and there were not many members of the Government who stood outside supermarkets during the Lisbon campaign to talk to people coming out with their trolleys from the supermarket because if they did, they would know that ordinary families are finding it tougher to make critical decisions for themselves and their children when it comes to allocating resources and dealing with the downturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Mr. Owen O'Callaghan, that redoubtable Cork entrepreneur and builder and perhaps potentially one day, star of the tribunals, was quoted as saying in a headline interview in <i>The</i>
                        <i>Sunday Tribune </i>three weeks ago that “There will be blood”.  I do not know if the Minister of State with responsibility for the Lisbon treaty realised that the blood which would be all over the place would be that of the Government’s and that the people would give it a very rude awakening.  In many ways the impression the Government has given in the past few days reminds me of the Bush Administration and its officials in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, an attitude of “We know what is best, we know how to deal with it”, when in fact, we have not heard any concrete and serious attempt to address the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I refer to Mr. Alan McQuaid of Bloxham Stockbrokers, one of the most respected commentators on the Irish economy.  He stated in a report, "that based on our figures, we are in a stagflation environment and a recession is looming."  The phrase, "stagflation", takes us back to the awful period of the 1970s, brought on in part by the oil crisis and the huge rise in the price of oil.  It means we have stagnant growth in jobs and output.  Not only are we experiencing stagnant growth in jobs and output we are also experiencing a severe loss of jobs across the board.  Stagflation means stagnation plus inflation and our inflation rate is continuing to hover all the time just below 5%.  The European Central Bank does not sound as though it will bring home owners any comfort anytime soon.  Given its concerns about inflation, the ECB is indicating strongly it may well continue to raise interest rates over the next six to 18 months.  The pressures on the Irish economy, and all the factors the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, indicated could go wrong in his last budget, all appear to have gone wrong together.  In many ways we are facing all those negatives in a difficult situation.  I have no doubt Ministers are being confronted daily by the Department of Finance in what appears to be a consistent demand to cut current spending by approximately 8% or back to 2006 levels.  The issue is who will bear the brunt of the cuts.  As far as the Labour Party is concerned, the brunt of the coming cutbacks, which the Government is planning but will not discuss with anyone, will be borne by the weakest people in society.  In addition to being unfair it also makes for really bad economics.  There are people in this society who have done extraordinarily well from the boom years, but we do not need to punish vulnerable people by making their difficulties even worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">I worry about the participation of the Greens in this Government because they do not seem to have any economic dialogue with Fianna Fáil as the leading partners.  Our health service appears to be drifting hopelessly without leadership.  Almost daily, the Opposition raises the lack of information in the health service, the crisis in nursing homes and nursing home payments.  The notion the Dáil can toddle off to the seaside with a bucket and spade, taking holidays for two or three months or more, is obscene.  There is important work to be done in trying to sort out where we are.  There are plenty of positive aspects in the economy and our people have a "can do", entrepreneurial spirit.  We have well educated young people and the mechanism to build the knowledge economy.  We can move from this negative period into a period of better growth in two to three years' time, but only if we play our cards right and if the Government does not act punitively towards the poorest people in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">In order to arrive at a consensus about how to do this, the Government must be accountable to the Dáil and be prepared to debate the economy.  The Government has plans concerning the national development programme, which depend largely on public private partnerships.  We heard about grandiose plans for the mega-prison in Thornton Hall, involving the destruction of an existing women's prison and its relocation to the Thornton site, but we do not even have an estimate of what that is likely to cost.  We had clutches of overblown elements in the national development plan but we do not even have a forum in this House to discuss the plan in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">I have great confidence in Irish people's ingenuity and hard work, which they have exhibited in spades for the last 15 years.  People ended up voting "No" to Lisbon because they were uncertain about their future, while the Government seemed to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to them.  To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, it could be said of the Taoiseach that to lose one referendum is unfortunate, but to lose two referenda is a disaster.  Uniquely under his stewardship, the Taoiseach has played a primary role in the loss of two referenda.</p>

          <p eId="para_705">There is one issue the Government has not addressed.  Later this year or sometime next year, we may exceed the Maastricht criteria.  In that case we may need to go to Brussels and discuss with our EU partners whether our national development plan's investment programme allows us to exceed the Maastricht criteria in some way.  Given the way the Government has behaved, it is difficult to say whether we will have friends to count on or whether we will get a rough ride.  The Government has not done a good job over the past month for the people or for the country.  It was too taken up with the succession to Deputy Bertie Ahern and was paralysed as a result.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">I thank the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore, for proposing this motion, which I hope the Government will have the good sense to accept.  We face many challenges and none more essential than in the area of energy.  Oil prices have reached a record $140 a barrel, which represents a 40% increase since Christmas.  Commuters and road hauliers feel they are being mugged on garage forecourts given the costs they are facing.  Petrol has risen nearly 7% in one month alone, while the cost of diesel has jumped by 30% in nine months.  Meanwhile, when these issues are raised by Deputies such as myself, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, throws up his hands saying he can do nothing about prices.  He does say, however, that he is doing something about increasing renewables and reducing our reliance on oil.  Whatever about his first statement, there is a question mark over the second one he keeps making.  In order to ensure we tackle our energy needs and meet our climate change proposals, we need fewer speeches and more science from the Minister.  The Labour Party supports his drive to ensure that renewables play a greater part in energy generation, but that is why we are so disappointed in his dismal failure to introduce the new tariff scheme on offshore wind.  The Minister announced the scheme with great fanfare in January but it has not materialised.  None of the €4 billion that was to be spent by the private sector has materialised, instead of which we get speeches about climate change.  We still have an enormous dependence, almost 90%, on fossil fuels and the record of broken promises on our CO2 emissions is simply getting longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">We are seeking a strategic approach from the Government on energy.  The Labour Party has published legislation for a fuel poverty strategy and has asked the Government to debate the measure in the House.  Today's report from Sustainable Energy Ireland shows fuel poverty is a real and growing phenomenon in our society.  Some 145,000 households are already experiencing fuel poverty.  Electricity and gas bills will rise by up to 20%.  This winter, the elderly in particular will not be able to keep themselves warm.  As we know already, many old people die as a consequence of that lack of protection.  There is a fuel poverty strategy in place in Northern Ireland and Britain, but not here in the Republic.  If we cannot look after the most vulnerable people, then something is not working at the heart of Government.  We need to address that in this House and not allow the Government to go on holidays.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Some people say Green Ministers are more interested in saving the planet than caring about people, but I cannot believe that is true.  There is, however, a blinkered approach by the Government because Ministers are so cocooned they have no understanding of how difficult it is for ordinary people to cope with rising bills.  All the evidence is that that approach will continue unless a new strategic approach is adopted by the Government to tackle fuel poverty and fast track renewables.  In addition, a carbon fund is required possibly using additional VAT funding or the windfall from funding electricity generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The Government has a responsibility to work hard in dealing with the challenges that currently face society.  This cannot be done behind closed doors but must be done in an open and democratic manner.  One of the concerns people had regarding the Lisbon treaty was that it was somehow an erosion of democracy.  Let us see the democracy we hold dear work in this House at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">On behalf of Sinn Féin Deputies, I support the Labour Party motion.  Sinn Féin has long argued that comprehensive reform of the Dáil and Seanad is required, including among many other issues, shorter summer recesses.  Each year the Government goes through the farce of sitting in the first week of July and returning in the last week of September in order that it cannot be said the Dáil did not meet for three months, even though it will be adjourned for all but two of the 12 weeks in question.  This practice fools no one, nor will anyone be fooled by the proposal in the form of the amendment to the motion to debate the national development plan in a bogus Dáil week with no questions to the Taoiseach or Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The issues facing the country are extremely serious and need to be addressed effectively by the Government and Oireachtas.  There has been an alarming rise in the number of people unemployed in the Twenty-six Counties.  From January to May 2008, the number of unemployed people claiming benefit rose by almost 48,000, an increase of 31% and the biggest rise since records began in 1967.  Unemployment stands at more than 200,000 for the first time in nearly a decade.  This is 5.4% in the Twenty-six Counties and while the actual number unemployed is reaching the level of the 1980s, the working population is much greater so the percentage rate is lower.  Nonetheless, this is a very serious situation and an indicator of fundamental flaws in the economy for which successive Governments since the mid-1990s bear full responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Some of those who advocated a "Yes" vote on the Lisbon treaty threatened voters with the prospect of widespread job losses.  This threat was deeply insulting to those who lost their jobs over the past 12 months while the Government failed to take any action whatever to protect vulnerable workers and create alternative employment.  If jobs continue to be lost in the months ahead, it will have nothing to do with how we voted in the referendum but will be the result of Government inaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">A great proportion of the numbers joining the dole queue have come from the construction industry in which a slowdown was inevitable.  Simply put, only so many houses can be built.  However, the decline in construction has been made far worse by the reckless policies pursued by Fianna Fáil-led Governments which have placed far too much reliance on construction, in particular the private speculative housing market, for economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">This was bad policy on two counts.  First, it failed to meet housing needs equitably with tens of thousands of people left on local authority waiting lists for accommodation and low to middle income families unable to afford homes or else saddled with massive mortgages.  Second, it was bad employment policy because it has left masses of young workers unprepared for employment in other sectors.  There is now a large group of people in their late 20s and early 30s who left school a decade ago, went into relatively well paid jobs in construction during the boom years and have not known unemployment since.  They are now experiencing the first shock of joblessness and many are heavily indebted thanks to the policy of easy credit.  The real winners in the boom years were the biggest property speculators and developers and the rapacious financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">This requires a major change in Government policy.  Workers must be retrained and local authorities financed to construct social and affordable housing, including the completion of the long promised housing redevelopments in Dublin city which have been scuppered by the pull-out of McNamara Construction from the ill advised public private partnership projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The new Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, recently announced the ending of the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway Races where the party's developer friends were wined and dined for the past decade.  The interests of this group still dictate Government policy and the jobless figures show the long-term consequences of handing the economy over to them.  It must be reclaimed.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">We must also reclaim our public services from the policy of privatisation and cutbacks.  New figures show the failure of the Government and HSE, one year on from the publication of the emergency department task force report, to reduce the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency departments in some of the largest hospitals in the State.  Statistics provided to the <i>Irish Medical News </i>by the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine show numbers of patients on trolleys in accident and emergency departments are up to three times higher than this time last year.  The task force was set up after the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated the position in accident and emergency departments was a national emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">We now find that five major hospitals — Beaumont Hospital, Sligo General Hospital, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe and University College Hospital, Galway — are showing significant increases in numbers on trolleys in April 2008 as compared to the same month last year.  Numbers trebled in Sligo and more than doubled in Beaumont and Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Today we learn that another report to the board of the HSE shows that more than 40% of all patients in hospital accident and emergency departments who required admission had to wait longer than 12 hours, the official maximum period of waiting for a bed as set by the HSE and Minister for Health and Children.  In the first four months of 2007, 4,799 patients had to wait for more than 12 hours in accident and emergency before admission to a hospital bed.  In the same period this year, the figure rose to 6,159.  Even more alarmingly, in 2007, 786 patients had to wait more than 24 hours but in 2008 the number has increased to 1,185.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">These figures expose again the glaring need to provide additional hospital beds to address this crisis.  We also need to see the delivery of the promised network of primary care centres and step-down facilities to free up hospital beds at both ends of the hospital system.  The Government wants to centralise virtually all hospital services to the very hospitals which are currently under most pressure.  Such a disastrous policy must be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">When the HSE began to impose cuts last September, including its recruitment freeze, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and HSE chief, Professor Brendan Drumm, claimed the cuts would not affect patient care.  They were proven wrong almost immediately and over the past eight months the effect of the cuts has been felt across the health services.  Such is the concern at the extent of the cuts that the 28,000 members of IMPACT in the health services are on a work to rule and last week held protests at hospitals throughout the State.  I commend the workers in IMPACT and other health service unions for their actions on behalf of patients and staff in our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Essential improvements in services such as primary care, mental health services, care for older people and disability services are not taking place because of the HSE recruitment freeze.  I highlighted in questions to the Minister recently just one area of great need which is not being properly met, namely, the shortage of speech and language therapists.  While additional training places have been created, not enough posts have been put in place to meet the needs of children who require early intervention.  We face the prospect of trained therapists having to emigrate to find work while children are denied the therapy they so desperately need.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The Government and HSE, even in their own book-keeping terms, are operating a false economy.  The failure to develop primary care as promised leads to more dependence on our hard pressed hospital accident and emergency departments.  The axing of the hospital in the home scheme leads to patients being admitted as inpatients, thus lengthening the waiting lists for beds.  Inadequate services for older people and people with disabilities in their own homes leads to more people than necessary being admitted to residential care at much greater cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">Increased fuel and energy prices are having profound and damaging knock-on effects throughout the economy and add up to 10% to many people's weekly income.  The fact the Government did not raise the fuel allowance in the previous budget means those failing to meet the price of fuel before the latest increases are now suffering hugely.  What are the prospects for them as the year proceeds into the autumn and winter?</p>
          <p eId="para_725">I support the call of my colleague, Deputy Arthur Morgan, for the Government to immediately help those living with fuel poverty by increasing the fuel allowance accordingly.  There must be action to address the high cost of diesel and its devastating effect, especially on small businesses and farming and fishing communities.  All we have had so far is a shrug of the shoulders from Ministers, which is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">I say to the Government that cuts will be resisted.  The Government did not receive a mandate in the 2007 general election to impose cuts in public services.  On the contrary, it promised greatly enhanced services across the board.  During the referendum it treated the people with arrogance.  Frankly, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, was a great participant in that exercise.  The Government asked the people to trust it and the people showed that the Government betrayed that trust, as is clearly evidenced by their clear rejection of the Government's leadership.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_745">We have transformed our economy into one where more than 2 million people are in employment.  However, as Deputies will be aware, the economy is entering a more challenging period.  That is true not just of this economy but of economies around the world.  Domestically, the pace of transition for new house building to more sustainable levels of output is having a significant dampening effect.  Global economic developments are compounding the current situation.  The credit crunch has become a global reality.  A continuation of international financial market difficulties, rising food and commodity prices, adverse exchange rate movements and a general weakening of the economic outlook in several of our major trading partners will cause problems in the months and perhaps the period ahead.  The impact of this combination of domestic and external shocks is reflected in the recent disappointing economic news.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that, as if all this were not enough, we now must deal with the uncertainties that have arisen as a result of last week's decision in the referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Although we are facing into a number of short-term difficulties, the economic prospects beyond these still remain favourable for this country.  While there are real risks, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the underlying health of the Irish economy is good and the economy has responded quickly and effectively to difficulties in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">In the past ten years, the rate of economic growth in Ireland has averaged 7% per annum and that is why I do not recognise where the last contribution was coming from.  This very strong rate of expansion has facilitated a convergence in Irish <i>per capita</i> incomes to and beyond those enjoyed in other advanced economies.  Among the economic strengths that underpin our economic resilience are that the public finances are sound, with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area.  This is something that we must continue to protect.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past.  The soundness of our public finances will allow for the continuing maintenance of a framework of macro-economic and budgetary stability which will be crucial in the years ahead.  It is important that we defend this position in the months ahead and that we focus particularly on sound public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">In addition, our markets are flexible, allowing us to respond quickly to difficulties, we have a dynamic and well educated labour force, we have a pro-enterprise oriented society and the taxes for workers and businesses are low.  We must ensure that we keep our taxes that way.  Not many countries in the world are facing the present economic difficulties from such a position.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">On a further positive note, through the progressive delivery of the productive investment priorities in the national development programme, the Government is helping position the Irish economy to take advantage of a future upswing in the global economy, improve our competitiveness and provide a better quality of life for everybody in the country.  The investment in economic infrastructure and human capital will help boost the productive capacity in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">This perspective on the positive medium-term outlook for the Irish economy has been shared recently by the Economic and Social Research Institute in its Medium Term Review 2008-2015.  Due to our sound economic management and the underlying health of the economy, the institute agrees that the Irish economy is flexible and resilient and has the ability to absorb a downturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">On the issue of employment, a number of Deputies referred specifically to the downturn in recent times.  It is worth reminding ourselves that over the past decade employment has continued to grow dramatically.  It has risen to the point where there are 2.1 million at work at present.  When we joined the European Union, in spite of the advices from the Sinn Féin Party, fewer than 1 million people were at work.  This improvement has resulted in halving the unemployment rate from 10% over the most recent period.  We all are aware of the impact that unemployment has on those directly affected as well as on their families and on the wider communities in which they live.  The recent increases in unemployment are deeply regrettable.  However, despite the recent upturn in unemployment, Ireland still has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the euro area.  It is generally accepted that the strong rate of employment growth experienced in recent years could not continue and the economy is entering a period of adjustment.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">While the slowdown in house building has resulted in increased unemployment in this area, overall employment is forecast to continue to grow.  The big challenge for us in the period immediately ahead will be to deal in particular with people who need to upskill.  FÁS is providing a range of job-related services, supports and programmes to assist people to remain in the labour force.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">On recent developments, we are all aware that Ireland is a small open economy.  It is simply a reality that we are a price-taker, not a price-fixer, and the prices we must take will obviously have inflationary impacts.  In the short to medium term, what the Government can do includes implementing responsible fiscal policies and promoting competition and increased price transparency through the work of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, which can address some of the negative impacts of the prices we must take.  Over the longer term, the considerable investment in public infrastructure undertaken by the Government will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services on a more economic basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">From a competitiveness perspective, I stress the importance of ensuring that the externally-driven price increases that we are currently experiencing are not exacerbated by internally-generated second-round effects.  Deputy Burton made the point about stagflation, and she will recall that this was precisely the formula that caused stagflation in the 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Deputy McManus made a fair point about fuel prices.  The reality is we are experiencing an international phenomenon that will have an impact.  However, it is not truthful to suggest, as was suggested, that the Government has been unconscious of this.  Measures are in place to help those in greatest need under the national fuel scheme.  The household benefits package includes a free electricity or gas allowance.  The gas allowance was extended in the 2008 budget.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides additional mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">It is fair to say we are going through a period of unprecedented economic turmoil.  The most important response we can have to this is to ensure we keep our heads in terms of economic policies, that we keep a particular focus on strong public finances and that we do not fall back into the ways of the past and borrow to try to deal forward.  It is critically important, therefore, that in more challenging times we do not take the wrong steps, steps so frequently advocated by Sinn Féin, in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Going back to the point about the referendum last week, I agree this adds an additional challenge but we have shown in the past that we are capable as a nation, a people and as a Government of dealing with challenges.  We look forward to doing that in the months ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">The issues outlined in the motion are important and they require a strong hand on the tiller in a time of crisis.  I am bewildered that Deputy Ó Caoláin believes the result of the Lisbon referendum has absolutely no bearing on a clear direction for the State of Ireland ship.  If one reads any of the international press over the past few days, one will see that the indecision arising from the Irish result feeds into a significant difficulty for Ireland in Europe and on the world stage.  What is needed is clear direction, particularly in times of economic difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The Opposition motion suggests nothing has changed and that there has been no response to some of the issues.  From our perspective and that of my colleagues who sit at the Cabinet table, changes have been made for the better which will result in the economy and the people being able to face difficult economic times with more confidence.  We have racked up the building regulations by 40% over the past year.  That is a significant step towards dealing with increasing fuel prices.  We have made changes to the green homes scheme which will lead to a significant improvement in the quality of the building stock not only for the well-off, but for those on lower incomes.  The increased funding for the warmer homes scheme and the new pilot schemes will allow people to see very clearly the energy saving after the changes have been made.  I am mindful of the memory of throwing money at the problem when 20 or 30 years ago every second timber sash window in the country was taken out and replaced with PVC windows.  That was not money well spent.  One must be very careful and targeted with the funding spent in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The new vehicle registration scheme will kick in this month.  That will lead to consumers being much more conscious of the economy and the carbon emissions of the vehicles they drive.  That will change consumer behaviour and the behaviour of the very large international companies selling goods in Ireland.  I note the motion rails against the high prices being charged by British multiples.  Perhaps we should look at changes in labelling to better reflect the value of what is on offer in the marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The Labour Party also talked about price tariffs for wind energy from offshore wind.  It is very important we get the balance right there because if we reward those providing offshore wind at an unreasonably high tariff, those costs will be passed on directly to the consumer.  It is crucial we get the balance right rather than jump into this without carefully looking at the costs and benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The Government's response to the Labour Party motion has been carefully considered.  It is much more important to propose rather than oppose and wring one's hands at the state of the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_775">I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to a very important debate and like my Green Party colleague, Deputy Ciarán Cuffe, I commend the Labour Party in that regard.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, for sharing his time and commend the Government amendment.  It is important we welcome the Government's commitment to increase the number of Dáil sittings in July, which the public will want.  Deputy David Stanton might have to cancel his holidays but I have not had to do so.  I will be happy to be here, and it is important we are here.  For a few weeks after the Dáil rises, we will all be at committee meetings dealing with the business of the country and of our communities, which is important.  Let us not be too cynical.  The decision will be welcomed and it will be interesting to see how the media handles it tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">Other colleagues spoke about the events of the past week.  I am as disappointed as anybody.  There was a very strong "No" vote in Dublin South-West, as there has tended to be in referenda over the years.  Our job is to try to get our message across, which I have been doing over the past few days.  As I went about Dublin South-West, particularly the Tallaght region, over the past few days, people were not talking to me about the aftermath of Lisbon as much as the issues which concern them, such as the economy, jobs, infrastructure and facilities.  I wish the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, well because he will have a difficult few months and will have to wrestle with the challenges of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Other colleagues will make important points in this debate but I always go back to my political roots and am always reminded of the work of my predecessor, Chris Flood.  Regardless of the state of the economy, particularly in times which may be more challenging than usual, we must remember our commitment to social inclusion policies.  I live in a constituency in which I have always sung that particular hymn.  In the current political and economic climate, it is important we remember that.  I hope the Fianna Fáil-led Administration will continue to do what the party has always done, namely, to look after the vulnerable and those who are under much pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">My fellow Dub, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, often used to say in regard to social inclusion that at a time when all boats are rising, we must remember the little boats.  If all boats are being somewhat battered, although I am quite confident about the Government's ability to deal with that, we must also remember the little boats.  I will say to the Minister for Finance and his colleagues, in particular, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, that, as we move towards budget time, we must remember the need to continue to finance education, health and social welfare in a special way and that we must look after the vulnerable and those who will need our help even more.  I am glad to welcome the commitment in the Government amendment to protect the poor and vulnerable in our society as evidenced by the significant resources always allocated to the areas I mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I refer to disability because it is important we recognise the need to look after the vulnerable in our society, which we continue to do.  I often examine the programme for Government to ensure we are going in the right direction.  I read today that on disability matters the Government is determined, according to the programme, to continue to prioritise the interests of people with disabilities over the next five years through a series of significant measures.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the strategy is driven and managed from a whole of Government perspective and it will be overseen and supported by the Department of the Taoiseach.  I expect the Government will honour these commitments.  I know the disability community is awaiting a decision by the Department of Health and Children on the release of €50 million which was to be made available this year and I hope the Minister for Health and Children will examine this.  Even at a time when the economy is being challenged, let us look after those we should be looking after.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan</from>
          <p eId="para_780">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the motion.  In recent years we have considered several motions addressing the economy.  As we face into the second half of 2008 there is a significant difficulty facing the country as the external economic environment is very difficult and I know the Government and the Department of Finance are seriously examining this difficulty.  The challenge we face is to ensure we protect our small, open economy from the external difficulties of international financial markets, oil and the credit crunch.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The economy has done very well over the past ten to 12 years and built on the educational success of previous generations.  We have seen significant growth in opportunities for our young people.  The challenge facing the Government, for which it and the new Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, are well equipped, is to ensure it does not allow itself simply to throw money at the problem.  We must ensure that money is targeted.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">I am glad the Government motion seeks to ensure there is a commitment to the poor and vulnerable in society and that there are sufficient resources allocated in the areas of health, education and social welfare.  The previous speaker mentioned social inclusion.  Many of the projects involving partnerships for social development throughout the country in both urban and rural areas have demonstrated a great definition of social inclusion.  Many people who were outside the workforce, or had no way of getting into the workforce through the various social inclusion policy measures implemented by this and previous administrations, have been brought back into it and have got a great buzz and sense of achievement.  It is important that we continue with these measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">It is most important as we face into uncharted waters and difficult times that the fundamentals of the economy are far stronger than they have ever been in our history.  It is important that the bedrock of our economy is maintained.  We have a well educated workforce which is one of our strongest assets and has helped to build our economy.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the opportunities for people of every age in our country in recent years are maintained.  However, the Government and the Oireachtas will have to take difficult decisions in certain areas.  They will make sure the decisions are effective and will ensure the fundamentals of our economy remain strong so that we can escape these difficult times and the difficult economic outlook we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">In a positive report recently the Economic and Social Research Institute underlined in its medium term review that the economy is healthy and strong.  The institute agrees that the Irish economy is flexible and resilient with an ability to absorb the downturn.  It is important that we understand this and ensure the economy continues to be strong, open and flexible.  At the same time we should be mindful of the issues of social inclusion and the weaker in society.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak and I commend the Government's motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_325">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_785">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak.  It was with disappointment that I heard the opening speeches of the Labour Party which continued its old mantra of attacking the Fianna Fáil Government and trying to make the point that Fianna Fáil did not look after the less well off in our society.  However, the evidence is that the last Labour Minister with responsibility in that area gave an increase to social welfare recipients of 79 cent.  The records will show that, even in the toughest of times, Fianna Fáil led Governments gave social welfare increases greater than the rate of inflation.  We will continue to do this as it has been one of the bedrocks of our party.  Over the past ten to 15 years there has been growth in our economy greater than that of any other country in the European Union, even more than 7%.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Employment has risen by 64% since 1995 and more than 820,000 people have come into the employment market.  There are now over 2 million people working in the economy, a factor we must not forget.  The rate of unemployment has come down from 12% in 1995 to 5.4% last month.  However, there is a change in the economy.  The house building industry has contracted, with serious effects on the tax take and levels of employment, but we must not see this as a doom and gloom situation.  The economic forecasts from general economic commentators state that there will be growth of up to 2% this year in the economy, which will still represent one of the highest growth rates in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">It is untrue to say that the Government did not warn about what was coming down the tracks.  In the last budget it was made clear by the Department of Finance that there were going to be restrictions in the economy and weaker economic times approaching.  It pointed out clearly that international financial market difficulties had intensified; the exchange rate had appreciated significantly, which undermined our competitiveness; oil prices had risen to an all-time high and continue to rise; and that global inflation had picked up, reducing the scope for many central banks to stimulate demand through lowering nominal interest rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">We must regain competitiveness, which is crucial to the future of the economy.  We are an export based economy, exporting between 85% and 90% of GDP and we must continue in that vein.  The fundamentals of our economy, as has been pointed out by many speakers, are strong.  We have a dynamic and well educated labour force.  Our markets are flexible, allowing us to respond efficiently to adverse developments, and we have a pro-business, outward looking society.  Our public finances are sound with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area.  The tax burden on both labour and capital is low and participation in the EMU provides insulation against currency speculation.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">When I worked in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I was involved in drawing up innovation policy.  That policy statement was put before the Government several months ago.  It shows that the significant and sustained investment in human capital, physical infrastructure and commercialisation of research is beginning to bear fruit.  We must continue to invest in that area to ensure our educational institutions produce the numbers of educated young people needed to develop our economy and our industry.  Investment in education at all levels must not be curtailed because it is the lifeblood of the future of our economy.  It is essential if the economy is to grow in the years ahead.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_792">I would like to speak in favour of the Labour Party motion, which raises three essential issues — the relevance of this Parliament; public trust in politics and politicians, given the way we behave; and the key social and economic challenges we face.  While it may not be wise to include all three issues in one motion, that has been done and we have to debate them.  I propose to address them separately.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The first issue is the relevance of this House as a functioning Parliament.  Deputy Timmins and I called for the adjournment of the proceedings of the House under Standing Order 32 to discuss the decision of the people, by referendum, not to ratify the Lisbon treaty.  While I respect the decision made by the Ceann Comhairle not to accede to our request, I do not agree with it.  I feel that the Members of the House should have been given an opportunity to discuss this important matter, which is not only one of the major news items of the day in Ireland, but is also on the front pages and editorial columns of every newspaper in Europe.  We were told today in this House that it is not a matter of national importance.  Instead, we are considering legislation we have been discussing for weeks, as well as this motion, which could have been considered any week, quite frankly.  That this Parliament is becoming so irrelevant to politics and the real world around us is an indictment of us.  It damages this House and this democracy much more than we realise.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The House will debate the Lisbon treaty tomorrow, in the form of statements.  We all know that will involve politicians coming to the Chamber, speaking to themselves, getting recorded in the Official Report and perhaps being quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  In a real parliament, we would have an opportunity to make statements if we really wanted but, more importantly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs would take questions and engage in a proper discussion of what is important.  The Minister for Health and Children is the only Minister in the Government who has the courage and the balls, quite frankly, to do that.  Since I was elected to this House, she has come to the Chamber on two occasions to answer hard questions on issues such as cancer services.  The other Ministers between them do not have the courage of that one woman.  No other Minister is prepared to make himself or herself accountable before the House.  For example, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, absolutely refused to come to the House to explain the driving licence fiasco.  It is a real shame.  I am being non-partisan by pointing out that at least one member of the Cabinet believes in Parliament and has the courage to be accountable to it.  No other Minister is prepared to do that.  Our Parliament is irrelevant because it does not ensure that Ministers are accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008 and the motion on the proposed prison at Thornton Hall are being guillotined in the House today.  The discussion on them is being limited.  Opposition parties are given just three hours of Private Members' time each week in which to set the agenda.  I was about to say that smaller parties like the Labour Party and Sinn Féin should be given more time, but perhaps they do not deserve it because there is no Labour Party Deputy present for this part of the debate on a Labour Party motion.  Such parties get an opportunity to raise and discuss issues once every six weeks.  There is plenty of scope for longer sittings, which would give the Opposition more time to raise important issues.  The leader of the Labour Party mentioned earlier that the House of Commons meets 133 days a year and the US Senate meets over 150 days a year, but this House meets less than 100 days a year.  While Italy is not the hardest working country in Europe when it comes to other sectors of the economy, its parliament is different, given the Italian Chamber of Deputies meets 160 days a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">During the debate on the Lisbon treaty referendum, many people suggested that the EU is not democratic and that more democracy is needed at EU level.  The European Union is a damn sight more democratic than Ireland.  The European Parliament actually has power.  It defeats the European Commission on certain issues, changes legislation, sits for longer periods of time, does not have a party whip, is not controlled by the Government and is not a rubber stamp for the Commission.  The European Union is much more democratic than Ireland.  The European Parliament is a lot more powerful in the EU system than the Oireachtas is in the Irish system.  The Government controls and prorogues our Parliament because it does not want it to function.  Essentially, it wants a one-party State and a rubber-stamp Parliament.  Such a system is probably more suited to an African country then a European one, but it is essentially what we have.  It is like the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union.  We have a show parliament that does not really function.  As someone who came from county council level, where real decisions were made and one could win a vote by the strength of one's argument, it is frustrating for me to find that does not happen in the Dáil.  The proposal to go on holidays for three months exposes to the world the irrelevance of this House.  It underlines the fact that the Government does not want it to be relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">I support the Labour Party's proposed sitting hours.  We do not need to sit until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. each night.  We could finish early.  Most people finish work at a reasonable time like 6 p.m.  We could do that.  It is very difficult for women with families to participate in politics because they are unfairly expected to be here until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. — or 10 p.m., as it is tonight.  Such sitting hours remain from the old days of gentlemen politicians or barristers who spent the day in the Law Library before coming here to talk about the grave issues of the day.  Rather than having 12-hour and 15-hour sessions, why not have an eight-hour or nine-hour day, like most people?  Such shorter sitting days should be spread more evenly throughout the year.  We should have proper committee weeks in which committees sit but the House does not meet in plenary session.  Members are aware of the rushed 90-minute committee meetings we have at present.  If somebody calls a vote in the Dáil, committee meetings have to be suspended and everybody has to run to the Chamber to vote.  That is no way to do business.  We could have the same number of sitting weeks, as well as distinct committee weeks.  We could also have party weeks.  If Members do not want to be here for party political weeks, they will not have to be.  Such weeks should be provided for.  Political parties have very little time to meet and discuss strategies and policies.  Today's meeting of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party took place at 5.30 p.m., at the same time as a debate in this Chamber.  The meeting had to break up when a vote was called here.  We do not get any credit for the crazy workaholic 13-hour days we work.  The work of Parliament should be done in eight-hour days which are spread over a longer period of time.  That is what is done in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Public trust in politics and politicians is at an all-time low.  As someone who works as a doctor in my other life, I really see the difference.  I am the same person when I am a doctor as I am when I am a politician.  When I am a doctor, I am treated with undeserved respect and confidence, for some reason I do not fully understand, and I am paid a hell of a lot more.  When I am a politician, I am treated like a lazy pariah and liar who does no work.  I am paid much less as a politician than I am as a doctor.  I am begrudged very penny I earn as a politician by people, including journalists, who earn much more than me.  That is a real problem for us.  The people's low opinion of politicians is one of the reasons the Lisbon treaty was defeated.  While that opinion is mostly undeserved, it is partly deserved as a consequence of the way this Parliament acts.  I refer to the long holidays we take, the unaccountable way in which we are paid our expenses and the fact Ministers, if not ordinary Deputies, are prepared to award themselves massive pay increases at a time when most people are facing tighter budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">We should not forget the serious impact of the tribunals.  I do not think it is just a question of the cost of tribunals, although that is an issue.  People would be prepared to bear the cost if they believed there were consequences resulting from the tribunals.  There are no consequences, however.  A former Taoiseach has gone to the tribunal and essentially given the John Gilligan defence — that he won the money on the horses.  This is a defence for drug dealers and pimps and not the kind of thing that should be tolerated from a former Taoiseach and Member of this House.  We do nothing, we wash our hands and say it is a matter for the tribunal.  There is no system of accountability or ethics, and we ask ourselves why people have such a low opinion of politicians.  People have such a low opinion of politicians because we will not root out the rotten apples in our own barrel, and we allow them to contaminate our entire system.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">I welcome this motion.  I did not get a chance to talk about some of the key social and economic challenges we face.  Deputy Stanton will do that.  It is important that we get real.  Politics in this country is falling apart.  We must show the people we work hard and that our work is relevant.  We must begin to restore trust in politics and this is one way of doing it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_801">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this motion.  Last week should have been a wake-up call for politics in Ireland.  There was a great deal of talk during that week about accountability, democracy and so on.  That has to start here in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">As I look around, there are four Members in the Chamber.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, was not in the House when this debate commenced.  His colleague, Deputy Roche, came into the House and told us we were facing "unprecedented economic turmoil", then left the Chamber.  Deputy Cuffe arrived into the Chamber, castigated all of us, particularly the Labour Party, for tabling this terrible motion, and then scurried out.  Debate means coming into this House and listening to what people have to say, then refuting, agreeing or disagreeing with it.  To do otherwise is not to debate an issue.  We might as well swap e-mails.  This is happening over and over again in regard to most of the work done in this House.  Very few Members come to the Chamber to listen to what is said.  There is no debate on issues. We could shut the House down and simply correspond by e-mail.  Not one of our media friends is present in the public gallery for this debate.  I will probably be lambasted in the press next week for attacking a sacred cow.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The Government has stated the Dáil will sit an extra week, but that will not be the case because we have already lost a week as a result of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, and rightly so.  It is proposed that during this extra week the House will debate the national development plan, but there will be no debate.  People will simply come in, say what they have to say and scurry out again.  There will be no Question Time and no Order of Business, and that is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Muiris MacCarthaigh in his book <i>Accountability in Irish Parliamentary Politics</i> stated that Dáil Éireann cannot oversee Government when it is not in session.  That the Cabinet continues to meet during periods of recess is identified as a particular problem.  In Westminster the Cabinet does not meet when the Houses are in recess.  How can we as a Parliament oversee Government work when we are not sitting?  The Government carries on.  Government is to a greater extent treating this House and Parliament as a rubber stamp, a nuisance and something that has to be got over.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Decision-making patterns that have developed in recent years have effectively by-passed Parliament.  Agreements between the Government and social partners are presented as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  Ratification of the Lisbon treaty would have allowed us to scrutinise EU decisions before they were taken.  That cannot happen now.  The rulings of the courts change the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Deputy Charlie O'Connor told us earlier what the Government will do in respect of disabilities.  What he and Deputies from all sides should be doing is holding the Executive to account in this regard.  What is happening now is that the Executive is controlling the Dáil.  It decides when the Dáil sits, what it discusses and when it discusses it.  The Dáil is simply a convenience for the Executive and that should not be the case.  The Whip system in other parliaments is not as rigid and as such Members can voice their opinions freely.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The people are sick and tired of what is going on here.  As stated earlier, we will go on holidays in a few weeks' time for three months.  That is appalling.  Many Deputies have stated that Members work hard.  What will Deputies do for the three months the House is not sitting?  There will be no parliamentary questions to be prepared and no debates to attend, and we are no longer members of local authorities.  What will Deputies do?  The Dáil should meet up to the end of July and should return in early September as suggested by the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">There is no point in being here unless we reform how this House operates.  Deputy Varadkar spoke about committee meetings and how one often has to leave a meeting to attend a vote in this House.  That must change.  We must give more power to the committees.  We could hold plenary sessions in the morning and then adjourn to attend committees.  Members should attend committees, as should the media who should report on them.  If we do not do that we could see other forces in this country beginning to surface.  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, told us we are heading into unprecedented economic turmoil.  Extreme forces, left and right, could surface and find fertile ground if we fail them.  There is a huge responsibility on us to bring about reform.  Unfortunately, given that the Government controls what happens in this House, only it can engage in real reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">The Ceann Comhairle earlier this year initiated a series of discussions on Dáil reform which are worthwhile and welcome.  Most of those discussions relate to Dáil Standing Orders.  Another issue that needs to be examined is the number of quasi unelected authorised non-governmental organisation quangos established by the Government.  They are unaccountable to anyone, particularly this House.  Members seeking information about such agencies by way of parliamentary question are told the Minister no longer has responsibility for them.  How then is a Member to hold such a body to account?  It cannot be done.  These quangos are financed by taxpayers' money yet we cannot question them except every once in a while when they attend a committee for a cosy chat.  Ministers should be answerable in this House for the work of these quangos established by the Government.  The Government has hived off power to these quangos and has filled their boards with their friends.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said he appointed particular people to boards because they were his pals.  He did so not because they had any particular skill, qualification or experience but because they were his pals.  That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The proceedings of the Dáil will, we are told, be televised in 2012, not that far away.  God help those who are Members then if things have not changed because the public will not put up with what is happening in this House.  As Deputy Varadkar stated, politicians and politics are of low standing in this country.  That should not be the case.  The Government needs to engage constructively and positively with Members on all sides of the House in regard to what we do and how we do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">Deputy Michael Ahern spoke about a 2% growth in the economy.  I am not sure that will be the case.  Deputy Burton, when speaking, reminded me of the perfect storm.  What is facing this Government and the country now is rising unemployment, rising interest rates, rising fuel costs and massive discontent and pressure on our people in terms of rising food prices and so on.  We need to get our act together.  As representatives of the people, we need to debate and discuss these issues in this House.  We cannot do so effectively at present given the constraints on us in terms of the procedures in this House.  Those procedures must change soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">One way of addressing this issue is to establish an independent group to examine within a particular timescale what is going on in this House.  While we can address issues such as how questions are taken and so on, we may need to ask what is the role of the Dáil in the 21st century, what should we be doing and how should we be doing it?  I contend we should include ourselves, academics, the media, public officials and the public in such a debate.  That was done in Canada a number of years ago and it was a great success.</p>

        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_816">I thank both the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It is unusual to have the opportunity to thank both of them simultaneously.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I have already mentioned to the Minister the antipathy to this plan from a very august group, the Central Mental Hospital Roundtable Meeting and the Mental Hospital Carers' Group.  I shall mention later the participants who comprise a formidable range of bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">What is proposed is also against Government policy.  It contradicts the principles and recommendations of A Vision for Change, the Government's agreed policy on future mental health services.  It specifically contradicts the following principles:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_819">Priority should be given to the care of individuals with severe and enduring mental illness in the least restrictive environment possible.  Forensic mental health units need to be clearly identified as being intervention and rehabilitation facilities that operate in particular conditions of security rather than facilities offering mainly containment.  Forensic mental health services should have a strong community focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The proposal as laid down, putting the hospital in an isolated rural place like Thornton Hall, flies in the face of these three principles and conditions.  Furthermore, it is against best international practice.  It is incompatible with best international therapeutic practice in forensic psychiatry and mental health.  It is against international human rights obligations.  It contravenes the principles and spirit of both the international convention on economic, social and cultural rights of the United Nations and that body's principles for the protection of persons with mental illness and for the improvement of mental health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">In addition, there was no consultation with users and their families.  The decision was made without consultation with the key stakeholders, the patients, their families and carers.  I am sure that the Minister saw the programme on RTE, as I did, and heard the points made by the Schizophrenia Society of Ireland and by relatives of patients who are now in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">There is an absence of a cost-benefit analysis, including an evaluation of the loss of social and intellectual capital associated with the move, should it be undertaken.  We ask the Government to review its decision to relocate the Central Mental Hospital and to re-consider other options that may be available to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The document I have was put together by a group of people who list, in addition, others who have publicly commented on the proposed relocation of the Central Mental Hospital.  These include Amnesty International's Irish section, Aware, Bodywhys, the eating disorder association of Ireland, Central Mental Hospital Carers' group, the Disability Federation of Ireland, Donncha Ó Connell, Dean of Law at NUI Galway, Fine Gael, Gheel Autism Services, the Green Party in its election manifesto 2007 — I would like to hear from that party its view on the proposal — Hale Housing Association, the Human Rights Commission, Inclusion Ireland, the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, the Inspector of Mental Health Services, the interim National Service Users Executive, the Irish Advocacy Network, the Irish Association of Social Workers, the Irish Penal Reform Trust, Dr. Harry Kennedy, the clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital, the Labour Party, the Mental Health Commission, Mental Health Ireland,  Senator David Norris, the Psychiatric Nurses Association, the former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, Schizophrenia Ireland, Sinn Féin, Dr. Charles Smith, former director of the mental hospitals, and Teenline Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">This long list of august groups have serious concerns about this issue.  In addition, and not mentioned in that report, are other issues that Fine Gael and I have with this proposal.  Are immigrants now to be put on the same site and also stigmatised?  Will their first experience in the country be a placement on the same site as a criminal institution?</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The Minister may not need planning permission from Fingal County Council for this prison but he will need it for the relocated hospital from Dundrum.  I am happy to say that, to my knowledge, none of the 24 councillors on Fingal County Council will back this move and grant such planning permission.  At least the councillors, which include members of Government parties, can see that this is a retrograde step in terms of care of the mentally ill in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">Much of the key skill set that has evolved over 100 years in Dundrum will be lost.  Many of the people who work there will not wish to work in a rural setting on the far side of Dublin, with the associated travel and expense to them personally.  We will lose key workers if the Minister persists in moving the Central Mental Hospital to this site.  It appears to me that, yet again, the Government is more concerned about saving money and face rather than looking after patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">I know the Minister has a reputation for being a hard man, one who is not afraid to take hard decisions.  I ask him, however, in this instance to make sure that the decision he is about to take is modified so that it does not cause hardship, as it surely will, to those who have mental illness in this country.  I ask him to reconsider the situation, particularly as it refers to the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  I further question the wisdom and financial sense of closing a women's prison, a modern facility built only 15 years ago, which has all the benefits of being the centre of the city, allowing for visiting.  Women very often have children and they need to be accessible to them.  Surely that need is better served by their being in town rather than in a rural setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I ask the Minister, once again, to try to see this matter from a perspective other than a fiscal-property one and to think about the implications for the mentally ill, adolescents and, in particular, women.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_829">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  The committee discussion earlier was grossly inadequate.  The debate is to be guillotined tonight but it is totally unacceptable that the committee debate on this matter was also guillotined.  Some Members of the House, myself included, have specific issues on which we required some clarity.  Sadly, an opportunity to get the information we required was not afforded us at the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I have had the chance since then to look at some of the drawings in respect of proposals that are being put forward at the moment.  I wish to get some clarification on some of these matters — perhaps when the Minister makes his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">I wish to focus specifically on the immigration element of this facility.  The Minister told us at the committee that there is no provision for asylum seekers.  If that is the case I ask the Minister where those asylum seekers, who are currently accommodated within the prison system, are to be housed?  A number of asylum seekers are detained in prison at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The Minister has said that up to 100 places are to be provided for deportees in this new facility.  If they double up, if there is sufficient facility for them to do so, 7,300 bednights a year are available for deportees.  I question the logic of this move.  There is a significant and continuing reduction in the numbers of those coming into this country seeking asylum who might potentially be deported from the country.  The number of asylum applications does not equate with the predicted dramatic increase in the number of detainees awaiting deportation.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">According to the Irish Prison Service's report of 2006, 1,113 individuals were detained in prisons prior to deportation from the State.  The Minister said the facility to be provided in Thornton Hall will cater for men and women.  I understand from my map that the men's complex will be separate to that of the women.  Will there be places in the women's prison designated for female detainees pending deportation?  Alternatively, will they be placed in a cordoned-off section of the designated facility in the men's prison?  Will the Minister clarify this?</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I do not see the logic behind catering for 100 places.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008, which is currently in committee, provides for summary deportation.  If someone poses a potential flight risk, the Garda need only pick him or her up when the plane is waiting at Dublin Airport to transport him or her out of the country.  The number entering the system is far lower than it was and I therefore do not believe there is a strong case for increasing capacity for detainees awaiting deportation.  At present, a number of individuals awaiting deportation are detained in prisons around the country, including those in Limerick and Castlerea.  Does the Government intend to detain all such individuals in Thornton Hall?</p>
          <p eId="para_835">It would be remiss of me not to mention two of my newest constituents, who are detained in Castlerea Prison.  They have not been prepared to give the authorities any idea of their identification or origin.  They are reported as having said they are quite happy to remain in the prison rather than be deported.  If this trend were to continue in Thornton Hall, a substantial number of places in the prison would be taken up by individuals who are not prepared to identify themselves or their origins.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">If 100 places are maintained for detainees awaiting deportation per year, there will be an annual bill of €6 million.  This is a conservative estimate.  There are better ways to spend it than on holding facilities for deportees.  What is the Minister's plan for asylum seekers if they are not to be accommodated in this facility?  I hope he will provide some clarity on this.  In his contribution on Committee Stage, the Minister stated there was no provision for asylum seekers but that there is provision in respect of deportees.  It is fundamental that there be clarity on this specific issue because a significant sum is required to hold people in the facility, even if it is to be on a short-term basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">When I raised this issue during Committee Stage of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 with the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he said it is fair to say the basic cost of securing, maintaining and accommodating a deportee, discounting the cost of rehabilitative training, for example, is similar to that of detaining any other type of prisoner.  Naturally, if one were in prison for a short period, one would not require rehabilitative training.  Will the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, state the number of detainees awaiting deportation who will be housed in the proposed facility annually?  There will definitely be a dramatic increase in the number to be detained therein.  The number involved at present is significantly lower than that for which provision is being made at the proposed facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">During the debate of the joint committee today, I referred to the cost of planting mature trees on part of the boundary of the site at Thornton Hall.  I had the opportunity to look at the relevant drawings in the Oireachtas Library and noted the location of existing houses in the vicinity of the prison.  The Minister intends to plant mature trees to give instant height and foliage to a depth of ten to 20 metres in the vicinity of the houses.  This will affect a significant amount of the perimeter of the prison.  I estimate it will be affect 50%, or approximately a mile.  If this is correct, the scale of planting will be pretty significant.  Will the Minster indicate the cost of doing this?  I presume he knows the cost and I hope he can furnish it to the House this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Why was the Office of Public Works not involved directly in the design of the new prison?  It was involved directly in the design of the last greenfield prison development, that is, Castlerea Prison in County Roscommon.  Surely the office has developed expertise in this regard that could facilitate the design of the proposed prison and the surrounding complex.  Senator O'Toole referred today to the impact on the existing water table and aquifers of constructing a concrete wall whose foundations will be significantly deep in the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">I commend the amendment to the House and hope the Minister will accept it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_841">I am sure the Minister knows that, some 20 years ago, the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System, headed by Dr. T. K. Whitaker, produced the landmark report on the Irish prison system.  When I referred to it earlier today, the Minister uttered a rather belittling reply.  I remind him that Dr. Whitaker, who is alive and well — I am not sure if the Minister knows this — wrote this year the foreword to "The Whitaker Committee Report 20 Years On: Lessons Learned or Lessons Forgotten?"  Dr. Whitaker is the doyen of Irish public servants and is in many ways the father of our economic prosperity and growth.  He is also a man with unbelievable humanity capable of reaching out not only to people who are poor but to those on the wrong side of the law, often as a consequence of their poverty.  He does not regard their poverty as an excuse for their being on the wrong side of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">In his foreword, Dr. Whitaker states: "We recommended a limit on prison places as a spur to the introduction of more relevant and less costly forms of legal redress and punishment."  As the Minister stated recently, there is not a red cent for the hospital in Navan.  He will blow the house on this super-prison proposal for 2,200 inmates.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Dr. T. K. Whitaker stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_844">. . . what I have gained from all this is a greater appreciation of the difficulties of dealing humanely and effectively with those [people who end up in prison].  It is disappointing, in this context, that the Dóchas centre for women prisoners faces closure and removal to a less convenient location.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">That is a senior civil servant who used soft words to make an appeal to his successors in the public service to have some sense.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_847">I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to notify me when five minutes have concluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Dr. T. K. Whitaker goes on to state: "it seems that it is not just the penal system, but the whole social system that needs attention, directed towards minimising the alienation from moral and constructive living of so many who, missing out on good parenting and schooling, fall victim to drug abuse and gravitate to crime as a route to peer acclaim and easy money".  I grew up in a tough working class community in which those who did not make it through the education system often ended up in prison and in jail.  I know many parents, particularly mothers, of people who ended up on the wrong side of the law.  The Minister can say "There but for the grace of God" and in recent years, some of his party got to hang their hats in Mountjoy, albeit for a brief period, because they were on the wrong side of the law in their performance as politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The Minister's arrogance about the destruction of Dóchas and the decision to relocate the Central Mental Hospital from Dundrum to Thornton Hall ill-becomes him.  Speaking down the years, Dr. Whitaker has had a point on which, with some humility, all Members could ponder.  Dóchas is the Irish for hope and the Dóchas women's prison attempts to rehabilitate women.  Obviously the Minister has lost the run of himself in respect of this project and rehabilitation has dropped out of the scheme.  I will repeat to the Minister what I stated previously, that the proposal to use a prison van to carry visitors out to the prison is an exercise in despair.  The families who travel on whatever prison transport the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides, be it a van or a bus, are subject to the most incredible pressure by the peers of serious criminals who are incarcerated.  They are under pressure to smuggle drugs and to do deals.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">In a country of Ireland's size, it makes no sense to have a super prison unless, in the context of the public private partnership arranged by the Minister, who will not provide details on the finances, the Government ultimately has an agenda to privatise the prison.  The Green Party Members, who are absent from the debate tonight, stated in their election manifesto and at numerous public meetings that the prison at Thornton Hall would not go ahead.  The silence and absence of its Members is an eloquence of what their word and bond means.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_851">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an dTeachta Burton as a cuid ama a roinnt.  This process is flawed from start to finish.  Although I will not go over the ground again, the site's procurement was questionable.  Moreover, the proposal before Members is questionable.  The alternatives have not been investigated fully and super prisons do not deliver the result wished for by society.  Anyone who has examined super prisons in other countries will be aware they contribute to gang warfare and the growth of gangs, and that is what this project is.  In addition, it is questionable whether anyone considered an alternative to the public private partnership method of delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">However, I will concentrate on the motion before us, which essentially asks Members to be a planning authority.  Although any planning authority will examine the detail of what is put in front of it, Members do not have specific details in respect of what has been put before them.  At the committee meeting, I asked for certain details but was met with a snigger.  That is not good enough.  I do not seek to establish the type of bolt that is on prison doors or to ascertain the size of the walls, but Members should be entitled to know the cell size, the type of accommodation, how much space is available for rehabilitation or to visiting facilities and the like.  That is not contained in the details provided.  Members do not know how big the women's prison or the remand section will be.  Similarly, they do not know how large the immigration detention centre will be, as the Minister has been trying to slide it in on the sly.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Members do not know how large the supposed new Garda station will be because the Government has not applied for planning permission.  However, people are being told it will be there.  It is not known how frequent the bus service — this magical bus — will be or whether planning permission has been sought for a court.  Members have not been provided with a massive raft of detail that would enable them to make a decision on this project as a planning application.  Any official in An Bord Pleanála would throw out this proposal lock, stock and barrel because of lack of detail.  It is not good enough for the Minister to ask Members to be a planning authority on something as vague as a 7.2 m wall while everything contained therein is none of their business.  The Minister at committee inaccurately told Members that the highest building in this complex would be two storeys.</p>

          <p eId="para_855">Yes, apart from the tower, which, in the nice little diagrams provided for Members, does not appear.  Members do not know the tower's height and it is not included in the illustrations provided by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The information possessed by Members is inaccurate in itself.  The list of questions and details that have been provided by residents in that area show its inaccuracy and the environmental impact assessment that was carried out did not include the entire site and the surrounding areas.  It did not cover two of the prison's four sides or the local drainage scheme.  While the Minister's officials stated there is no flooding in the area, photographs exist to prove otherwise.  The assessment did not cover a local well that provides the water supply for a local equestrian centre because it does not exist, according to the Minister's adviser.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">This entire matter is farcical from start to finish.  It is a living disgrace that the House is being asked to act as a planning authority with insufficient detail for Members to make an opinion as to whether the House can sign up to something and whether value for money can be achieved.  Moreover, alternatives to incarceration or prison policy in itself have not been considered.  Although these constitute broad areas of discussions that have not taken place in the House, a monstrous prison is being planned.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_858">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to address this issue as Thornton Hall is located in my Dublin West constituency.  I wish to express my opposition to this project in its entirety, first on the basis of its cost.  The site cost is €40 million, which is an extraordinary cost for a piece of agricultural land that probably is only worth approximately €6 million, and that is before one includes the cost of providing the road network linking it to the N2 and the considerable cost of servicing the site, which will add to the total cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">I oppose this project on the basis of its location, which is rural and isolated and is entirely inappropriate for a prison of this scale.  I am concerned about the dubious process by which the site was acquired, the lack of democratic input into the decision effectively to railroad Fingal County Council into accepting this and preventing proper planning process from occurring and the somewhat incomplete environmental impact assessment that was performed.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">I join my party colleagues in expressing concern about the possibility that the site may be used in future to house women prisoners, given that an excellent women's prison already exists.  It would be inappropriate and wrong to move it for property benefits rather than anything else.  I am also concerned the Department will seek planning permission to locate the Central Mental Hospital in Thornton Hall.  This would be a retrograde step and would be the opposite of every other country's policy, which is to separate prisons from forensic mental hospitals.  Let us be honest.  The only reason this is being done is because of the property interests of the various Departments concerned, which want to cash in on some valuable land.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">This proposal should not go ahead on the grounds of human rights.  I will be using my influence with members of Fingal County Council to ensure permission is not granted for the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital to this site, to ensure that a specific objective is not added in and that there is no variation.  However, I have no doubt the Government will try to introduce legislation to get around the council and circumvent democracy once again, in order to impose its money making property plan by selling land in Dundrum and putting the Central Mental Hospital in Thornton Hall.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">The current Minister for Finance is a local TD in Dublin West.  I attended several meetings in the run-up to the general election, in which Deputy Brian Lenihan, then the Minister of State with responsibility for children, promised there would be a full review of the decision to locate the prison if the Government was re-elected.  There can be no doubt that the Minister has betrayed and deceived the electorate of Dublin West in this area, as no such review has been carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">We should not forget the Green Party.  This party was the loudest in its opposition to Thornton Hall.  Speaking in this House, Deputy Cuffe stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_864">Ministers and political leaders have a certain attraction to <i>grands projets</i>.  From Charles Haughey to Mitterand in France, the large projects seem to concentrate minds.  Ceaucescu, the late President of Romania, spent his latter years erecting a large palace for himself in the centre of Bucharest.  Closer to home, the Tánaiste, Deputy McDowell, accused the Taoiseach of pursuing of Ceaucescu like project in the vicinity of the M50.  However, I suspect that the Tánaiste’s political legacy may well be a rather large white elephant on a site ten miles from Dublin at Thornton Hall in Fingal.  The people of Romania eventually revolted and threw out Ceaucescu.  I suspect within the next few months, the Irish people may well be revolted enough to remove the Tánaiste, Deputy McDowell, from office.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">They were revolted enough and Deputy McDowell was removed from office, but the Green Party replaced him and it is pursuing exactly the same policy of the man they compared to Ceaucescu. Haughey and Mitterand.  Never has a party sold itself as cheaply as the Green Party.  Never has a party whored itself so cheaply for so little.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">In a press statement, Deputy Trevor Sargent commented:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_867">Having visited Mountjoy and seen the women's prison, I feel it is an absolute vandalism to suggest the demolition of a prison of that standard, which has many of the facilities about which the Minister spoke.  Much can be done to extend Portlaoise Prison and renovate Mountjoy, as well as looking more carefully at new sites, instead of playing poker with taxpayers' money, as the Minister has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">This was the view last year of the party that is now in Government this year.  I want to give the House one more quote from Deputy Cuffe:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_869">How dare the Tánaiste completely circumvent the planning process in order to build these places of detention?  Whether it is dealing with the protected structures at the Mountjoy site or the archaeology at Thornton Hall, I am deeply alarmed that the Tánaiste is simply avoiding the normal planning process in order to deliver projects.  That is not good enough and is a negation of the public right to have an input.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The Green Party and its members can argue legitimately that they could not stop the development at Tara.  They can perhaps argue they could not stop the incinerator at Poolbeg.  They can argue they cannot do anything about Shannon and that it is too late to do something about Rossport.  However, they cannot argue that they cannot stop the development at Thornton Hall.  They can stop it and can prove they are the party they claim to be by voting against this resolution.  However, they will not do that.  While I accept their explanations to some extent on incineration, on Rossport, on Shannon and on Tara, this issue is a pure litmus test.  If the Green Party is still a party of ethics and high standards, its Members in this House must vote against this proposal tonight, or they will be exposed as cynical and desperate for power and prepared to succumb to Fianna Fáil, regardless of the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">It is also important to mention Deputy Finian McGrath, the former Independent representative for Dublin North-Central.  He also spoke previously on this issue and told us he was totally opposed to Thornton Hall, and that it was a waste of public money.</p>

The Green Party and the former Independent Deputies have become more Fianna Fáil than Fianna Fáil itself.  They have cheapened the political process by their cynical stance on this matter.  This is a litmus test for the sincerity and standards of the Green Party, and I certainly hope its Deputies will vote against this motion, or they will forever be condemned for the coalition they formed and will suffer dearly for it in due course.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_874">I was a member of the McBride commission on prisons in the second half of the 1970s, which was a considerable time before the Whitaker report, and whose members included Gemma Hussey and others.  I remember clearly that when we began hearings and published the first interim report, the then Minister for Justice, Gerard Collins, referred to us as a self-appointed commission.  Be that as it may, we published a book about this towards the end of the 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">It was easier at that time to speak about the welfare of prisoners and about conditions than it is now.  It is incredible that the atmosphere has changed so much among the public, where people feel intimidated from speaking about prisoners' rights.  However, we spoke about those rights and our report was followed by the Whitaker report, to which reference has been made, as well as a number of other comments on the prison system, including that of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.  I also began teaching a course in 1969 on the sociology of deviant behaviour and the sociology of law, in which we discussed issues of imprisonment and alternatives to prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">I remember the atmosphere towards the end of the 1970s.  As sociologists, we were interested at one stage in setting up an institute of criminology.  We were told by many of the fine people who worked in the Department of Justice that they could not openly attend our meetings, as they were forbidden to do so.  That was an obstruction to the establishment of a professional body of people who would discuss issues of criminology.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">Above all else, prison is about the absence of discretion from the prisoner's point of view.  There is no discretion over time, over space or over body.  That one principle explains the entire history of prison, right across the European and American systems.  At different times, people have taken strategies in the running of prisons that concentrate on either the body or on the mind, or on different aspects of the removal of discretion.  The running of prisons is something for which I have the greatest respect, as it is a very difficult thing to do.  To do it well is nearly impossible.  Again, research into the North American system over the past three decades is conclusive to the effect that private involvement in the running of prisons is almost disastrous.  There are many reasons for this.  From advanced models in the Scandinavian system, through different European countries and the entire American Continent, accountability in terms of basic rights and standards to the public and the legal system has been best delivered in an entirely public system.  The private system works in a way that is seriously defective.  For example, the bus that is described as moving people to a new prison is regarded as a degrading shuttle in the American system.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Other issues arise regarding principles of law, namely, the right of people to visit prisoners without being stigmatised.  The entire system in private operation in the United States is about stigma that is not confined to the person who has been convicted.  Looking back to the time of the McBride report and on to the Whitaker report, I want to say something about the incredible cult and culture of secrecy that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform imposed on the prison system.  It was difficult to visit prisons — people were blocked from visiting them.  We made an appeal to judges who had sentenced people to exercise their rights to visit any prison to which they had sent someone.  We made that appeal to try to open up the system.  At that time, the end of the 1970s, the issue was as elementary as getting the prison rules displayed on the wall where a prisoner might see them.  They frequently went up before the visiting committees arrived — these were jokes.  I am in favour of people being assisted who want to run prisons and that the best conditions are made available to those who have to look after prisoners.  However, the visiting committees were, and remain, a disastrous failure.  They were more an invention to secure expenses for political hacks than to make any contribution to the prison system.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">After the prison rules appeared on the wall, so-called informal rules came into play.  I recall a women's prison in which there were rules that were not written down about the number of times a prisoner could wash her hair, about not wearing any jewellery or make-up and the number of times she could change her underwear, etc.  They were all put in as informal degradations that were additional to anything that was formal.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Another issue arose in our examination of prison conditions at that time and continued through the Whitaker report.  It looked at something the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice also examined, namely, the reason people were in prison at all.  We looked at women prisoners in particular and the reasons they were in prison.  One could see that if ever there was a case for non-custodial sentences and alternatives to prison, they were staring us in the face in terms of the reasons so many women had been convicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">We moved on to something which I welcomed, the Dóchas centre which was an advanced system that was successful.  I congratulate the people involved in terms of the reports published by those who have been caring for prisoners as well as those who have experience of being in prison and used the opportunity to turn around their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I have been a Member of this House for more than 20 years.  Shortly after I arrived in 1981, I gave a speech about what a condemnation of Ireland it was that the slopping out practice, which is still going on at Mountjoy, was being retained.  Slopping out is a very interesting phenomenon in the context of the sociology of prison.  It is the last change in every reformed system in Europe.  It is kept because it is a significant degrading ritual and for that reason only.  As I have pointed out, in a professional capacity, I have looked at reform systems in many countries in Europe and I noticed that this is always the last one to be changed because people hold on to it as a significant invasion of the prisoner's life.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">It might be said that this new prison will eliminate these degrading practices for which Ireland has been rightly condemned by one Human Rights Commission report after another.  It would be ridiculous not to welcome better provision as regards space or making it unnecessary for people to double up and have multiple occupancy of cells, which places prisoners at risk.  However, we are discussing this as a planning matter without having discussed the alternatives to prison and the future structure of penal policy.  We have not looked at the management system that would prevail or any of the guarantees which are necessary regarding the integrated use of the units to be formed on the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">The idea that Thornton Hall will be used as a place of detention for refugees who enjoy guarantees under international law is absolutely outrageous.  In addition, at a time when we are trying to reform the health sector, the idea that mental illness is to be linked in such a strong way with the notion of a prison setting is an outrageous and regressive act regarding not just penal policy, but also health.  I appeal for a return of interest of all Members of the Oireachtas in prison welfare because the welfare of prisoners is one of the fundamental tests of rights.  Those who care for prisoners deserve resources, but they also need to have the benefit of modern thinking, which is towards smaller prisons, where there is immediate care for illness and addictions and a real opportunity for prisoners to re-enter society.  None of this is happening, except putting it out in the wilderness, shuttling people out and making it difficult to visit.  This is to say nothing about the high level of illiteracy in prisons which is an indictment of everybody.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_345">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_885">I thank Deputies for the constructive remarks some of them have made.  I do not accept that proper time has not been given to considering this matter.  Of all the discussions about prison building in the State, this has been the longest running process of consultation.  It started in late February, and the resolution has been before the House for over a month.  I have spoken on it both in the House and at the Joint Committee for Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">Regarding prison capacity, I accept that Deputies who represent areas near the proposed site are concerned.  The reality, however, is there will be some concern no matter where a prison is built.  Unfortunately, that is the nature of the world in which we live.  However, the Government must provide proper facilities to which people such as Whitaker and Deputy Higgins, when he was on that alleged self-appointed committee, aspire.  Since 1997, when the Government came into office, some 1,300 extra prison places have been provided.  We must be given some credit for the fact that when we came to office there were 2,316 prison places and today there are just under 3,600.  As we speak, work is at an extremely advanced stage on refurbishing or replacing existing cells in Portlaoise, Castlerea, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey.  Work will soon start on a new block in Wheatfield to provide 144 extra places and an invitation to tender will have issued as regards the complex at Thornton Hall.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of the community service scheme run by the probation and welfare service which is under review.  A final draft of the report on the review will be available by the end of July which I will make available to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Several Deputies, particularly Deputy Naughten, raised the issue of asylum seekers and deportees being kept at the proposed site.  As I said at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, there will be capacity to allow for the detention of deportees in this facility.  However, it will be segregated detention and will facilitate their deportation.  Currently, deportees are held at prisons such as Cloverhill where they are not segregated from the prison population.  Strict time limits are in place as to how long a deportee can be held.  Provision will not be made in the prison for asylum seekers <i>per se</i>.  However, I cannot say some asylum seekers may not be imprisoned there for other offences, as they are obliged to comply with the State’s criminal law.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">The issue of public private partnerships was raised by several Deputies.  As I said at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, it has never been my <i>modus operandi</i> in any ministry I have held to participate or involve myself in contracting and I do not intend to change it in this ministry.  However, I wish the public private partnership issue to be dealt with as expeditiously as possible to ensure the taxpayer gets a proper return with no overspend.  The Opposition would be the first to object if there was an overspend on this project.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The invitation to tender specified that it was to be a design-build-maintain project.  Any Member who suggests this is a move to privatise the running of the prison is living in cloud-cuckoo-land.  I agree with Deputy Higgins who went into some detail on the American prison system.  I would never envisage that happening in Ireland.  The Irish Prison Service is excellent and I see no change in its position.</p>

This is not the same as any other prison development as it is a public private partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Maintenance simply means the maintenance of the buildings and plant, nothing else.  The Irish Prison Service will continue to have full operational responsibility for the running of the prison and interaction with prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The preferred bidder is a consortium of McNamara, Barclays Private Equity and GSL.  It will build the prison and receive no payment until it is built and handed over in working order.

Regarding the Thornton Hall proposal, no contract has been signed and no information which could help a bidder in any way can be revealed.  The public private partnership process requires strict financial assessment of both the project and bidders.  The preferred bidder is assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure it has the operational and financial capacity to deliver the project.  There is no indication of any problem in this regard.  Any effort by Members on the other side of the House to link this consortium with some difficulties with Dublin City Council in another project is not comparing like with like.</p>

          <p eId="para_916">The Government made a decision that when the Thornton Hall site was purchased, 20 acres would be set aside for the Central Mental Hospital.  There is agreement on both sides of the House that the existing hospital in Dundrum needs to be replaced with a new facility.  A project team was established by the Department of Health and Children which recommended that a new site should be located with ready access to the M50.  In the Government's opinion, the Thornton Hall site meets that criterion.  There will be no extra cost to the Exchequer and the sale of the Dundrum site would release considerable sums for investment in the mental health service, the Cinderella of the health service for many years.</p>

As I said at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, the Dóchas issue sticks out like a sore thumb.  If one looks at the percentage of bed capacity over an extended period, there is gross overcapacity at the Dóchas Centre, over which I am not prepared to stand.  Many of the measures advocated in the Baroness Corston report are being implemented in the centre.  It has a successful regime which will be transferred to the Thornton Hall site.  It must be remembered that the Corston report was prompted by suicide rates in the UK prison system.  Suicide is not as prevalent among the Irish female prison population.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I would a hazard a guess that the former and current Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention — the late Mr. Justice Kinlen and Judge Michael Reilly — would accept that the regime proposed for the Thornton Hall site represents an acceptable way of providing extra capacity in the prisons.  The Government is not prepared to stand over a position where there will be a revolving door in the prisons, as was exactly the case when Deputy Burton's party was in government.  Then 20% of the prison population were on temporary release.  The Government is not prepared to accept this.</p>

          <p eId="para_924">The Minister has admitted the State has never before engaged in a public private partnership process for the building of a prison.  He has refused to explain the design element and sought comfort in the excuse that security issues are involved.  Will he elaborate on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_925">Several issues arise as regards the maintenance of the prison and require explanation.  What will its maintenance by private builders mean in the running of the prison, contracts for works and services?  How will this impact on the day to day operation of the prison?  How can it be guaranteed for those in the prison, both prisoners and workers, that services in operation on the first day will not be allowed disintegrate, considering the Department or the Irish Prison Service would not appear to have any responsibility, engagement or involvement in the maintenance of this prison?  This is a worrying aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">I refer to a matter that has not been mentioned, which is the provision of health services.  Mountjoy Prison, St. Patrick's Institution and Dóchas are in close proximity to the Mater Hospital and there has always been an active engagement between them.  Portlaoise Prison and the Midlands Prison are across the road from the Midlands Regional Hospital in Portlaoise and similarly there has been active engagement between the two.  Having regard to what has been said earlier about the roads and the remoteness of the proposed prison location, what arrangements will be set in train to ensure a proper and adequate medical service for those who may wish to avail of it or for those who need it?</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Regrettably the Minister did not answer my question as to the reason consideration was not given towards extending Dóchas.  I recently visited a constituent in Dóchas who was imprisoned for a civil matter.  She informed me that before she was transported by gardaí from her home in County Laois to the prison, she was visited on two occasions by two different officials of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as she is a farmer.  They inquired as to the welfare of her livestock and her cattle.  This was a woman whose daughter is sitting the leaving certificate and whose other 12 year-old daughter has special needs but nobody from the social services called nor anyone from the health services nor any other Department, other than two officials expressing concern as to the welfare of the cattle.  This is the type of prison regime under the Minister's stewardship.  It is disgraceful that any woman or citizen of this State should be treated in such a manner.  Why has the Minister opted not to extend Dóchas, which by all accounts is a prison of acceptable standard where best international practice obtains?  He is now casting it into the wilderness by moving women out, against international best practice, into Thornton Hall.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_377" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_928">The maintenance is to do with the building and is nothing to do with the running of the prison and the interaction with prisoners.  The issue of having maintenance as part of the contract and the transferring of risk to the contractor is a core element of these PPPs.  Over the 25 years of the contract period, the maintenance aspect is part of the transfer of risk to the contractor.  It would be a very good contract for a contractor if there were to be no transfer of risk.  The contract is to design, hand over and take responsibility for the maintenance of the building.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">On the issue of health services, a medical wing will be situated in the prison.  Blanchardstown hospital is close by and this will be the hospital to which people will go.  While the prison system has been subject to criticism over the years which has been justified in many cases, the figures I quoted earlier show this Government has invested significantly in the provision of extra prison spaces.  I understand an extra 80 staff were recently granted to the probation and welfare service to build up the service.  I refer to the statistics provided at the joint committee meeting that approximately 10% of those who come before the courts are given custodial sentences.  The responsibility for deciding who goes to prison is with the courts and has nothing to do with us.  Our responsibility is to provide safe and secure facilities for prisoners.  Successive Governments have overseen situations where there has been gross overcrowding in prisons.  We are not prepared to allow this to happen and the investment has been made and will continue over the next number of years.</p>

          <p eId="para_930">I presume colleagues saw last night that Jim Norton won a very well-merited Tony award.  We remember him fondly from his role as the bishop in "Father Ted".  The more I watch the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and given his obvious officer material, the more he reminds me of Bishop Len.  He refuses to engage in the same language as the rest of us.  We keep asking him questions and he keeps avoiding them.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">I refer to this PPP.  It is clear the Minister has not read Newton Emerson on PPPs and I would recommend that he should.  We are trying to establish whether the Minister is satisfied that a developer involved in controversy, who has withdrawn from five contracts in the public sector, will have any implications for this building project.  Three times today the Minister has told me, over-piously, "I do not involve myself in tendering".  I am not asking him to involve himself in tendering so I advise him to get down off his episcopal pedestal and tell the House whether he is satisfied that Bernard McNamara will not do what he did in the city and walk out because we changed the design of some element of the prison and so leave us with a mess on our hands.  This is a reasonable question and all I want is the answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">We also want to know the answer to the question of the detention of youths at Thornton Hall.  What is the Minister saying?  Is he saying it is likely because Lusk is behind this project in planning terms, or so the Minister said today, that we are likely for a temporary period to detain youths at Thornton Hall?  This would seem to me to envisage an extraordinarily long time span for the construction or reconstruction of Lusk.  What is the Minister's position?  Is he saying that in any event, it is not the medium-term intention that young people will be detained at Kilsallaghan?  If I were Minister, I would ensure I was briefed on these questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The Minister dealt with Deputy O'Rourke when he said she had asked a question about the community service scheme.  I was here listening to Deputy O'Rourke and she did not major in that subject; she asked the Minister why he was moving Dóchas.  She gave the House a long peroration on why we should keep Dóchas where it is and he chose to ignore the lady.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">I thank Deputy Flanagan.  She made a plea to the Minister and he ignored her plea.  Is it the economic consideration of the development value of the Mountjoy site that is causing the Minister to move Dóchas out to Kilsallaghan?  I would appreciate a reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">Has the OPW been commissioned to design and produce the Garda station promised by the Minister?  I have sought information on this matter on a few occasions.  Will the OPW do it and has it been commissioned to do so?  When does the Minister envisage that the light will be put up outside the Garda station?  Will he give us a ballpark time for that?</p>
          <p eId="para_939">Earlier today, the Minister told me in committee that the prison at Thornton Hall is being designed by the OPW.  Having received a note on it, the Minister corrected the record some time later, saying that the OPW is excluded.  The OPW had gone into great detail to design a model for the refurbished Mountjoy and had acquired much familiarity with it so why has it been excluded?  As we do not have time to go into the detailed matters of concern that residents raised, I ask the Minister to meet them to see if further progress can be made on those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">I also wish to raise the question of drugs treatment.  We are told that 70% of prisoners either have a drink — many of us have that, but they have it more seriously — or a drugs problem.  What will be done in the case of Kilsallaghan that will be different in terms of drug treatment and rehabilitation?  Will the Minister describe that and put it on the record of the House, since this is the last opportunity we will get to do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_941">Earlier today, I paraphrased Senator Joe O'Toole but did not have the precise quotation.  I have the quote now, however.  The Opposition has been confronted with a mysterious situation whereby we went into committee on this matter but could not find anybody who was promoting the project.  The Minister was not there initially and his backbenchers disowned it.  They also disowned any discussion of prison policy or reform in the prison service.  Senator Joe O'Toole said: "If there was a survey, they would be 100% against it".  Given the temperature out there, the Minister should sit down with the reasonable citizens to see if further progress can be made.  They have presented us with geological evidence that indicates a waterlogging problem in the area.  I do not have any knowledge about that, but surely the Minister can meet the residents to see if they can be assuaged on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Will the Minister clarify something for me?  Did he say there will be a 100-bed unit for the detention of persons not indigenous to this island?  Will he explain that to me?  Who exactly is it intended might be detained there?  Are they immigrants who will not lawfully be resident in the State under the new Immigration and Residence Bill when it is enacted?  Are they some potential asylum seekers?  I still do not understand that.  The Minister referred to deportees, but can we have an explanation?</p>

It makes absolutely no sense from a financial or operational viewpoint.

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_962">The proposal is a farce.  As time is running out, I will confine my contribution to asking a small number of the questions raised by residents.  We tried to glean from the Minister whether he is willing to move on these issues.  Will the Minister supply residents with the report he cited in committee today from engineering consultants who stated that any local flooding was probably caused by insufficient maintenance of existing land drains?  This would allow residents to refute its contents.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">If the Minister alters in any way the proposals before us — there is no point in consulting residents unless he proposes to address some of their concerns — will he revert to the House or are the proposals to which he hopes the House will sign up tonight a <i>fait accompli</i>?  Will Deputies have an opportunity to discuss the matter again in the event of amendments being made to the proposals?</p>
          <p eId="para_964">Can the Minister guarantee that the wall will not be more than 7.2 m in height?  In the application the figure is preceded by the word "approximately", which I have never seen used in any type of planning application.  What will be the exact height of the wall — 8 m, 7.2 m or 6 m?  These are simple questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">Is the Minister willing to consider reducing the sterile area or <i>cordon sanitaire</i> from the proposed distance of 120 ft. or 40 m?   I do not understand the reason two walls are required, given the proposal to fit electronic surveillance systems and so forth.  Erecting the second wall closer to the first wall would at least allow residents a little more breathing space.  What will be the height of the control tower about which the Minister forgot to tell the committee?  Will it be two, three or four storeys?</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Deputies referred to Dóchas.  In the event that the facility at Lusk is not built, would it be appropriate to allow young people who are incarcerated to be housed close to their families in the Dóchas facility?  Has the Minister considered this and other options?  From the information supplied to me, it appears he has not considered options other than the Ceaucescu type proposal made by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">Will the 100-bed segregated unit be left empty pending the day when 100 people are picked up and placed in it?  Is Bernard McNamara still a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and does his membership of the party have any implications in terms of being a preferred bidder?</p>

          <p eId="para_984">On the issue of flooding, in the context of the liaison committee I have no doubt the Irish Prison Service and consultants will provide information from the report on the relevant aspects of flooding.  I ask everyone, including Deputies from the constituency, to exhort those who have property in the vicinity to allow access, if required, to clean out drains.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">The concerns raised by residents relate to operational issues.  I have given a commitment to establish a liaison committee which could deal with their concerns.  I do not envisage any major amendments being made to the proposals, nor do I envisage it being necessary to revert to the House in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">On the <i>cordon sanitaire</i>, we are not prepared to reduce its size from the existing distance of 40 m.  However, in certain locations where it is contiguous to houses, it has been narrowed to allay some of the fears of residents.  I assure Deputy Ó Snodaigh that I have been very up-front on the issue of the height of the buildings.  I indicated at previous committee meetings that every building will be two storeys in height, apart from the tower, which will be three storeys high.  The facility will not be an obtrusive building from a height point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">The 100-bed unit will be held vacant in the early stages but may well over time be required for extra prison space.  As I stated, it is normal practice to have a facility of this type.  It is better that anyone who may be deported be placed in a specific location in a detention centre where he or she will not mix with the normal prisoner population.</p>

Will he explain the concept of the transfer of risk, given that the Department is the guaranteed purchaser of the services of the PPP and our children and grandchildren will be paying for it in 25 years?  The Minister is most famous for having spent considerable time up trees in north County Dublin.  When he was up those trees, how much of Thornton did he see?</p>

          <speech by="#TomMcEllistrimFF" eId="spk_434">
            <from>Deputy Thomas McEllistrim</from>
            <p eId="para_1278">I call on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to introduce European studies along with civic, social and political education, CSPE, as a subject at second level for the leaving certificate curriculum.  Irish membership of the European Union has had profound economic, social, political and cultural consequences.  In 1973, Ireland was among the poorest, least developed member states and one of the most reliant upon small-scale agricultural production.  Our position has been transformed within a generation to one in which Ireland is one of the most successful economies in the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">If the experience of canvassing for a referendum on the Lisbon treaty has taught us anything, it is that despite our application for membership of the European project in 1961 by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Sean Lemass, some 47 years ago, we know and understand relatively little of its structures and procedures.  How many times have we heard people claim, especially over the last few months, to be unable to understand the treaty since the campaign for this referendum first began?  How often have people dismissed the text of the treaty as technical and difficult?  That is because it is technical, difficult and legalistic.  As this treaty is about changes to structures, rules and procedures, we have found it necessary to try to explain what those structures are in the first place.  If people are not fully aware of the functions of the three pillars of the European Union, for example, how can we expect them to understand or make judgments on changes to the way in which they work?</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">It is disempowering to be deprived of the understanding of how the social and political world actually works.  A lack of political and social science education reduces people's choices as political actors in society.  When understanding is missing it results in a lack of ownership of the political process.  Democracy is undermined when the people do not understand its structures and rules.  We have only begun to understand and respect the people's right to information and familiarisation with political structures in our own country.  Great strides have been made to improve political, social and personal education in recent years.  The targeting of younger people through the curriculum will benefit generations to come.  The development of social, personal and health education, SPHE, in primary schools, CSPE at post primary level and the great work involved with Comhairle na nÓg and Dáil na nÓg have all played a part in educating our young people in politics and society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">The recent development of a schools programme about the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas is commendable and we can see from the extraordinary response of the public and the demand for tickets for the inaugural Oireachtas family day event that an appetite for information clearly exists.  Some 4,000 people registered for the event within hours of the tickets becoming available.  Members of the public have clearly shown that they want to connect with the centre of politics and it behoves us as parliamentarians to facilitate connection and communication, not just with the Oireachtas but with the European Union as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">There is a need to bring European studies into second level education as a subject in its own right, unless it could be incorporated with CSPE which is taught up to junior certificate level and could be extended to leaving certificate level.  Such a development would widen the opportunity for future generations to learn about and better understand the European Union and our place within it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">Much has been written in recent weeks in the media about how successful Irish representatives, senior officials and interest groups have been in their dealings with EU institutions and our European partners.  Such people know how the Union works and how to interact effectively with our European partners to achieve our policy goals.  We should not rest on our laurels.  We should be preparing future generations for their place in Europe.  How better to ensure that the European Union and its structures are clearly understood than by teaching about it in our schools?</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">Confining EU studies to third level automatically reduces the level of participation.  European studies should be a choice of subject at all third level institutes of technology and universities.  The availability of European studies at second level would widen the participation and significantly enhance our knowledge of the European Union and its structures and procedures, which are very important to our daily lives.  A reasoned and reasonable debate can only be fostered if, as a society, we have a better understanding of what our political systems are and how they work.  Opportunities for debate and discussion should not be confined to a month or two before a referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">We need to develop greater awareness at all levels about the European Union, whether through schools or through public information programmes.  Our second level schools are a good place to start.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to consider that the Government should seriously examine introducing European studies as a subject at second level.  The subject could also be introduced on a pilot basis in second level schools, for example in Limerick West in the towns of Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West, or in Kerry North in Listowel or Tralee.  The better informed we are, the more engaged we will be and the better decisions we can make.  Our democracy could only be the better for this.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1286">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been established to advise the Department on the curriculum for primary and second level schools.  The council has no plans at present to introduce European studies as a subject in the leaving certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287">Civic, social and political education is a mandatory subject for all students in the junior cycle and is an examination subject which is assessed through a written paper and an action project.  The aim of the action project is to give students practical experience of active citizenship.  This includes fostering a sense of belonging and awareness of social inclusion and justice issues, a capacity to gain access to information and structures relating to the society in which they live and an ability and confidence to participate in democratic society.  Students choose a theme for their action project which is designed around the skills of identification and awareness of a social justice issue, planning, research, analysis and evaluation, reporting and engaging in joint action which develop social and political skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">CSPE is based on seven basic concepts, which ought to underpin all citizenship-based activity in our communities, not just our schools.  These concepts are human dignity, rights and responsibilities, stewardship, development, democracy, the law and interdependence.  There are four units in the programme — the individual and citizenship, the community action project, the State, and Ireland and the world.  Topical issues in the latter unit are the EU and its structures, including the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Europe.  In addition, subjects like history, geography, science, music and art include a European dimension and the languages offered in second level schools provide for a cultural awareness component.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">The report of the task force on active citizenship includes a recommendation on the development of a senior cycle programme on citizenship for schools.  Since 2005, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been involved in an intensive phase of planning and development in key areas of the senior cycle.  A new subject, politics and society, which is proposed as an optional examinable full subject, is being developed.  A background paper on social and political education in senior cycle has been published for consultation.  A report on the consultation process was completed in May 2007.  Both reports are available on the council's website, <i>www.ncca.ie</i>.  Development work is continuing.  The Minister for Education and Science has not yet received formal proposals on the matter from the council.  He looks forward to receiving its advice on this issue at an early date.  In addition, the “in search of Europe” module is commonly offered in the transition year programme.  The programme, which is followed by over 28,000 students, is a flexible framework by means of which schools can offer optional modules which encourage personal development, active learning, social awareness and community participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">The European studies curriculum development project was established in 1986 by the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, the Department of Education and Science in Ireland and the Department for Education and Employment in the UK.  The project is jointly funded by the education departments in Northern Ireland and Ireland.  The overall aim of the project is to encourage co-operation between participating students and staff and to contribute to educational development in the wider dimension of the European Community.  It informs students about current social economic and political issues and structures at national and European level.  Some 282 schools from 24 jurisdictions participate in the European studies project.  The highest participation levels are in Northern Ireland, where 81 schools are participating, and the Republic, where 71 schools are participating.  The schools work in clusters of five or six.  Each cluster must have two schools from Northern Ireland — one from each tradition — and a school from Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">Various units of study and topics in the junior and senior programmes have been designed to assist students in examining areas of shared interest today and areas of conflict in the past.  They are intended to broaden the students' knowledge and understanding of their own place and their relationship to others in the Europe of today.  The junior programme, which is curriculum-based, offers units of study supported by specially produced materials in the areas of English, geography and history.  It uses English as its language of communication and is confined to students between the ages of 11 and 15.  The senior programme, which can be adapted to meet the needs of students aged 15 years and over, is a one-year course of study.  It is cross-curricular in scope and allows students and their teachers to choose from a range of topics with economic, political, cultural, technological, social and environmental perspectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">The Minister for Education and Science is waiting for the NCCA to outline examples of its proposals to include short courses in the leaving certificate examination.  The implications of those proposals in terms of teacher qualifications, assessment and resources will have to be determined.  If such courses are approved, they will provide a vehicle by means of which this issue may be further explored.  However, I am satisfied that the current curriculum, allied with future development of a subject on politics and society, will provide a strong basis through which the study of the role of the European Union and its culture, structures, history and impact can be progressed.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_436">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1293">I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise this outrageous case, which relates to the interpretation of Article 4.5 of the guidelines for the 2007 higher education grants scheme.  The parents of the student who is involved in the case, Michael Ikerionwu, were granted permission to stay in this country for three years, renewable by applying in the final month of the third year.  Mr. Ikerionwu, along with his father, mother and brother, was granted permission to stay.  Article 4.5 of the guidelines state that a person applying for a higher education must have EU nationality, have official refugee status, have been given humanitarian leave to remain in the State prior to the Immigration Act 1999, or be a person in respect of whom the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has granted permission to remain following a determination not to make a deportation order.  Mr. Ikerionwu was initially refused a grant by Galway County Council.  The case was appealed by his parents to the council, but that appeal was lost.  They then appealed to the Minister, on my advice.  I appealed the decision to the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, but I have yet to receive a reply.  The student received a reply, however.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">I received a letter from a staff officer in Galway County Council after I made my appeal.  I wish to refer to the letter sent to me by Martina Maloney of Galway County Council.  The letter refers to my representations on behalf of Mr. Ikerionwu, who applied for a higher education grant for the 2007-08 academic year.  I was told that as the student did not have official refugee status, his details had been referred to the Department of Education and Science to ascertain whether he met the criteria of Article 4.5 of the higher education grants scheme.  The council was advised by the Department that the student did not meet the criteria.  The student was informed on the basis of that advice that he was not eligible for a grant for the 2007-08 academic year.  The council informed me that, on receipt of my representations, it re-examined the student's application and endeavoured to get details of his status from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The council was informed by that Department's repatriation unit, after numerous requests for final confirmation of his status, that the student complied with the scheme's necessary requirements.  The letter from the council said it was pleased to inform me that it intended to award the student a higher education grant for the 2007-08 academic year, on receipt of some documentation regarding his parents' rent allowance for the 2006 tax year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">That letter was sent to me on 10 April last and the student in question received a letter confirming his grant on 11 April.  However, he received a further letter from Galway County Council on 29 May.  The letter referred to Mr. Ikerionwu's higher education grant application and to the council's letter of 11 April 2008.  That was the letter which informed him that the council had reviewed his application, based on information received from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The letter of 29 May said that the council had been informed by the Department of Education and Science that the information received regarding the student's residency status was not sufficient.  According to that letter, the council regretted to inform Mr. Ikerionwu that it was unable to award him a grant for the 2007-08 academic year.  The letter contained an apology from the council for any inconvenience that its decision may cause.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">We have sought an interpretation.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had told me, the student and Galway County Council that it had decided that the student qualified for a grant under Article 4.5.  The Department of Education and Science over-ruled that decision.  The student, having applied for a grant, been refused the grant, appealed that decision and then been granted the grant, had it taken from him six weeks later.  Given that he is making an incredible effort to pursue his third level studies, the reversal of the original decision makes a mockery of integration.  It is an outrageous contradiction, after the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had written to me, the county council and the student to outline its ruling, that the Department of Education and Science has taken back the grant that had been awarded under appeal.</p>

            <p eId="para_1303">The Deputy will be aware that the Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students.  These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees.  Under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">In the case of the individual referred to by the Deputy, the decision on eligibility for third level grants was a matter for Galway County Council.  Its initial decision, advised to the candidate referred to by the Deputy on 21 February 2008, was that he did not satisfy the nationality requirement of the higher education grant scheme.  Following an initial appeal of this decision to the local authority, Galway County Council again wrote to the candidate on 19 March 2008 advising that the decision remained unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">On 10 April 2008, a notice of appeal was received from the candidate by the Department.  The Department responded to the candidate on 18 April 2008 advising that the letter from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of an application for temporary leave to remain in the State stated that a decision had been made to grant "temporary leave to remain in the State" in this instance.  This condition is not one of those specified under the nationality clause of the maintenance grant schemes.  On that basis, the Department upheld the original decision, and decision on appeal, of Galway County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">The Department is aware that, following Galway County Council's decision on appeal, the council reviewed the application based on e-mail correspondence with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is the practice that clarification required in regard to nationality issues for grant eligibility is referred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the Department in the first instance.  In the circumstances, the Department has recently made contact with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of this case.  A formal written request for clarification will issue from the Department to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish more clearly the grounds on which the candidate was granted temporary leave to remain in the State.  The Department will correspond directly with the candidate and with Galway County Council, if necessary, following clarification from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1312">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  The people of Ennis, parents, staff and pupils, are angry, frustrated and absolutely disgusted at the lack of progress in regard to the provision of a new school building for Ennis national school.  Ennis is the county town of Clare, the tidiest town in Ireland, as we were told this week.  It is the information age town of Ireland.  It is supposed to be the fastest growing town in Ireland.  Yet, the position of Ennis national school has remained unchanged for the past ten years — ten years of economic boom which has been squandered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">Ennis national school should be a model for all other schools in County Clare.  It should the flagship school.  Some 700 pupils attend Ennis national school, which has more prefabs than classrooms.  This is a public disgrace.  I recently invited Deputy Brian Hayes, the Fine Gael spokesperson on education, to Ennis national school.  He was absolutely flabbergasted at what he saw.  He said — and he was not exaggerating — that it was the worst case he had ever seen and he has travelled the length and breadth of Ireland.  It is shocking that a school should have more prefabs than classrooms.  It is not acceptable that pupils are being taught in prefabs and in corridors, that they are asked on a daily basis to attend a school that is clearly 20 years past its sell-by date.  The principal, Mr. Gary Stack, is correct that Ennis national school is a monument to institutionalised neglect during the past ten years.  The people of Ennis need a solution to the crisis that is Ennis national school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">As I stated earlier, the population of Ennis has increased by 25% since 1999.  Ennis, a rapidly expanding area, is every bit as deserving of a school as Dublin, Kildare and Meath.  The board of management has played its part.  The Bishop of Killaloe has provided a site for playing fields and Ennis town council has rezoned a site for the school.  I ask that the Minister for Education and Science visit Ennis national school with a view to moving this project to tender stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_1315">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputy Carey and me to raise this important matter in the House.  When our spokesperson on education and science, Deputy Brian Hayes, recently visited Ennis national school at our invitation, he was appalled at what he saw.  This school was declared by the INTO in 2003 as substandard on health and safety grounds.  Little has changed in the intervening five years.  Located at a very dangerous junction, it is more like a concentration camp in appearance than the capital town's primary place of education for its children.  It is a nightmare, with 16 prefabs littered all over the yard.  A musty smell greets one at the entrance and the flat roof leaks with every downpour.  These are Third World conditions indeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">Children and teachers are forced to battle all types of weather to access their classes.  I do not know how the principal, Gary Stack, his teachers and pupils put up with this situation.  The Department's school buildings programme is a shambles<b>.  </b>This school was originally built in 1971-2 as a 16 classroom school with 40 teachers.  The population of Ennis increased from 1996 to 2006 at twice the rate of that of the country as a whole and now stands at 28,704.  If this rate of increase continues there will be 38,000 people living in Ennis by 2015.  In the Ennis area alone, there are more than 70 prefabs in use, which is a disgrace<b>. </b> The Department is spending €35 million on rent for temporary accommodation while conditions at schools like Ennis national school are deteriorating fast.  In February this year, permission was sought and obtained from the Department for two new teachers at the school.  However, the Minister is refusing to fund the €300 weekly payment required to provide a shared prefab to accommodate the teachers.  The reason given for not funding the prefab is “the school has not shown an accommodation need.”  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, should come down from his ivory tower in Dublin and visit Ennis national school and see if he could work in these conditions. The penny-pinching of his Department means that these two teachers are forced to work in the school corridors.  This would not happen even in Mugabe’s Zimbabwe.  The Department’s copy book is blotted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">The Minister has no plan, no direction and no ideas.  One arm of his Department does not know what the other is doing.  Earlier this year, the Department finally advertised in the European journal for a design team.  The following day it advised<b> </b>the school that the project would not be going ahead.  On Wednesday, 25 June next, parents will withdraw their children from the school in protest at the conditions.  They are totally frustrated at the lack of action.  A greenfield site is available with zoning and access road infrastructure guaranteed by the diocese and Clare County Council.  Additional lands have been provided by the diocese for the provision of two playing fields.  Successive Ministers during the past 20 years have done nothing but a sticker and plaster job at Ennis national school, with no effect.  It is time the current Minister put in place the foundation blocks for a new school.  I appeal to the Minister to take urgent action to address the situation at Ennis national school.  There is an urgent need for the Minister to act.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_1318">I thank both Deputies for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position with regard to the proposed building project for Ennis national school in Ennis, County Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting, based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">The plan for Ennis national school is to provide it with a new 32 classroom building on a greenfield site.  The Department is providing the building and the diocese is providing the site.  The current enrolment is 670 pupils and the staffing comprises a principal, a deputy administrative principal, 25 mainstream assistants, four learning support teachers, three resource teachers, four temporary language support teachers, one temporary resource teacher for Travellers, and one special class teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">The proposed building project has been assigned a band one rating because of the extent of the deficit of accommodation required to meet the broader needs of the Ennis area, and the next step for this project is the appointment of a design team.  In recent times, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy O'Keeffe, has stated both publicly and to the House that he is not in a position to give the go ahead for any more school building projects, including that for Ennis national school, at the present time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_1323">As he has said before, he does not want to mislead this school or indeed any other school in the same situation by making any suggestions to the contrary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">The Minister is currently in the process of reviewing with his officials the Department's spending plans for this year.  This review will not be complete for some time and he will not be <i> </i>making any decision on further capital expenditure until that process is complete.  Although under the last national development plan over 7,800 building projects were delivered to provide new and modernised educational infrastructure, the reality is that not all needs can be met together under the last national development plan. They must be met incrementally and in order of priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">This is why the Department consulted the education partners with regard to prioritisation criteria for the allocation of large-scale capital funding and why these criteria are published.  They are clear and unambiguous and they bring an openness and transparency as to how projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme.  Not alone has their introduction improved the management of the building programme but they also ensure a clear cut selection process and an orderly advancement, over time, of all school building projects, with the most urgent need being addressed first.  They are subject at all times, however, to the availability of funding.  Having said that, the project for Ennis national school has a band one rating under the Department's prioritisation criteria.  This means that it is well positioned to advance as soon as funding is available.</p>

          <p eId="para_1327">I hope it is not.  With regard to the school's short-term needs, the Department recently refused an application for a portacabin to accommodate a language support teacher and a resource teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">As I have already outlined, the school has 13 ex-quota posts or non-mainstream class teachers overall.  One of these is based in and shared with another school.  Unfortunately, not all applications for temporary accommodation can be approved in a situation when there are tightening economic circumstances.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_1330">In such times, where schools have alternative accommodation, such as a general purposes room or library, as is the case with Ennis national school, this should be used as an interim measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">While the Minister accepts that it is far from ideal for any children to be taught in non-customised accommodation, sometimes this is unavoidable until more favourable economic circumstances prevail.  I hope the school authority will realise that the Department does not refuse demonstrably necessary funding applications unless it is not in a position to do otherwise and that, unfortunately, the situation regarding its temporary accommodation application is unlikely to change this year, particularly given the availability of a short-term resolution to the issue within the school itself.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_1337">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the important issue of Mount Bruis national school in County Tipperary, a school on the outskirts of Tipperary town.  It received a devolved grant for development of the school in February 2007 which was greatly appreciated.  The school personnel were thankful to the then Minister for Education, Deputy Mary Hanafin, for sanctioning that amount of money.  However, they find now that the grant of €485,000 is short of the sum they require.  An additional €282,000 is needed to provide what they applied for initially.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">The Minister of State will understand the times in which we live.  The original application was made in good faith.  Now they find that, because of escalating costs across the board, there is the shortfall I mentioned.  I hear Deputies from various parts of the country looking for attention for schools.  We hear this on a weekly basis and no doubt tomorrow night there will be representations from Deputies for their own areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">This is a school, however, that that has been sanctioned for an extension.  Mount Bruis is a very rural area with a top-class school.  In about nine or ten hours from now, kids will walk into that school and they will not be sure of their future.  There is a huge concern in this area because 12 years ago the parents and board of management and everybody in that area got together to buy land from an adjacent landowner that would faciliate the sports facilities.  These are parents who do not wish for more than is normal, only for the basic amount of money which the Department provided.  However, that must now be augmented to make sure that the job can be completed.  The stark reality facing the school's board of management is a shortfall of €280,000.  They have costed it in every possible way but the grant they received is far less than the sum necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">I am not sure if the Minister of State has the answer tonight to the question I have put before him.  I shall understand if he does not.  I hope, however, that he will give me at least an indication that, at some time in the future, he will be able to give the money required to this school, which has already provided for its own sports facilities.  It is the only school in that catchment area which provides education facilities for primary school children.  They have done everything they should and all that is needed is that the Department of Education and Science should provide the shortfall.  Perhaps the matter I put down was not specific enough in detail and I will understand if the answer is broad but enough to deal with the issue.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_463">
          <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_1341">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity of outlining to this House the Department's position regarding the allocation of funding for Mount Bruis national school, Mount Bruis, County Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">The management authorities of this school applied for and were approved for funding under the 2007 small schools scheme. A grant of €484,000 was sanctioned to enable the provision of extension and the modernisation of the existing school building. The Department moved towards a model of devolving funding, responsibility and authority as appropriate for smallerbuilding projects-refurbishments directly to school management authorities in 2003 with the introduction on a pilot basis of the devolved small schools and permanent accommodation schemes.  Owing to the positive feedback from schools the schemes were extended to include additional schools in subsequent years.  The small schools scheme allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives them control of the building project.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake desired building projects.  The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs but to allow them to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools granted discretion and funding must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">The authorities of the Mount Bruis school accepted the grant offer and returned a form of undertaking agreeing to comply with the requirements of the scheme in March 2007.  A letter and project cost details were received on 1 June 2008 indicating that the school's building proposals would cost €766,000, some €282,000 in excess of the €484,000 on offer to the school.  The school requested that the shortfall be funded by the Department and indicated that it was not possible to downscale its building plan.  This request for significant additional funding was considered in the Department.  However, in line with the original intention of the small schools scheme, it was considered that the school should be encouraged to complete the project within the funding envelope provided and, accordingly, the application for additional grant aid was not granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">In the current economic climate and with considerable demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to entertain such significant increases in the amounts grant aided to schools.  It is the responsibility of the school authorities to manage the resources allocated to them to ensure maximum value for money and to control costs.  The board of management should take the necessary steps to ensure that the scope of the works undertaken matches the funding being allowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">I am sure the Deputy will agree it is important that we ensure grant aid is managed prudently.  As he may be aware, a total of €586 million will be spent under the Department's schools building programme this year alone.  It is important to ensure that costs are kept under control in the construction of school buildings and that those responsible ensure that value for money is achieved for the taxpayer.  In this way, we can ensure completion of the maximum number of projects from within the funds available to the Minister for the schools building programme under the current national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1355">The Government decision in 2005 to extend Metro North to the Swords Area was strongly influenced by the case put forward by Fingal County Council that the provision of high quality rail-based public transport was essential to the future sustainable development of the area. The Government was also influenced by the contribution which the Council's development plans would make to the economic and financial case for Metro North.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">Indeed, Fingal's development plans, which envisage a growth in population of nearly 120% in the next 15 to 20 years, are not possible without Metro North. Furthermore, the implementation of these development plans will strengthen the basis for the Metro project in two important ways. The first is by creating an additional passenger and revenue source for the Metro and the second is through the Council's development levy scheme which will contribute substantially to the capital cost of the extension of Metro North to Swords.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">This welcome outcome is the result of close co-operation between the Railway Procurement Agency and Fingal County Council. It is an example of the type of integrated transport and land use planning that should be followed by other local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">The report referred to in the Deputy's question builds on the work done by the Council in 2005 and concerns the formulation of an economic development strategy for areas which are in the vicinity of Metro North. I welcome this further important initiative by Fingal County Council in developing innovative planning and economic policies which will seek to maximise the benefits to its area presented by the Metro North project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">In relation to the second part of the Deputy's Question, the RPA will publish its assessment of the transportation and related socio-economic impacts of the development of Metro North to coincide with its application for the railway order later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1372">Road Safety is a regular feature of the Transport Sector of the North-South Ministerial Council and progress continues to be made in relation to cross border road safety issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">The area which has been most successful in terms of co-operation relates to the development of joint road safety advertising campaigns.  There are a number of such campaigns active at the moment including the "Just One" (Drink Driving), "Get it On" (Seatbelt Wearing) and "Mess" (Speeding) campaigns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">Work is also continuing on a bilateral agreement to give effect to the EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications by late 2008/early 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">The mutual recognition of penalty points is a longer-term (3-4 year) project, which is being followed up under the auspices of the British Irish Council (BIC).</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">As separate penalty point systems operate in each of the three jurisdictions, this is a much more complex legal and administrative issue than the mutual recognition of driver disqualifications, and will require the passage of primary legislation in both jurisdictions in due course.  A feasibility study on the matter is to be presented to my UK and NI colleagues and myself shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">I am in regular contact with my colleagues in Northern Ireland and the UK and am due to meet both the Northern Ireland and UK Ministers later this month to advance these matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_1379">I would like to clarify at the outset that the buildings in which my Department is accommodated are sourced by the Office of Public Works. The OPW, because of its particular technical expertise, plays the key role in the assessment of the energy efficiency of buildings in State use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">The main step which the OPW takes in the discharge of this  role is the installation of Building Management Systems which records energy consumption data every 15 minutes and which can be used to identify and drive measures to reduce energy consumption. A reduction of 15% is the target for this year and I expect this to be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">I believe that the OPW's emphasis on the acquisition of quality energy consumption data is fully justifiable. Only through the availability of such data can informed decisions be taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">My Department is also participating in an OPW-led Staff Awareness Energy campaign which is designed to make all staff more aware of how their daily actions and habits can contribute to greater efficiency. A number of staff seminars have already been held.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">My Department was the first Government Department to introduce a Work Place Travel Plan. Besides promoting the use of safe, healthy and sustainable travel options, the Department also provides bicycles for use of Department staff as well as improved cycle parking facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">My Department is in the process of appointing Energy Officers for each participating building whose primary responsibility will be to drive good energy saving and house-keeping practices.  Other energy-saving initiatives include participation in the green electricity and annual travel pass schemes.  I wish to assure the Deputy that these efforts will be maintained and intensified into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1386">The decentralisation of 50 Departmental and Road Safety Authority staff to Loughrea was among the priority moves in the Government's programme and was completed in July 2007. Decentralisation of an additional 62 Road Safety Authority posts (which were not part of the original Government decision) to Ballina was also achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">My Department met with the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) on 15 April 2008.  Representatives from each of the agencies under the Department's aegis were also in attendance.  Discussions took place on how best to progress decentralisation to Drogheda along with the various issues facing the agencies and their decentralisation programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">My Department is also required to transfer at least 37 posts to Drogheda and this is being actively pursued. An immediate priority is to acquire a suitable premises and the OPW are pursuing this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">Decentralisation of the National Roads Authority and Railway Safety Commission to Ballinasloe, Bus Éireann to Mitchelstown, and the Irish Aviation Authority to Shannon, although not originally identified as priority moves, are also being addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">In the context of the Expenditure Review undertaken earlier this year, my Department considered the transfer of the 37 posts to Drogheda and concluded that locating a combination of safety investigation functions and other related safety posts there offers very good potential for operational efficiencies and value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391">At its meeting on 27 May the Government agreed to my proposals to relocate the Railway Safety Commission to Drogheda instead of Ballinasloe, and relocate an additional 20 posts of the National Roads Authority to Ballinasloe in order to achieve the Government's targets in respect of those locations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1393">The Executive Committee of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port state control (the Paris MoU) met in Greece during May and decided to admit Ireland to the "White List" in recognition of the significant improvement Ireland has made in recent years in safety standards aboard Irish registered ships.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">Obtaining 'White List' status from the Paris MoU is an international recognition that Ireland operates a quality shipping register.  The "White List" represents quality flags with a consistently low detention record.  No Irish vessel has a detention recorded against it in the Paris MoU Port State Control database for 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">The "White List" status has been achieved through the regular monitoring and inspection of Irish registered vessels carried out by the Marine Survey Office with the active co-operation of the operators of ships flying the Irish flag.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">As regards the carrying out of Port State Control onboard foreign vessels in Irish ports, the number of marine surveyors employed by my Department and qualified to carry out this work currently stands at 22.

            <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1398">In December 2006 the Integrated Ticketing Project Board submitted a comprehensive proposal setting out the timelines, scope and budget for the implementation of an integrated ticketing scheme for the Greater Dublin Area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">Based on this proposal, I am informed that the current position is that the integrated ticketing system will be launched on a phased basis on the services of Dublin Bus, LUAS and Morton's in September 2009.  It will be extended to Irish Rail DART and commuter rail services within a further 12 months, and Bus Éireann on a pilot basis on a number of its commuter routes.  It is also envisaged that other private bus operators will join the scheme over this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">In December 2006, the Project Board put the expected capital cost of the integrated ticketing project at €49.6 million. This was based on pre-tender best estimates at that time in respect of a number of elements of the project. The final costs will become clearer when all public procurement processes are complete and tender prices are known.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">In the light of the progress being made, it appears from the actual tenders received to date, as distinct from previous estimates, that the price is likely to be at a level higher than that provided for in the budget. The position will be clearer once procurements are finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">The Project Board last reported to me in February, 2008, covering the period October to January 2008. Another report is now due. I understand that this will be provided as soon as negotiations on the key back office contract are finalized. In the meantime, I am being kept appraised of ongoing developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">In relation to integrated information, the Dublin Transport Authority, when established, will have responsibility for an Integrated Public Transport Information Scheme. In the meantime, real time passenger information is available on DART, suburban rail and Luas services.  Both Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann are advancing with their plans for the introduction of real time passenger information.</p>

            <p eId="para_1405">At the launch of Transport 21, the Government identified the programmes and projects in the national roads, public transport and regional airports sectors that it wishes to see prioritised for implementation in the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 within an overall capital provision of €34 billion.  That objective has not changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">Significant progress has been made on Transport 21 in its first two years and a number of projects have been completed, are under construction or are well advanced in planning terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">Most national road projects are now being completed ahead of schedule and almost all of the projects opened in 2007 were on or ahead of time, while significant advances have been made on the development of public transport projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">While the majority of projects will be delivered ahead of or in accordance with the indicative timetable published at the launch of Transport 21, the huge scale of the programme is such that adjustments to the timescale for individual projects is inevitable.  The value of the ten-year financial framework is that it gives us the flexibility to deal with this in an effective way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">The necessary revisions to completion dates have arisen for a range of reasons including changes to the scope of projects arising from public consultation, planning issues, procurement issues and archaeological difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_1423">The Metro North project is progressing well. The tender documents were issued to the four bidding consortia last month and the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) has held meetings with these consortia recently.  The bidders are putting their bids together with a view to submitting them towards the end of this year.  The PPP procurement process will select not only the contractor to build Metro North but also the operator.  The bidding consortia include construction, rolling stock and operating companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">Detailed planning and design work on the project is ongoing and the RPA expects to lodge an application with An Bórd Pleanála for a railway order in the current year.  The target date for completion of the project is 2013.  However, this date will be critically determined by the outcome of both the planning and procurement processes.  These processes will also determine when the main project will commence, when a contractor will be appointed, when the project will be completed and when operations will commence. Compulsory purchase powers for the land required will be provided in the railway order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">In January 2008, the Government approved Exchequer funding for advance works which will clear the way for the earliest possible start of the main construction work under the PPP contract. The Government also approved the funding structure for the main Metro North PPP contract.  The required Exchequer funding is in place. The private funding element required under the PPP will be put in place as part of the procurement process I referred to earlier.</p>

            <p eId="para_1432">The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to improving bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private.  This commitment is consistent with recent statements from my Government partners in relation to the reform of the 1932 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">It is my intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals to be contained in the Public Transport Regulation Bill.  At this stage it is too early to be precise on the detail of the proposals except to confirm that the new Bill will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.  The new bus licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU PSO Regulation.  It is envisaged that the new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann, and that the powers to grant licences in the Greater Dublin Area will be given to the Dublin Transport Authority.  The new Bill will also encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the Greater Dublin Area that are consistent with the EU PSO Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">While it is not possible at this time to indicate a precise time as to when the legislative proposals on regulatory reform of the bus market will be published, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, and the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">The Programme for Government also includes a commitment for the examination of the need for a National Transport Regulator in the context of the overall review of the economic regulatory environment.  This review is being progressed on an inter-departmental basis under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>

            <p eId="para_1462">My Department, through the Dublin Transportation Office, funded An Taisce's Green-School's Travel Module on a pilot basis in 2007.  The pilot, which involved 49 schools and 20,000 pupils in the Greater Dublin Area, delivered an average 10% decline in car use for school journeys — the decline was replaced by an 8% increase in walking/cycling and 1% increases in use of public transport and mixed mode travel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">A week ago I announced that my Department, in association with the DTO, will increase funding to the Module to €2 million in 2008.  Subject to continued progress, I will maintain funding to the Module on an annual basis up to 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">Through this financial commitment I hope to achieve:</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">Expansion in the number of participating schools from 49 in 2007 to 274 in 2008 and rising incrementally to over 1,150 in 2012;</p>

            <p eId="para_1467">Cycle training delivered in schools;</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">Extension of coverage from the Greater Dublin Area in 2007 to all provinces in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">My Department has provided funding to the DTO for the One Small Step campaign.  It encourages drivers in the Greater Dublin Area to examine their car usage patterns and to think about using other ways of getting around, such as walking, cycling or public transport, whenever they can.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">The campaign promotes cycling and walking as one of the best ways of getting fresh air, regular exercise, saving money, saving journey time and benefiting the local and general environment.  The campaign involves a number of organisations both public and private sector.  As part of the campaign my Department has produced a workplace travel plan to promote alternative ways for staff to get to and from work.</p>

            <p eId="para_1472">An element of STTAP is likely to require significant modal shift from the private car to walking, cycling and public transport. In parallel with the preparation of STTAP, the Department commissioned research to help in the development of a National Cycle Policy, through the implementation of which I hope to have 10% of all trips made by bicycle by 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_1478">The National Development Plan provides for a comprehensive study of the role of Dublin Port, taking account of locational considerations, in the context of overall ports policy on the island of Ireland, wider transport policy, urban development policy, the National Spatial Strategy and national economic policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">My Department is in the process of recruiting consultants to carry out the study. It is intended to have the study completed within a six-month period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">Dublin Port is a vital piece of economic infrastructure. In tonnage terms, it handles roughly 40% of the seaborne trade in and out of the State. In value terms it is even more significant. In 2006, it handled 79% of the State's RoRo traffic and 62% of the container traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">Clearly, the future role of Dublin Port is of major strategic importance to the economy. It is much more than a local or regional issue and requires further examination at a strategic level. The study of the port under the NDP will provide this strategic level examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">The Ports Policy Statement was published in 2005. Ports policy continues to be implemented as outlined in the statement and I have no plans to bring forward a Green Paper on the subject for the present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">In January 2008, the Government approved the General Scheme of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill. The Bill is currently being drafted and I expect to have it published in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">The Bill will further support implementation of national ports policy and will update existing legislation.  The Bill will, inter alia, facilitate development by Drogheda Port Company of a proposed new port facility at Bremore in Fingal County and any similar development that may arise in the future in respect of other ports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">Drogheda Port Company has selected a joint venture partner to progress the Bremore proposal. The Joint Venture proposal is in line with established ports policy. The further feasibility, commercial and regulatory work required for such a proposal is being advanced at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_1491">The State Airports Act, 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports. As part of the airport restructuring process the boards of Cork and Shannon airport are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">Draft business plans for Cork and Shannon were submitted to the DAA at the end of last year and subsequently forwarded to me with DAA's commentary.  Consideration of the draft Cork business plan led to the Cassells report which was the outcome of dialogue with the Dublin Airport Authority and the Cork Airport Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">Following on from acceptance of the Cassells report by the Board of CAA in April last, a process of engagement has commenced with all the relevant parties on its implementation. It is my intention to proceed to effect the full separation of the three State airports, as set out in the State Airports Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">This process involves the preparation of revised business plans, taking account of the Cassells' recommendations in the case of Cork. In due course, the business plans will be submitted to me and the Minister for Finance for approval as regards the financial and operational readiness of the airports. As this process has not yet been completed, I do not propose to comment in detail on the specific issues raised by the Deputy. However, I would emphasise that it remains Government policy that the State Airports should operate to a commercial mandate without exchequer financial assistance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1541">Transport 21 provides for the development of a Luas line from St. Stephen's Green to Liffey Junction (Lines BX and D), using the old Broadstone railway alignment.  Luas Line BX runs from St. Stephen's Green to O'Connell Street, while Luas Line D is the onward extension of the line from O'Connell Street to Liffey Junction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">I mandated the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA), earlier this year, to proceed with planning the delivery of Line BX/D, based on the Agency's preferred route for Line BX and the use of the Old Broadstone railway alignment for Line D.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">The RPA is now progressing with detailed planning to implement this decision.  In addition, the RPA is engaging with Dublin City Council on the basis that it is its intention to make a single railway order application for the combined Line BX/D to An Bord Pleanala in the latter part of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">It will not be possible to fully construct Luas Line BX at the same time as construction of Metro North because of the traffic management implications which would arise in the city centre.  The RPA is developing a construction strategy for Luas Line BX/D, in close co-operation with Dublin City Council, which includes use of Metro North construction sites and recognises the traffic management requirements of the city centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">I understand from the RPA that public consultation on Line D route options will commence this Summer, with the identification of a preferred route option likely before the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">The timescale for the project will be dependant on the outcome of the construction strategy being developed between the RPA, the City Council and other stakeholders in the city centre.  It will also depend on the outcome of the railway order process with An Bord Pleanála.</p>

            <p eId="para_1562">A number of Transport 21 projects are planned for the period up to 2015, which will have a major impact on Dublin city centre.  These include Metro North, DART Interconnector and Luas Line BX/D.  Pending the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, the Dublin City Manager chairs the Dublin Transport 21 Implementation Group which co-ordinates and oversees the investment programme in Dublin.  The group comprises the chief executives of the principal implementing agencies, an Assistant Secretary from my Department, the Fingal County Manager, the Director of Traffic and representatives of the Garda Síochána and business associations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">Two sub-groups have been established and the business community are represented on both.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">The Contingency Planning Group will oversee the preparation of a traffic management plan for the Transport 21 construction phase, focused particularly on the city centre.  This plan will also take account of other construction activity by local authorities, public bodies and private developers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">The Communications Group will prepare and oversee a co-ordinated communications strategy for the construction period of major Transport 21 projects, such as Metro North and the Interconnector.  The theme of this strategy will be Dublin is open for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">In addition, in March this year I held a meeting with the Transport 21 implementing agencies, An Garda Síochána and business organisations in Dublin to identify the principal concerns of the business community and to review progress on traffic planning for the construction phase.  I intend that this will be the first in a regular series of meetings over the coming years to review progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">The provision and financing of a bridge at Macken Street is primarily a matter for Dublin City Council.

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_501">
            <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1569">The Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) was established on 5 June 2002.   The MCIB reports of their investigations, which include fishing vessels, leisure related activities and passenger vessel incidents currently contain in the region of 400 recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">The majority of these recommendations, by incident category, have been implemented with the position for each being as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">Fishing Vessels</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">In relation to fishing vessels a safety regime is now in place for all three categories of fishing vessels.  The Fishing Vessel (Safety Provisions) Regulations 2002 was introduced for all fishing vessels over 24 metres in length, in August 2002.  A Safety Code of Practice was introduced in 2004 for fishing vessels less than 15 metres in length.  The Merchant Shipping (Fishing Vessel) (15-24 metres) Regulations came into effect for new vessels on 1 October 2007.  The application of the latter Regulations for 15-24 metres fishing vessels takes effect over a 3-year period depending on the date of build of the fishing vessel.  This represents a phased approach aimed at improving safety measures across all categories of fishing vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">Leisure-related activities</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">For the leisure sector new measures have centred on lifejackets, licensing requirements, enforcement and increased safety awareness.  New regulations in relation to the wearing of lifejackets were introduced in June 2004.  The Regulations contain national requirements governing all types of pleasure craft relating to the carrying and wearing of lifejackets, age restrictions on the operation of pleasure craft including personal watercraft and controls on the use of alcohol and drugs while operating such craft.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">It is now compulsory for all children up to the age of 16 years to wear a life jacket/personal flotation device (PFD) while on board a pleasure craft and for everyone on board small pleasure craft, under 7 metres, to wear a lifejacket/PFD.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">Jet skis</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">Section 6 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005 was introduced to provide that bye-laws may be made regulating or controlling the operation of specified craft, including jet skis, by local authorities, harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland in waters under their control or management or in their functional area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">Passenger Safety</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">All passenger boats are required to have a licence with effect from 1st January 2003 and passenger boat manning regulations came into force from 1st April 2006.  The latter regulations introduced competency requirements for masters of passenger boats.  There has been a crackdown on non-compliance by passenger boat safety involving a campaign of random spot checks over the last number of summers.  Closer liaison with the Garda Síochána and an active policy of prosecution for offenders is also being pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">As outlined the MCIB recommendations have made a significant contribution to the development of a range of maritime safety measures.  The measures cover safety at sea for all those who venture on to the water, most particularly for those seafarers and others who earn their living from domestic waters, whether by coastal trade or fishing or when engaging in various leisure activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">There is now an ongoing safety awareness programme being promoted by the Irish Coast Guard and Maritime Administration.  The campaign involves amongst other things, a series of radio and on-line safety awareness advertisements and intensified targeted publicity campaigns over the summer months.  Where measures have yet to be implemented they continue to provide an input into the ongoing development of the maritime safety agenda and are being considered by my Department in the overall context of delivering maritime safety.</p>

            <p eId="para_1585">Consumer protection legislation falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">I have been informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, that the Consumer Cooperation Network (CCN), whose membership is made up of the consumer enforcement bodies in the various member states, carried out its first joint market surveillance/enforcement exercise in the form of an internet inquiry (a "sweep") on air tickets selling websites in September 2007 under the coordination of the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">I have been advised that the National Consumer Agency (NCA) were unable to participate in the Commission sweep of the airline sector in late September as they had committed to another international sweep — an International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN) sweep, the very same week in relation to internet selling. In any case, many of the areas covered by the Sweep were already under examination by the NCA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">I understand that the NCA have pursued a number of issues with three Irish Airlines and while some improvement has been made, the response of the airlines are being assessed by the NCA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">In addition discussions on a new European Regulation, consolidating and updating existing legislation governing, inter-alia, the setting of fares and rates for air services in the Community are nearing finalisation.  Since the market for air services was liberalised in the early 1990's carriers have been free to set their own fares.  One of the key new elements likely to be introduced in the new Regulation is an obligation on carriers to make pricing information more transparent.  It is expected that this Regulation will be adopted in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1596">In line with the efficiency review of administrative expenditure announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech last December, my Department has sent a report to the Department of Finance with specific proposals to achieve administrative savings in both the Department and a number of its non-commercial and regulatory agencies. In the case of the agencies, these reviews were carried out internally by each agency's management. My understanding is that the Department of Finance will consider this report and bring proposals to Government in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">My Department's report to the Department of Finance was accompanied by a review by senior Departmental management of the structure of the economic regulation, safety regulation and accident investigation bodies under the aegis of my Department; in this regard, a range of options are still under consideration in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1647">A suggested National Cycling Policy was received with the research into best international practice.  However, as there is a close inter-relationship between the development of a National Cycling Policy and delivery of STTAP, detailed policy consideration must be undertaken of the research output to ensure that it will ultimately be a good fit with STTAP.</p>

         the position regarding the process of mutual recognition of penalty points across the EU; the plans he has to reform the National Vehicle Driver File to record all motoring offences committed on roads here whether by drivers with Irish or foreign licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1650">There is no process for the mutual recognition of penalty points across the EU at present.  While we are currently working with the United Kingdom with the objective of having a bilateral agreement on mutual recognition of driving disqualifications in place later this year, the mutual recognition of penalty points between our jurisdictions is a much more difficult matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">Such recognition involves complex legal questions, which have yet to be determined and which will require the passage of primary legislation both here and in the United Kingdom in due course.  While both jurisdictions are working on this, it will be a number of years before a bilateral agreement can be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1652">The National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) constitutes the records for the holders of Irish driving licences and Irish registered vehicles.  In addition to records of offences committed by Irish drivers the NVDF also contains details of penalty points instances by the holders of foreign licences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653">Arrangements for the recording of all motoring offences committed by foreign licence holders must await completion of bilateral arrangements on the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications and thereby facilitate the 'homing' of data in the jurisdiction of the licence holder.  The NVDF system will be adjusted to facilitate such arrangements at the appropriate time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1671">Responsibility for driver licensing and testing was transferred to the Road Safety Authority in September 2006, under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006).  The arrangements in relation to driver testing and licensing, including the provision of information on the numbers of candidates for driving tests, tests conducted, test pass and fail rates, licence holders, are therefore a matter for the Road Safety Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">The regulations introducing changes to driver licensing including the removal of the concession whereby a holder of a second provisional licence may drive unaccompanied were made in October 2007.  I confirm that, with effect from 30 June 2008, all holders of provisional licences or learner permits must be accompanied by a person who holds a full driving licence for at least two years.  I have not received any submission from stakeholders or transport groups seeking to have the implementation date for this requirement extended beyond 30 June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">Following on the changes to the driver licensing laws for learner drivers in October 2007, both I and the Road Safety Authority confirmed that all 122,000 applicants on the waiting list at the end of October 2007 would be tested by March 2008 and that by the end of June 2008 all applicants for a driving test would be able to get a test on demand, that is within a 10 week period.  The commitment for March 2008 was met and the Road Safety Authority is confident that the second commitment will also be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_1702">Since 2006, 18 Statutory Instruments relating to the work of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) have been produced.  These Statutory Instruments specify technical requirements such as the contents and scope of statistical surveys and do not alter the regulatory framework.  As RIA is only required in the case of significant SIs involving changes to the regulatory environment, it was not applicable in these cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1716">Social partnership is a responsive and continually evolving process, an important aspect of which is ensuring wide and appropriate involvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">All applications for social partner status are considered in that context and against long-established criteria, i.e. that the organisations:</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">must be national and representative in nature;</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">have the capacity to meet the demands and obligations that arise as part of this participation; and</p>

            <p eId="para_1721">Organisations are also required to accept the terms of the relevant partnership agreement and the agreed participation structures for its implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">Shortly after the conclusion of negotiations for Towards 2016, my Department received a letter from the Consumers Association requesting social partnership status for the Association.  The application was considered in the context of the criteria outlined above and the Government decided not to admit the Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">It is considered that the National Consumer Agency provides the appropriate mechanism for the consumer perspective to be channelled into the partnership process via the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">Towards 2016 recognises the importance of competition and providing a fair deal for consumers.  In this regard, the NCA has a strong mandate in terms of consumer advocacy, research, information, enforcement, education and awareness, and is empowered and resourced to promote the consumers' case with regulated industries and individual regulators.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">In addition, the view and experiences of the Association and other consumer groups will of course continue to be taken into account by Departments and Agencies in the normal consultative process.</p>

The classification system being used is the Irish Crime Classification System (ICCS), first introduced by the CSO in April 2008, full details of which can be found at www.cso.ie.

            <p eId="para_3996">Total Expenditure on advertising by the Central Statistics Office in the years from 2005 to 2007 amounted to just under €1.765 million.  The annual distribution of this expenditure and the advertising medium used is set out in the tables beneath.</p>
            <p eId="para_3997">The vast bulk of this expenditure — over 95% — relates to two statistical activities, the 2006 Census of Population and the Household Surveys i.e. cyclical Household Budget Survey and the Quarterly National Household Survey.</p>
            <p eId="para_3998">The 2006 Census of Population public awareness and staff recruitment campaigns cost €1.55 million.  The Census involved the recruitment of approximately 5,000 field and temporary HQ staff and a public awareness campaign designed to promote the active participation of all people resident in the State on Census night.</p>
            <p eId="para_3999">The Quarterly National Household Survey, introduced in 1997, provides estimates of employment and unemployment within three months of the end of each quarter.  It has also become a key source of statistics on social topics, with the incorporation of different modular topics.</p>
            <p eId="para_4000">It is an on-going survey with respondents being added and removed on a rolling cyclical basis.  Respondents participate in the survey for 5 quarters.  Each quarter, a percentage of the respondents are replaced by new participants.  The survey is conducted by the CSO's permanent field staff and focussed local advertising is used to ensure that respondents, in particular new respondents, are aware that an official survey is taking place in their area and the statistical benefits of participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4001">The remaining expenditure on advertising relates to a variety of items, the main one being the annual cost of the State Directory — "the green pages" section in telephone directories.  Expenditure on advertising to the end of May 2008 amounted to just under €26,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_4002">A little over €11,000 of this was spent on recruitment advertising and the remainder related to Quarterly National Household Survey awareness advertising.</p>
            <p eId="para_4003">There are no significant advertising/PR programmes currently under way or planned by the Central Statistics Office. Any further expenditure on advertising in 2008 will relate to general advertising of CSO publications and services and will probably be in the order of €25,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_4058">The Consumer Credit Act 1995, regulates the provision of consumer credit in Ireland.  Section 30 of the Act requires credit agreements to be made in writing and signed by the consumer and by or on behalf of all other parties to the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4059">Section 11(<i>d</i>) of the Electronic Commerce Act 2000, states the nothing in that Act shall prejudice the operation of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, thus exempting the conclusion of credit agreements from the scope of the Electronic Commerce Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_4060">The recently-adopted Directive on credit agreements for consumers, (2008/48/EC), lays down harmonised rules for aspects of the provision of consumer credit in EU Member States, including information to be included in advertising and in pre-contractual and contractual documentation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4061">The Directive provides that pre-contractual information, credit agreements, statements of account and notice of withdrawal or termination may be drawn up on paper or on another durable medium.  Durable medium is defined in the Directive as "any instrument which enables the consumer to store information addressed personally to him in a way accessible for future reference for a period of time adequate for the purposes of the information and which allows the unchanged reproduction of the information stored".</p>
            <p eId="para_4062">Transposition of the Directive into Irish legislation will require substantial amendments to the Consumer Credit Act 1995, including to those provisions relating to the conclusion of credit agreements in writing.  Consequent amendments to the Electronic Commerce Act 2000, may also be necessary and I will consider this matter further in the context of the transposition process in consultation with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and with the Financial Regulator, in view of its statutory consumer protection role.  The Directive is to be transposed not later than 12 May 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_4064">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in so far as both vehicle registration tax (VRT) and VAT are concerned, the same rates of VRT and VAT (where VAT is chargeable on used vehicles) are applied to both new vehicles and imported used vehicles.  Accordingly, Ireland is fully compliant with EU regulations relating to VAT and VRT payable on the registration of vehicles in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4065">VRT is currently based on engine size and is charged on the open market selling price (OMSP) of the vehicle in the State.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that from 1 July 2008, the registration of category A vehicles (passenger vehicles) will be based on the level of CO2 emissions for a vehicle.</p>
            <p eId="para_4066">OMSP is defined in Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 and is the price inclusive of all taxes and duties which a vehicle may reasonably be expected to fetch on a first arm's length sale in the open market in the State by retail.  The OMSP of new vehicles in the State is declared to the Revenue Commissioners by a wholesale distributor, while the OMSP of imported second hand vehicles is determined by the Revenue Commissioners based on factors such as age, mileage and vehicle condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_4067">In order to provide the same tax base for the application of the tax on the registration of vehicles sourced both in the State and abroad, VRT is charged on the OMSP of the vehicle and not on the purchase price of vehicles bought in other jurisdictions.  EU Member States are entitled under EU law to charge National taxes provided that such taxes are applied equally to imported and indigenous goods.  In this regard, VRT complies with EU law in that the VRT charged on a vehicle imported into the State is equivalent to the amount of residual VRT contained in a similar Irish vehicle that is registered in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4068">In so far as VAT is concerned, Irish VAT law — the Value-Added Tax Act 1972, as amended — must and does comply with the underlying EU VAT law, principally Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value-added tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_4069">As regards vehicles brought into the State by private citizens the VAT treatment depends on whether the vehicle is new or used and on whether it is brought in from another EU Member State or a third country.  For this purpose, a vehicle is "new" if it is supplied six months or less after its first entry into service or if it has travelled 6,000 kilometres or less.  The Deputy may wish to note that a used vehicle brought in to the State by a private citizen from another EU Member State is not subject to VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_4070">In the case of new or used motor vehicles imported by private citizens from outside the EU, VAT is charged at the standard rate of 21 per cent and is based on the price of the vehicle, plus the costs of carriage, freight and insurance, and the Customs duties charged.  Where a private citizen brings in a new vehicle from another EU Member State, VAT is charged at the standard rate of 21 per cent and the value for calculating the VAT payable is the amount invoiced in the Member State of acquisition (converted to Euro where applicable).  Other Member State's VAT shown as being included in such invoiced amounts is not included in the taxable amount for Irish VAT purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_4085">All of County Longford is a qualifying area for the purposes of the Rural Renewal Scheme. This scheme was  introduced in 1998 and is due to terminate on 31/07/08.</p>
            <p eId="para_4086">Two different tax reliefs are available under the scheme in respect of qualifying residential units. These are:</p>
            <p eId="para_4087">Owner occupier relief; and</p>
            <p eId="para_4088">Rented residential relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_4089">Owner-Occupier Relief</p>
            <p eId="para_4090">An individual who incurs expenditure on the construction, refurbishment, conversion or purchase of his/her house which is a qualifying house, is entitled to an additional tax free allowance as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_4091">5% per annum of the expenditure for 10 years in respect of new construction;</p>
            <p eId="para_4092">10% per annum of the expenditure for 10 years in respect of refurbishment or conversion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4093">Relief is granted at the individual's highest rate of tax. It can be given either by increasing an individual's tax-free allowance during the year or by repayment of tax at the end of the year. Where the individual is self-employed the tax relief will be given in the annual tax assessment. If the property is sold within the 10 year writing down period any relief granted is not withdrawn but a subsequent purchaser is not entitled to the relief. The cost of the site does not qualify for relief and grants are deducted in arriving at the amount of expenditure that qualifies for relief. Only the cost of work actually carried out during the "qualifying period" can qualify for relief under the scheme. Where a property is purchased from a builder the expenditure that qualifies for relief is the proportion of the   purchase price that relates to the construction expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_4094">To qualify, the property must be:</p>
            <p eId="para_4095">not less  than 38 sq. metres and not greater than 210 sq. metres in floor area;</p>
            <p eId="para_4096">situated within a qualifying rural area and be a qualifying building;</p>
            <p eId="para_4097">occupied by the individual after the expenditure is incurred as his/her sole or main residence;</p>
            <p eId="para_4098">occupied by the individual as his/her sole or main residence for each year of claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_4099">Rented Residential Relief</p>
            <p eId="para_4100">This relief is available to individuals and companies for 100% of the cost of constructing, refurbishing and converting rented residential property (exclusive of site costs and grants as appropriate). These costs can be deducted in full or in part from rental income arising in the State.  The amount of the expenditure that qualifies for relief is deducted in full from the rental income from the property. If this deduction exceeds the rental income in the first year from the property, the excess can be deducted from other rental income arising in the State for that year. Any rental loss created in the first year can be carried forward against rental income of succeeding years until the relief is exhausted.  If the property is sold within a period of 10 years of its first letting any relief granted is withdrawn. A subsequent purchaser of the property within the 10 year period is entitled to the relief provided the property is available for full time letting for the remainder of the 10 year period. Where a property is purchased from a builder, the expenditure that qualifies for relief is the proportion of the purchase price that relates to the construction expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_4101">To qualify, the property must be:</p>
            <p eId="para_4102">not less than 38 sq. metres and not greater than 175 sq. metres in floor area.  In respect of eligible expenditure incurred prior to 6 December 2000 the maximum floor area is 140 square metres in respect of a newly constructed house or apartment and 150 square metres where a house or apartment has been refurbished or converted from non residential to residential use;</p>
            <p eId="para_4103">situated within a qualifying rural area and be a qualifying building;</p>
            <p eId="para_4104">let under a qualifying lease for a term of at least 3 months after the expenditure is incurred without being otherwise used;</p>
            <p eId="para_4105">continue to be let for terms of at least 3 months during a period of 10 years from the date of first letting, except for reasonable periods of temporary disuse between the ending of one lease and the commencement of another lease.</p>
            <p eId="para_4106">Scheme Qualifying Period</p>
            <p eId="para_4107">To qualify for relief the work must be carried out during the "qualifying period". The qualifying period for the 2 reliefs is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_4108">Rented Residential Relief — 1 June 1998 to 31 July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4109">Owner-Occupier Relief — 6 April 1999 to 31 July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4110">The scheme was originally due to terminate on 31 December 2002 and was extended by 2 years from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2004 in the 2002 Finance Act. The 31 December 2004 deadline was further extended in Finance Act 2004 until 31 July 2006 where an application for full planning permission was received by the planning authority by 31 December 2004. Where the work involved is exempted development for the purposes of the Planning and Development Act 2000 the extension to 31 July 2006 also applies where the following conditions were met by 31 December 2004:</p>
            <p eId="para_4111">a detailed plan in relation to the development work was prepared,</p>
            <p eId="para_4112">a binding contract in writing exists under which the expenditure was incurred,</p>
            <p eId="para_4113">and work to the value of 5 per cent of the development costs was carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_4114">The  31 July 2006 termination date was further extended in Finance Act 2006 to 31 July 2008 where work to the value of 15% of the actual construction or refurbishment costs was carried out on or before 31 December 2006. While local authority certification is not required, the person claiming relief must be able to show that this condition has been met.  There is a gradual reduction in the amount of expenditure qualifying for relief after 31 December 2006. Expenditure incurred during 2006 can qualify in full without restriction. However, only 75% of expenditure incurred in 2007 and 50% of expenditure incurred in the period between 1 January 2008 to 31 July 2008 can qualify for relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_4115">Certification Requirements</p>
            <p eId="para_4116">Qualifying construction, refurbishment and conversion expenditure under the scheme must be certified by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This certification involves the issue of a Certificate of Compliance or a Certificate of Reasonable Cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_4117">A Certificate of Compliance is required where a newly constructed, refurbished or converted property is purchased from a builder. While a Certificate of Reasonable Cost is required where a newly constructed, newly converted or newly refurbished property is to be lived in or let by the person who carried out the work or who had it carried out. These certify that the property in question complies with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's standards of construction, is within the specified floor area limits and in the case of refurbishment projects that the work was necessary to ensure the suitability as a dwelling of the property.</p>
            <p eId="para_4118">Mortgage Interest Relief</p>
            <p eId="para_4119">In the case of investors, interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair a qualifying house can be deducted for tax purposes from the rental income received from a qualifying residential property.  In the case of owner occupiers, tax relief at the standard rate is available in respect qualifying interest on a qualifying loan in respect of a qualifying residence.  The ceiling for mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers was increased in Budget 2008 from €8,000 single/€16,000 married to €10,000 single/€20,000 married. The ceiling for non first-time buyers is €3,000 single/€6,000 married.</p>

            <p eId="para_4129">I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 to 175, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4130">These questions relate to transportation issues in the Phoenix Park: Public Buses, New carpark, Traffic Management and White's Gate.</p>
            <p eId="para_4131">As the Deputy is aware, the Phoenix Park Transportation Study, dated September 2006, recommended a number of measures aimed at reducing the significant traffic pressures on the Park and at the same time, enhancing the Visitor experience of the Park. The current position is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4132">Public buses: I wish to confirm that the OPW has agreed to facilitate a limited public transport service through the Park. The details of this service have still to be confirmed by Dublin Bus.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4133">Carpark: A new carpark located off the Lord's walk adjacent to Dublin Zoo, is now open to the public from 10.00 a.m. each morning. It accommodates 260 cars and serves all Park visitors.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4134">Shuttle Bus service: This service commenced on 2nd May 2008 for an initial pilot period of a year with provision for review and extension for a further two years. It will greatly enhance public access to the Park and reduce dependency on the car to access the Park and its many features.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4135">Upper Glen Road: Remedial works were undertaken on a stretch of this road in April 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_4208">Ireland has generous provisions in its tax code for granting relief from double taxation in respect of income of Irish residents that has suffered tax in a foreign country. Generally this allows for foreign tax paid by an Irish resident taxpayer to be credited against the Irish tax on the same income. Normally credit relief is only granted in respect of tax suffered in countries with which Ireland has concluded a double taxation treaty. The relief is granted based on the elimination of double taxation article in the relevant treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_4209">In certain cases Ireland has gone further and provided unilateral credit for foreign tax paid in countries for which there is not a double taxation treaty in place. This is provided for in relation to certain foreign dividends and interest of Irish companies. There are also similar provisions covering foreign branch profits of Irish companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4210">Granting credit unilaterally in respect of income from countries with which Ireland does not have a double taxation treaty in place would have Exchequer implications and this is a matter that would need to be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_4211">More importantly, the granting unilaterally of benefits that are normally only given on a reciprocal basis in double taxation treaties may impact on the priority that non-treaty countries give to requests from Ireland to enter into negotiations for a double taxation treaty.</p>

            <p eId="para_4213">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in the case of privately owned and regional airports attendance by Revenue staff is in the context of control visits where staff are seeking to protect the State against the illegal introduction of restricted goods. These control visits are selective and targeted and based on analysis and evaluation of the ongoing risk at the particular location. Having regard to the nature of these control visits, it is not considered appropriate to seek payment from the operator of the airport and, indeed, there would not appear to be any legal basis for doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_4214">More generally, however, there is provision for Revenue to charge a fee where attendance is requested by an airport operator, for example to facilitate clearance of goods outside of normal hours. In addition, where Revenue grants formal approval to an airport for the arrival and departure of foreign flights, the conditions can include a requirement to provide accommodation and facilities free of charge to the State; this would normally arise where there is a need to have an ongoing presence at an airport because of the volume of traffic.</p>

            <p eId="para_4245">The regulations referred to are the "Return of Payments (Banks, Building Societies, Credit Unions and Savings Banks) Regulations 2008" which give partial effect to the provisions of section 891B (inserted by section 125 of the Finance Act 2006) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which section allows the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations with the consent of the Minister for Finance requiring financial institutions, assurance companies, collective funds and State bodies to make an annual return of customers resident in the State to whom interest or other payments are made.</p>
            <p eId="para_4246">These particular regulations provide for the reporting by banks, building societies, credit unions and the Post Office Savings Bank of interest and other payments made to customers in the year 2004 and each subsequent year where the payment made in respect of an account exceeds €635.</p>
            <p eId="para_4247">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the disclosure initiative recently announced by them relates to holders of large accounts who have undeclared tax liabilities. Specifically, the initiative relates to taxpayers who held in aggregate €100,000 or more in interest bearing accounts at any time in 2005, 2006 or 2007 and who have undeclared tax liabilities associated with the funds in these accounts. These taxpayers now have the opportunity of coming forward voluntarily, and paying their outstanding liabilities and provided they meet the conditions laid down, will pay reduced penalties, will not be published in the quarterly lists in Iris Oifigiúil or face prosecution. Revenue have published a series of FAQs which will be of assistance to taxpayers and they may be accessed on their website www.revenue.ie.  Revenue is also operating a helpline (01-6474818) that taxpayers can contact if they have any questions on the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_4248">Revenue has emphasised, and I would like to repeat, that the initiative is focused on large deposit accounts and will affect a relatively small number of tax evaders: the vast majority of taxpayers have no need to worry.</p>
            <p eId="para_4249">Taxpayers who have accounts holding €100,000 or more, where the funds originate from savings from after tax income; tax free retirement lump sums; or the proceeds of the sale of their principal private residence, for example, are not required to make a disclosure under this initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_4250">Additionally, there is absolutely no necessity for any person to withdraw funds from any financial institution and I would strongly advise against this course of action.</p>

            <p eId="para_4253">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that when a person takes an inheritance on the death of another person, the tax-free Group threshold figure applying to that inheritance is the tax-free Group threshold figure applicable as at the date of death of the deceased person and not that applicable as at the date of the completion of the probate of the estate.</p>
            <p eId="para_4254">In this case, as the deceased person died in 2007, the tax-free Group threshold figure that applies to the inheritance taken by the deceased's brother is the 2007 tax-free Group threshold figure of €49,682.</p>
            <p eId="para_4255">Apart from the tax-free Group threshold figure available to a beneficiary, the Capital Acquisitions Tax code (Gift and Inheritance Tax) exempts certain gifts and inheritances completely from tax and also contains relieving provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4256">For example, an inheritance of a dwelling house is exempt from inheritance tax in certain circumstances. If a beneficiary receives an inheritance of a dwelling house, the inheritance of that house will be exempt from inheritance tax if the beneficiary has resided in the house for a minimum of 3 years prior to the inheritance and if the beneficiary has no interest in any other dwelling house. The 3-year residency requirement is a minimum requirement for the exemption to apply.  This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be subject of any tax when it is the subject of an inheritance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4257">A beneficiary in an estate is required to make a self-assessment tax return where benefits of at least 80% of the tax-free threshold figure are received. The return must be filed and the tax liability paid within 4 months of the valuation date of the inheritance to avoid interest charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_4258">In normal circumstances, the valuation date of an inheritance is the date the probate to the estate is extracted and, accordingly, the beneficiary would have 4 months from that date to file the return and pay any tax due.</p>
            <p eId="para_4259">The legislation provides for payment of the tax by 5 equal yearly instalments and also provides for situations of hardship or illiquidity where such instances may be dealt with by postponement of payment in certain cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_4260">The beneficiary of the dwelling house should contact their particular Revenue Region dealing with the matter and set out the circumstances fully with regard to payment of the tax whereupon the position will be fully considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_4262">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where rents are paid directly to a person who is resident outside the State, the tenant is obliged to deduct income tax at the standard rate of 20% from the rental payment and to give the landlord a certificate of the tax deducted. Direct payments include a situation where rent is paid into a bank account in the name of the non-resident landlord. The tenant is then required to make a return and pay to Revenue the tax that he or she has deducted from the rent. The landlord is entitled to a credit for the tax deducted by the tenant against his or her final rental income tax liability and is obliged to pay any additional tax that may be due.</p>
            <p eId="para_4263">The tenant is not responsible for discharging the landlord's liability to tax on rental income. Instead, the withholding of tax on rental income by tenants of non-resident landlords is primarily a control measure. It is designed to promote greater compliance in this area having regard to the obvious risk factors associated with non-resident taxpayers. Where it applies, it provides in a very direct manner, valuable information for Revenue which might otherwise be difficult to obtain.</p>
            <p eId="para_4264">Where rent is paid to an Irish agent of a non-resident landlord, such as an Irish-based estate agent acting on behalf of the non-resident landlord, the tenant is not required to deduct income tax from the rent payable. In such cases, the non-resident landlord is chargeable to tax in the name of the Irish agent.</p>
            <p eId="para_4265">In the case of residential lettings, tenants may not be aware of their obligation to deduct tax. This can occur either because the tenants are unaware that the landlord is resident abroad or because the tenants are unaware of the obligation to deduct tax when making payment to such a landlord.  Where a tenant claims not to have been aware of the obligation to deduct tax, the matter should be referred to the Regional Director before any assessment is made on the tenant. The tenant should be asked to provide the following details as regards the landlord:</p>
            <p eId="para_4266">Name and address;</p>
            <p eId="para_4267">Details of the bank account into which rent is paid (name and address of the bank and the account number into which the payments are made);</p>
            <p eId="para_4268">Details of the rents paid to the non-resident landlord for all years for which the landlord was resident abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_4269">An assessment can be entered on the landlord, at his or her foreign address, and where necessary powers of attachment under section 1002 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 can be used to enforce collection of the tax due. The tenant should be advised to deduct tax from all future payments to the landlord.</p>
            <p eId="para_4270">Where a claim for rent allowance is received in respect of rent and there are indications that the landlord is resident abroad, the tenant should be advised of the obligation to deduct tax from payments direct to the landlord, including payments into a bank account of the landlord. Where the tenant claims to have been unaware of the obligation to deduct tax, any allowance for rent paid by the tenant need not be restricted where the tenant has provided the information relating to the landlord, mentioned above. The question of assessing the tenant in respect of tax which should have been deducted from rents should be referred to the Regional Director.</p>
            <p eId="para_4271">I am advised that the policies and procedures relating to the deduction of tax on rent payable to non-residents have been set out in the Revenue publication "Tax Briefing 42" and that these policies and procedures are being kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_4297">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that since April 2007, individuals are exempt from DIRT on their savings income provided they or their spouse are aged 65 or over and their total income in a year (including the savings income) is below the annual exemption limit — currently €20,000 in the case of a single person and €40,000 in the case of a married couple. These exemption limits are increased where the individual has one or more dependent children.</p>
            <p eId="para_4298">In order to claim the exemption, the person must make a declaration (on Form DE 1) to the financial institution where the account is held, to the effect that either they or their spouse are aged 65 years or over during the year, and that their total annual income does not exceed the exemption limit. Where a person makes such a declaration, the financial institution will pay any interest accruing on the relevant account without deduction of DIRT. Should the individual's circumstances change following the submission of this declaration form, they are required to notify the financial institution to that effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_4299">Where a person's income marginally exceeds the relevant exemption limit, he or she will not be entitled to the exemption but may be entitled to a partial refund of the tax deducted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4300">Prior to April 2007, there was no direct exemption from DIRT on savings income beneficially owned by persons aged 65 and over. However, in cases where the individual or his/her spouse was aged 65 or over and their income was less than the exemption limit, he or she could apply to Revenue for a refund of the DIRT they had paid.</p>

         the amount refunded in 2006 and 2007 by the Revenue Commissioners in overpaid income tax as a result of the failure of employers to recognise the exemption from income tax liability of maternity benefit; the number of taxpayers repaid; the corresponding figures to date in 2008; the steps being taken to ensure that employers comply with this exemption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4336">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested (regarding the amount refunded in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in overpaid income tax and the associated number of taxpayers repaid as a result of the failure of employers to recognise the exemption from income tax liability of maternity benefit) cannot be provided. This is because the PAYE system does not identify the reason giving rise to a review of an individual's tax liability, rather it is the outcome of the review that is recorded — for example, whether an overpayment or underpayment of tax arises or whether an additional tax credit or allowance should be granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4337">I am further informed that payroll arrangements in operation while an employee is on maternity leave and in receipt of maternity benefit may vary depending on particular circumstances and different contracts of employment. Revenue has given guidance to employers (in Chapter 7 of the Employer's Guide to PAYE) on the different payment/recovery scenarios involved, including where the employer recovers maternity benefit and continues to pay wages, and the appropriate PAYE treatment in each set of circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4338">Revenue became aware last year that some employers have been treating maternity benefit incorrectly for taxation purposes. Revenue wrote to the employers concerned (as well as to others that may have been in the same situation): (a) reminding them of the correct PAYE treatment; and (b) requesting details of any employees affected for the years 2003 to 2007 (the years for which, at that stage, a rebate claim was still in time in accordance with section 865 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997).</p>
            <p eId="para_4339">The replies received in response to this initiative are now being examined but further work (including contact with some of the employers) will be needed before any overall picture emerges.</p>

            <p eId="para_4341">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a Form P45 is required, under PAYE regulations, to be given by an employer to an employee on cessation of employment. This form certifies the employee's pay, tax and PRSI contributions from the start of the tax year to the date of cessation and also certifies that the deductions have been made in accordance with the instructions given by Revenue. If an employee does not get a form P45 when leaving, he/she should ask the employer for one and repeat the request if necessary. If the employer still fails to give the P45, the employee should notify his/her local Revenue Office in writing that he/she has failed, after several attempts, to get a P45 and the matter will be followed up by Revenue with the employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4342">I understand that most such cases are resolved quickly following intervention by Revenue.  However, if the problem persists the employer may be subject to civil penalties (under section 987 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) for breach of the PAYE regulations, or may be charged with a "Revenue offence" (under section 1078 of the same Act), for failing, without reasonable excuse, to issue a required certificate or notification.</p>

            <p eId="para_4347">The NDP (2007-2013) launched by the Government in January 2007 provided for the establishment of a Central Monitoring Committee (the CMC) to monitor implementation of the NDP.  The CMC consists of the Social Partners, regional interests, environmental interests and those Government Departments involved in the implementation of the NDP.  The NDP also provided that an annual report on NDP implementation would be prepared for submission to the Oireachtas where it would be subject to debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_4348">The NDP also indicated that the CMC would assess NDP progress by reference to a Report prepared by the Department of Finance.  The CMC considered a report on NDP progress in 2007 at its most recent meeting in Athlone on May 16th last.  This Report was based on a reporting template for NDP Sub-Programmes which included financial inputs, Sub-Programme outputs, impact indicators and the contribution as relevant of Sub-Programmes to promoting all-island co-operation, regional development, environmental sustainability and the development of the rural economy.  The detailed Sub-Programme reports were made available to the CMC, as indeed they have been to Oireachtas Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_4349">Following on from the consideration by the CMC, the Department of Finance has prepared a draft 2007 NDP Report which, after consideration by the Government, will be laid before the Oireachtas.  I expect this to happen in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_4351">The following document details the schedule of leased and owned office space in Galway City. In the matter of leased space the annual cost per lease incurred by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the occupying clients is included. It should be noted that all leases scheduled in the document were ‘active' throughout 2007, and therefore the expenditure for that year was €3.2m approx.</p>

Consequently, the precise figures of net yield of tax revenues from the construction industry cannot be readily identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_4521">Information in relation to VAT, Income Tax and Corporation Tax can, however, be provided for the year 2004 as to the estimated gross amounts of taxes paid (i.e. before allowing for repayments) by taxpayers in the construction industry. In considering these data, it is important to bear in mind the specific assumptions that have been made and are set out in the notes below. Also, it is important to bear in mind that the figures provided are estimates. The figures given below for 2004 are identical to those supplied in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 146.</p>
            <p eId="para_4522">The gross yield of VAT (not including VAT on imports), PAYE/PRSI, Income tax non-PAYE and Corporation tax from taxpayers in the construction industry within the tax head is estimated as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_4537">These figures are gross receipts as provided by the Revenue Commissioners and differ slightly from the Exchequer receipts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4538">"Income Tax (non-PAYE)" includes direct Income Tax and PRSI payments received from self-assessed taxpayers and the estimated Relevant Contracts Tax not offset to other taxes, attributable to the construction industry but excludes certain "deduction" taxes such as Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Withholding Tax on professional fees, Dividend Withholding Tax as well as yields from audit and other back duty settlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4539">The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4 digit "NACE code (Rev. 1)" which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system.  The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources. While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_4540">The figure provided for the estimated gross yield from the construction industry has been expanded to include the yield from activities and businesses which are related, either in whole or in part, to the construction sector.  An example of these would be architecture, engineering and the manufacture of products used in construction, but not real estate activities.</p>

         the criteria used for deciding whether non-PAYE income would cause a person to be regarded as self-assessed and therefore not eligible for designating tax relief on charitable donations to the charity and no longer eligible to use the Revenue Commissioners’ on-line PAYE service; and his views on relaxing these criteria.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4549">The Finance Act 2005 amended the definition of "chargeable person" for tax purposes and subsequently the Revenue Commissioners published the criteria used by them for deciding whether a person is to be regarded as subject to the rules of the self assessed system of taxation. These criteria were set out in Tax Briefing 62 dated December 2005 which is available from the Revenue website www.revenue.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_4550">In summary, the position is that an individual with PAYE income is not<b> </b>regarded as a chargeable person where:</p>
            <p eId="para_4551">he/she has less than €50,000 gross income from non-PAYE sources (excluding social welfare payments),</p>
            <p eId="para_4552">the net assessable non-PAYE income, i.e. income after deductions, allowances and reliefs, is less than €3,174, and</p>
            <p eId="para_4553">the income is coded in his/her tax credit certificate against PAYE income, thereby enabling the person's complete income tax position to be managed within the PAYE system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4554">Where these criteria are not met, the person is a "chargeable person" and must make a tax return under the self-assessment system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4555">It is important to point out that self-assessed taxpayers are not prevented from availing of tax relief on charitable donations — they simply avail of the relief in a different manner — i.e. by taking a deduction on their tax return of the qualifying amount, which must be more than €250.  Similarly, while chargeable persons may not use Revenue's PAYE Online Service, they may, of course, use the Revenue Online Service (ROS) for self-assessed taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4556">The different approaches are due to the inherent differences in the way employment income and other income is taxed.  All income is reportable to Revenue, but the criteria are designed so as to enable PAYE taxpayers who have modest non-PAYE income to have their tax managed and paid through the PAYE system, rather than having to meet the filing obligations of self-assessment.  The criteria seem to me to strike a reasonable balance in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_4592">I propose to take Questions Nos. 214, 221 and 222 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4593">The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed inter alia for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, who is the deciding authority, refused such requests.</p>
            <p eId="para_4594">The Finance Act 2008, as the Deputies are aware, consequently provided the legislative changes to withdraw the relief in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles.  The relief will be withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2008 and the appropriate full excise rates will apply from that date.  In the circumstances outlined above the question of reconsidering or deferring the withdrawal of the existing relief does not therefore arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_4595">The Department of Transport and other relevant line Departments have, in conjunction with my Department, explored alternative mechanisms that might be used to direct Exchequer resources toward such services from that date, subject of course to compatibility with competition and EU State Aid requirements.  While the matter is still being considered it is necessary however to stress, despite the claims being made otherwise, that introducing an alternative suitable mechanism is not a straightforward matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_4607">In terms of Government spending, the end-May Exchequer returns showed that expenditure was broadly on target for the first five months of 2008.  The 2008 spending plans were set out in detail in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2008 which were published on 21 February 2008.  While the fiscal position has weakened from that envisaged at Budget time, this has to be considered in the context of the strong position of the public finances such as our low debt to GDP ratio.</p>
            <p eId="para_4608">The most recent Exchequer returns for the period to end-May showed that there was an Exchequer deficit of €3,598 million.  Taxes were €1,166 million or -6.4% below profile and down 8% on a year-on-year basis.  This shortfall will not be recovered later this year. The weakness in taxes, particularly on VAT, CGT and Stamp Duty receipts, reflect a number of factors namely, the substantial adjustment in the housing market, the ongoing difficulties in the international financial markets and slower domestic economic activity such as weaker retail sales.  The overall prospects for 2008 will be assessed in the context of the Exchequer returns to the next end quarter (end- June) at which stage the usual statement will be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_4636">The Government decision in May 2006 approved the development of a new national forensic mental health facility at Thornton Hall, Co. Dublin.  The new hospital facility will provide a therapeutic, forensic psychiatric service to the highest international standards, in a state-of–the-art building.  The decision to relocate the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) is consistent with "A Vision for Change" — the report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, which recommends that the CMH should be replaced or remodelled to allow it to provide care and treatment in a modern, up-to-date humane setting and that capacity should be maximised.</p>
            <p eId="para_4637">The redevelopment of the CMH will constitute a separate capital development project independent of the prison complex to replace Mountjoy Prison, and will be owned and managed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The new hospital will be built on its own campus and will retain its identity as a distinct therapeutic health facility with a separate entrance and address to the prison complex.  It is not envisaged at this stage that any legislative amendment will be required to facilitate the disposal of the current hospital and the construction of a replacement facility at Thornton Hall.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_4639">The matter referred to relates the eligibility of a child for adoption as contained in Section 10(c) of the Adoption Act, 1952, as amended by Section 2 of the Adoption Act, 1964, and in particular, the possibility of the adoption of a child by a surviving parent and their new spouse.  Section 10(c) as amended provides that, in order to be eligible for adoption, a child must be "illegitimate or an orphan" or be a child who has been legitimated, but whose birth has not been re-registered.  Therefore, under this Act children of marriage are not eligible for adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_4640">The Adoption Act, 1988, does permit the adoption of any child (including children of marriage) but only in exceptional and very limited circumstances where the parents are shown to have completely abandoned their parental duties, and there is an expectation that they will continue to do so until the child reaches the age of eighteen.  After its passage through the Oireachtas, the President referred the Adoption Bill, 1988 to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution, for a decision on whether the provisions of the Bill were repugnant to the Constitution.  While it was found to be Constitutional, and subsequently became the Adoption Act, 1988,  it was clear that these narrow circumstances, based on Article 42.5 of the Constitution, were the basis for the decision of the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_4641">The Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 was published in February 2007 and contained the Government's proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children and included a provision to ensure that all children would be eligible for voluntary adoption, subject to appropriate consents.  The Programme for Government of June 2007 committed to deepening consensus on the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 and to this end, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children [JCCAC] was established in November, 2007, to report back within four months, on the proposals set out in the Bill.  The Committee recently received Dáil and Seanad approval for an extension of their timeframe to 30th November 2008.  The Committee is now progressing with its work and the Government awaits the outcome of its deliberations before proceeding further with the proposed amendment of the Constitution in relation to children.</p>

         her views on the findings in a recent programme on the services for children at risk; and the meetings she has held and the action she has initiated to address the issues raised. 
        [22492/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_591">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_4681">In the first instance I should like to record that the development of robust, responsive and appropriate child welfare and protection services is a priority for both myself, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the Government.  Recent media coverage of this area has facilitated a valuable public debate around these important issues during which voice has been given to a number of legitimate concerns, particularly in the area of service provision.  I would, however also highlight the almost complete non-representation in the media coverage of the many instances of positive outcomes in relation to child welfare and protection issues, which has the potential to present a somewhat one sided view of service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4682">On the day after the broadcast of the Prime Time investigation I met with senior officials from the HSE to discuss, inter alia, the issues raised in that programme.  A key consideration at this meeting was the issue raised in the investigation of waiting lists for services for vulnerable children.  The HSE re-assured me that in all cases where there is a serious and immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child, the HSE responds immediately and takes appropriate action.  All child abuse reports to social work departments are subject to a phased process of initial screening and assessment, aimed at providing appropriate interventions.  In addition, there are also legislative mechanisms in place which also allow for responses from Gardai (for example to take a child to safety in emergency situations relating to welfare and protection).  Regarding the specific queries I raised around the surfeit of accurate and timely data available on the waiting times issues I was informed that a detailed consultation and reporting process was already underway to determine the current state of this issue.  I am informed by the HSE that this exercise is proceeding well and that a report back to me is expected shortly.  In this regard, I should point out that the term waiting list is, in all probability, too generic in this area of provision where 'waiting' means pending a social work allocation to the case on a fulltime basis while the duty teams carry or monitor such cases depending on their assessment of the level of risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_4683">In addition, I have initiated a series of regular meetings on Child Welfare and Protection issues between senior officials of the HSE and my Office at which issues such as service reform and modernisation (including out of hours service provision), as well as any necessary legislative reform will be discussed to drive change and monitor actions for the improvement of child welfare and protection services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4684">As regards the specific issues raised in the recent media coverage around the availability of Social Work provision, particularly out of normal working hours, I am aware that social work out of hours service proposals are currently under consideration by HSE, my own Office and the broader Department of Health and Children.  I would point out that there are currently a number of out of hours service arrangements in operation to partially cover this service around the country, for example in Dublin, dealing with homelessness</p>
            <p eId="para_4685">I should note as well that not all services for children at risk need be provided by social workers.  The HSE provides a multiplicity of services which can effectively address the needs of children at risk.  This includes a range of family support services available in communities as well as Therapy, Medical, Nursing, Psychological, and a very wide range of services benefiting children at all levels of risk.  In addition Non Governmental bodies provide key services for children and families at risk on behalf of or in tandem with HSE services in areas such as residential care, foster care, community mentoring, family support such as Springboard, Teen Parenting, Youth Advocacy and many other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4686">Recent years have seen a period of major investment in child care and family support services to enable an appropriate response to child welfare concerns with over €240 million Government funds added to the annual investment in child care services since 1997.  The core principle underpinning all of these reforms and additional funding is to provide children and young people with the highest possible quality of care and to provide services to protect them, as far as possible, from all forms of harm.  The HSE have informed me that, at the end of 2007, 90% of children in care do have an allocated social worker and that social work services are available to all children in HSE care.  Increases in resources for child care and family support services have continued in recent years.  In addition to the significant number of additional social work posts HSE have created since 2005 the HSE have informed me that there has been an increase in funding of family support services of 79%, from €45.7m in 2003 to €81.8m in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4687">The focus for development in the coming years is on preventive, community-based services which provide early intervention within a Community/Primary Care context.  The development of alternative care services will, over time, impact on the numbers of children in residential and foster care.  International and Irish research indicates that in many situations cases can best be dealt with by way of welfare and care services which again do not always require full time social worker input to work well rather than by way of referral straight to child protection services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4688">The Agenda for Children's Services is the new overarching policy document of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for these areas and was launched in December 2007.  The Agenda with its clear renewed emphasis on family support coupled with reflective questions to enable service provider self evaluation represents the fundamental change now underway on how Government policy in relation to children is formulated and delivered.  It has been developed drawing on research and best practice at home and internationally.  It requires an outcomes focus and integrated service delivery in line with the recommendations of the recent OECD report.  To help implement the policy and principles in the Agenda, at the instigation of my office, the HSE have commenced the process of specifying a child welfare services policy.  This is vital to effective reform and rebalancing of children's services.  The OMCYA is represented on the steering group for the development of this policy working conjointly with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_4689">Recent instances of social work reform have shown how important communication and timely flows of commonly understood shared information are to success.  The Child Care Information Project which is initially implementing standard assessment and referral methods and thereafter moving on to better standardising national child protection procedures is very important in this area.  This project, in tandem with other major initiatives such as the review of the Children First child protection guidelines and the publication by HSE of their Child Protection Framework will work in synergy with the Knowledge Management Strategy for child welfare and protection (due to be completed in Summer 2008).  This will work to ensure availability of better information, improved communication and application of research findings to service provision, management evaluation and policy analysis.  As the above initiatives illustrate HSE are well aware of the need to work off well defined information and evidence; and not uncorroborated anecdote.  It is, however, essential that the evidence used is robust, validated material.</p>
            <p eId="para_4690">All of these initiatives are aimed at producing better integrated interagency service provision.  They also seek to provide for earlier intervention via much more comprehensive interlocking service provision for children, based on clear planning aimed at agreed outcomes in line with the move to family support initiatives.  I am confident that my office and the HSE can together ensure significantly improved better integrated child welfare and protection services for all children who need such services.  The work I have described shows how much is being done to realise this objective.</p>

            <p eId="para_4710">I take it the Deputy is referring to closing date of 31 December 2007 for receipt of applications under the Health Repayment Scheme.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the Health Repayment Scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.</p>
            <p eId="para_4711">The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.</p>
            <p eId="para_4712">Since the launch of the Health Repayment Scheme in August 2006, the HSE has informed my Department that it has undertaken extensive national and local media communication campaigns to ensure that potential applicants are made aware of the Scheme.  In addition, a series of nationwide road shows was undertaken to create awareness of the Scheme and to provide hands on support to applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4713">The HSE also undertook a final publicity campaign in December 2007 which consisted of a national print advertising campaign, a national radio advertising campaign which included advertisements in the Irish Independent, Irish Times, Irish Examiner, Sunday World and Sunday Independent.  In addition, a regional media campaign resulted in press releases issued to the local print press and regional radio interviews on 20 stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4714">The closing date for receipt of applications under the Scheme was set in the context of the HSE's current contractual arrangement with the scheme administrator which is due to expire on 30 June 2008.  In view of the various measures undertaken by the HSE/scheme administrator to maximise awareness of the scheme, I have decided not to extend the closing date for receipt of applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_4715">The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office is an independent office established to provide an appeals service to those who wish to appeal the decision of the Scheme Administrator.  The Appeals Office has advised my Department that as of 6 June 2008, 9 appeals have been lodged from applicants whose application was submitted after 31 December 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_4735">The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the Health Service Executive that some of the development funding provided for mental health services in 2007 was not used as planned because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation on the HSE to live within its overall Vote.  Consequently, some of the planned developments in mental health services have been delayed; however, it is anticipated that some of these delayed developments will be put in place in 2008.  These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_4736">the recruitment of 12 additional Child and Adolescent Consultant Psychiatrists and associated multi-disciplinary support.</p>
            <p eId="para_4737">the provision of 18 additional beds for children and adolescents at St. Anne's, Galway, St. Vincent's, Fairview and St. Stephen's Hospital, Cork, to increase the bed complement from the current provision of 12, to 30 during 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4738">The implementation of a ‘ <i>A Vision for Change</i>’ is a key priority for the recently established Office for Disability and Mental Health.

            <p eId="para_4768">Based on the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services, and the fact that the BreastCheck screening programme will significantly reduce the number of symptomatic breast cancer presentations, the Health Service Executive (HSE) determined that we require a total of eight specialist breast cancer centres nationally.  In order to comply with the Standards, the HSE has directed seventeen hospitals to cease breast cancer services.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services, including Mayo General Hospital, will occur over the next year in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_4769">The HSE has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the HSE Western Region, which includes County Mayo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar.</p>

            <p eId="para_4771">Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin provides acute secondary and tertiary hospital services for children.  The hospital receives a significant proportion of its funding from the Exchequer via the Health Service Executive. In 2008, the hospital has an allocation of €137m, up from €128m in 2007.  The hospital's budget has increased by over €38m since 2004, a 39% increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_4772">Each hospital funded by the HSE is required to deliver services within the financial allocation provided.  The HSE is involved in ongoing discussions with hospital management regarding its 2008 financial allocation and Service Plan.  The Hospital has an overrun of €10m from last year, and a projected overrun of €14m for this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4773">As part of the discussions on the budgetary position, the HSE has made an agreement with the Hospital, on a once off basis, to deal with last year's overrun of €10 million and to provide a further €7 million this year.  However, the additional funding arrangement is contingent on the hospital working within its budget which will be amended from €137 million to €144 million for this year.  The hospital must achieve savings of €7 million from the projected overrun of €14 million for 2008.  The priority of the HSE and hospital management is to ensure that services for children at the hospital are maintained at an optimum level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4774">The number of staff employed at the Hospital has increased by 433 whole time equivalents (WTE) since 2004.  At the end of March the number of WTEs employed at the hospital was 282 (20%) above the approved employment ceiling.  Such an excess over its employment ceiling creates considerable difficulty for a hospital in remaining within its budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_4775">The initial focus of the discussions between hospital management and the HSE is on ensuring that all areas of non-pay expenditure are critically examined.  Pay costs represent over 70% of the hospital's expenditure.  The hospital has indicated that there will be a need to reduce the number of temporary and agency staff numbers but it is not in a position at this point to confirm the number of posts involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_4776">Significant investment has been put into developing services at the Hospital in the last number of years in areas such as Cardiac, Haematology/Oncology and MRI Services.  Discussions are also at an advanced stage to create additional Intensive Care facilities at the Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_4777">My Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to revert to the Deputy on the operational issues raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_4827">Following the recruitment of the support teams, the next stage of the project will involve the preparation of a detailed Development Brief for the new hospital.  This will build on the work undertaken for the HSE by RKW, which involved the preparation of a High Level Framework Brief for the hospital.  The target of the Board is to have the Development Brief completed by the end of the 1st Quarter 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_4896">There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements have been made in several regions to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_4897">I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.  My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4898">I have been advised by the HSE that it will shortly be in a position to contact chiropodists offering them contracts to provide services and advising them of the revised fees payable for such services.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the Deputy advised when this has been accomplished.</p>

            <p eId="para_4902">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the Health Repayment Scheme in conjunction with the appointed Scheme Administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.  The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care including contract beds in private institutions. Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.</p>
            <p eId="para_4903">The HSE has advised my Department that a very high number of deficiencies have appeared on claim forms which must each be rectified before they can be processed.  The Scheme Administrator has taken a proactive role in addressing this issue. In many cases, the Scheme Administrator contacted the claimant to explain the deficiency on the form. This is particularly effective where either a letter has been sent seeking additional information and a response has not been received or where the deficiency is complicated. As a result of this proactive approach there are now less than 800 claim forms with deficiencies.  The Scheme Administrator is conscious of the fact that applications are being held up within the system and the proactive approach outlined is one of the initiatives undertaken to ensure claimants are repaid as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_4909">Cervical smear testing is not currently provided by GPs or family planning clinics under the scheme for medical card holders. However, where cervical smears form part of recognised protocols for the ongoing treatment of individual patient illnesses, they should be provided free of charge to eligible women under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. Any necessary follow-up treatment is available to all women, including medical card holders, within the public hospital system. The roll-out of a national cervical screening programme is the most efficient population approach to preventing and controlling cervical cancer.  The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) is planning to roll out such a programme on a national basis towards the end of the summer.   Women aged 25 to 44 years old will be screened every 3 years; women aged 45 to 60 will be screened every 5 years.  The service will be available free of charge to eligible women everywhere in the country.  Approximately 230,000 women will be screened annually, assuming an 80% take up by eligible women.  All elements of the programme — call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.  Additional revenue funding of €5.0m was allocated to the NCSS in 2007 for the roll-out of the programme and an additional €15.0m has been allocated in 2008.  An additional 30 posts have been approved to facilitate integration and roll-out of the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4936">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG and McCann Fitzgerald. The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care including contract beds in private institutions.  Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.  All applications must be assessed within this legal framework. The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office is an independent office established to provide an appeals service to those who wish to appeal the decision of the scheme administrator under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  My Department has no function in this independent appeals process. Under the Act, when an Appeals Officer has considered and assessed an appeal, a decision issues to the appellant together with the Appeals Officer's reasons for the decision.   A person affected by this decision may appeal to the High Court but only on a point of law from the decision and not later than 28 days after the appellant received a copy of the decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_4954">The launch of the National Recreation Policy last September highlighted Government's commitment to the development of youth cafés. As the Deputy will be aware there are already a number of youth cafés in operation around the country. Funding for these existing initiatives is provided through a number of bodies including local City/County Council and Health Service Executive. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs also operate a number of relevant funding programmes aimed at supporting community development, locally based community and voluntary groups as well as programmes aimed specifically at supporting projects for disadvantaged youth.</p>
            <p eId="para_4955">At this stage, my focus is to bring better coherence to the approach taken to date, retaining the strong inter-agency element and identifying an appropriate model(s) for youth cafés for future developments. Since September my office has undertaken a small survey of some of the existing cafés looking at mission/objectives, management and organisation, service levels and the role of young people.  It also requested the National Children's Advisory Council's advice on the development of a youth café model and research work has been commissioned by the Council in this regard.  I am anticipating the Council will be in a position to report to me shortly.  This work will guide government in ensuring that funding is targeted and co-ordinated most effectively on a model or models of youth cafés which meet the needs identified by young people themselves. Discussions are also underway with my Cabinet colleagues regarding a youth café programme and appropriate funding mechanisms. I am considering which agency could best lead on the programme and how to ensure any funding which might be made available augments, without displacing, the existing inter-agency resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_4959">The 2008 Service Plan, developed by the HSE and approved by me, included €50m for the development of additional disability services. The standard expenditure sanction issued to the HSE for 2008 stipulated that the prior approval of my Department and the Department of Finance would be required in the event of any proposal to spend this money for any other purpose. Clearly, it is essential that the HSE lives within its overall budget for the year. It needs to manage its activity levels and cost drivers appropriately to achieve this and I do not believe it is desirable to resort to using development funding to offset expenditure pressures arising in respect of ongoing health services. The HSE is currently reviewing its overall financial position for the year and the roll-out of planned developments in disability services is being considered in that context. I have been in communication with the HSE with a view to an early determination on the matter. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the named agency provided directly to the Deputy.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_706">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_5038">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_5039">The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over €500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</p>
            <p eId="para_5040">The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme was introduced on 1st January 2008 with an allocation of €154.2 million over 3 years.  The Scheme will continue to support community-based childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Community childcare services will qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The parent profile of each service, and the amount of subvention it will receive, are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which they return as part of the application process.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5041">The new scheme provides an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The subvention to services is responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage and the ceiling for funding which existed under the previous scheme has been removed.  Account is also being taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones which, in some cases, were previously inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5042">In addition, transitional arrangements have been put in place to facilitate community services which were funded under the previous scheme to adjust to the new arrangements, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  This will mean that community services which were funded under the previous scheme and which continue to operate, are guaranteed at least 95% of their 2007 grant aid in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5043">When the framework for the new scheme was announced in July of last year, my predecessor, Mr Brendan Smith T.D., signalled his intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which were to be forwarded to the Office of the Minister for Children in late 2007 as part of the application process of the new scheme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review was completed and the following adjustments were made to the scheme in December:</p>
            <p eId="para_5044">the childcare subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community childcare services, have been increased from €80 to €100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from €30 to €70 per week in the case of Band B parents;</p>
            <p eId="para_5045">services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by €45 per week per full-time place;</p>
            <p eId="para_5046">where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year;</p>
            <p eId="para_5047">special provisions will be provided for in the case of childcare services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women's refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required;</p>
            <p eId="para_5048">in recognition of the ongoing input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum grant level of €20,000 per annum has been introduced, provided services meet the conditions of the scheme in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_5049">as a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which could otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding is conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with, including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_5050">The changes which have been introduced will ensure that the most affordable childcare is available to families according to their means.  Put simply, the tiered fee structure is the most effective way of ensuring that the considerable and ongoing Government support for the community childcare sector, will be targeted at those who need it most.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that, with an allocation of €154.2 million over a 3 year period for the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme, the Government is continuing to offer very generous support to this important sector of Ireland's childcare infrastructure. Given the cost of the previous staffing Scheme was €37 million in 2007, this represents a very significant increase in resources to support the Community Childcare sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_5051">With regard to the Group in question, funding was approved in May 2008 for the period for July to December 2008.  The funding approved for the Group for this period amounts to 90% of the funding approved for the period Jan to July 2008.  From information supplied by the Group, the level of fees charged for their part-time service for July to December range from €25 to €75 with the top price charged to those not entitled to subvention under the CCSS.  The level of fees being charged is in the mid-range of fees being charged by community based services generally and compares favourably with equivalent fees in the commercial childcare sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_5093">I propose to take Questions Nos. 388 and 399 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5094">The Food Supplements Directive, 2002/46/EC, has been transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 506 of 2007.  That legislation is implemented by the Health Service Executive, under a Service Contract Agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  This ensures that consumers in Ireland are protected by the harmonised EU rules on the sale of food supplements, in particular the labelling of food supplements and chemical form of vitamins and minerals they contain.</p>
            <p eId="para_5095">One of the objectives of the Food Supplements Directive (2002/46/EC) was to make provision for the European Commission to determine maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.   The European Commission published a Discussion Paper on determining maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in June 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_5096">The Irish response to this paper, issued in November 2006, gave Ireland's view that the Commission should proceed on a cautious basis, setting maximum limits for as many vitamins and minerals as possible.  It was considered vital that the safety of the general population and the needs of particular subgroups such as pregnant women, children, older people and those on various specialist diets be taken into account in formulating the position on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5097">Discussions are ongoing at European level on the development of a methodology under which maximum safe levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will be set. Those discussions will permit the European Commission and Member States to further develop future direction on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_5099">The number of patients who had Clostridium difficile while a patient in the hospital referred to by the Deputy during the past 2 years was 272 in 2007 and 84 ( Jan — May) in 2008. Data for the previous 3 years is not yet available but I have requested the HSE to forward same to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_5100">Care must be taken when interpreting these global figures as account must be taken of size of hospital, case mix and age profile of patient.  In addition, in order to make meaningful comparisons of C.difficile  rates between hospitals, denominator data must be available so that rates can be expressed per patient admissions or patient days in hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_5101">C. difficile was not , up to now, a notifiable disease  and, as a result it was difficult to quantify the extent of  infection in the health care system.  In March 2008, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department instructed the HSE to make C. difficile a notifiable disease and since May 4 all cases are required to be notified to the relevant Department of Public Health.  The number of cases reported to date is within the range identified in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections in acute hospitals in 2006, 0.5% of patients studied.</p>
            <p eId="para_5102">The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) published Guidelines for the Surveillance, Management and Control of C. difficile-associated disease  on 22nd May last by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  They give national guidance and deal with the isolation of C. difficile ribotype 027 for the first time in Irish hospitals.  They will be a valuable resource in assisting in the prevention, management and control of this infectious disease.  The HSE is considering the report at present to decide on its implementation and I have asked to be kept informed of progress on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_5114">Under Phase 1, the NIB proposed a reduction from a 39 hour to a 37.5 hour working week by 1 June 2008. This reduction was to be achieved on a cost neutral basis and without diminution of service to patients on the basis of:</p>
            <p eId="para_5115">The package of measures would be based on the parameters for change, especially in rosters, skill mix and other productivity measures, which have been discussed at national level during the NIB talks;</p>
            <p eId="para_5116">Individual service locations would draw up a package of local changes which would enable the initial reduction in working hours to be implemented on a cost neutral basis in a manner which reflected the nature of the service being delivered in that location;</p>
            <p eId="para_5117">The Health Service Performance Verification Group (HSPVG) would provide an independent validation process to confirm that the changes planned for each location were sufficient to support the initial reduction and to verify delivery of these changes in advance of the target date for the reduction;</p>
            <p eId="para_5118">and the initial reduction would be implemented in each location on foot of such verification.</p>
            <p eId="para_5119">Under Phase 2, a Commission was to be established to produce an independent assessment of how a 35 hour week for nurses can be achieved. This Commission, which commenced work in March 2008,  is expected to report in December.  I have fully supported the efforts to introduce the 37.5 hour week for all nurses/midwives within the parameters set by the NIB. I have held regular meetings with senior management and union representatives to review progress in the achievement of this initial reduction in hours. I convened a special national conference last month at which representatives of service providers who had successfully concluded agreement shared best practice with those where agreement was still outstanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_5120">There are approximately 37,850 whole time equivalent nurses/midwives in the public health service. By the target date of 1 June 2008, local agreements had been reached at 62 locations covering some 10,363 nurses and midwives (approximately 27% of the total) and these had been validated by the HSPVG.</p>
            <p eId="para_5121">The NIB met with nursing unions and management representatives on 4 June to consider the implementation of the reduction in nursing hours under Phase I. It recommended that an immediate review of the problems arising in locations where agreement has not yet been possible should be carried out. This should take place at national, regional or local level as appropriate and in particular should take the form of clarification of the nature and scale of the problem which exists in each such location, to be followed by intense engagement in a problem-solving manner at local level in the light of the clarification received.</p>
            <p eId="para_5122">Last week a joint group of senior management and trade union representatives held fact finding meetings in a number of HSE regions. The outcome of these meetings will inform the report which will be submitted to the NIB for its consideration at a meeting to be held today.</p>
            <p eId="para_5123">A special meeting the HSPVG has also been scheduled for next Friday, the 20 June to validate further agreements that have been signed off by the HSE since the 1 June.</p>

            <p eId="para_5175">The recent increases in diesel prices are not particular to Ireland but reflect a global trend which is impacting on economic growth  internationally as well as in Ireland.  A number of sectors in our economy are feeling the brunt of these increases and the transport sector is one of these.  My Department has been in contact with the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) in the past number of weeks about the issue of rising fuel prices, and has provided assistance and information to them when Irish hauliers were being impacted by the protests that were taking place in France and elsewhere at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_5180">Road Safety is a regular feature of the Transport Sector of the North-South Ministerial Council and progress continues to be made in relation to cross border road safety issues.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5181">The area which has been most successful in terms of co-operation relates to the development of joint road safety advertising campaigns.  There are a number of such campaigns active at the moment including the ‘Just One' (Drink Driving), ‘Get it On' (Seatbelt Wearing) and ‘Mess' (Speeding) campaigns.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5182">Work is also continuing on a bilateral agreement to give effect to the EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications by late 2008/early 2009.  The mutual recognition of penalty points is a longer-term (3-4 year) project, which is being followed up under the auspices of the British Irish Council (BIC).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5183">As separate penalty point systems operate in each of the three jurisdictions, this is a much more complex legal and administrative issue than the mutual recognition of driver disqualifications, and will require the passage of primary legislation in both jurisdictions in due course.  A feasibility study on the matter is to be presented to my UK and NI colleagues and myself shortly.  I am in regular contact with my colleagues in Northern Ireland and the UK and am due to meet both the Northern Ireland and UK Ministers later this month to advance these matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_5289">I am aware of the role of the International Transport Workers Federation and in particular the work of SIPTU in relation to assisting seafarers on vessels calling at Irish ports.</p>
            <p eId="para_5290">The payment of wages on foreign flagged ships is a matter for the flag state where the ship is registered and is a matter for the internal domestic law of that country. However, Ireland does carry out inspections onboard foreign flagged ships in Irish ports under the auspices of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on port state control and EU directives.</p>
            <p eId="para_5291">Where appropriate when a valid complaint is received from SIPTU/ITF representing seafarers with concerns regarding shipboard living and working conditions on board a particular vessel, the vessel is considered as a priority for inspection by port state control in Ireland.  If the vessel cannot be inspected in Ireland, then a ship related message is placed on the Paris MoU's information system to alert the other member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_5292">The port state control inspections referred to above will cover the International Maritime Organisation's various safety and environment protection conventions as well as the International Labour Organisation Conventions.  The inspection of the latter would cover the welfare of the crew (food, accommodation, hours of work etc) but would exclude rates of pay.   Surveyors from my Department inspect over 400 foreign flagged ships per year and they detain vessels which pose a serious safety or environmental hazard or those on which the international requirements concerning living and working arrangements are not respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_5293">Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote global labour standards for seafarers. A new consolidated Maritime Labour Convention was adopted in February 2006 at the 94th International Labour Conference in Geneva.</p>
            <p eId="para_5294">Ireland was represented at the 94th Conference by a tripartite delegation consisting of Government officials, nominees of the employers (IBEC) and of the workers (ICTU). The new Convention sets out clear principles and rights for seafarers. Ireland fully supports the new Convention and voted in favour of the proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_5295">The European Commission has indicated that it will continue to study all possible solutions aimed at safeguarding employment in the maritime sector and that it would also continue to pursue the implementation of International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards into Community law and to encourage discussion on this issue within the framework of the European Social Dialogue.</p>

            <p eId="para_5314">Under the terms of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2408/92 of 23 July 1992, a Member State may, in limited circumstances, impose a Public Service Obligation (PSO) in respect of an air service and may subvent that service if no airline is prepared to operate it on a commercial basis. The main objective of the PSO programme is to provide air services to pre-specified standards for regions regarded as remote or under-developed and where it would not be commercially viable for air carriers to provide such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5315">Existing contractual arrangements for services linking Dublin with the regional airports in Kerry, Galway, Knock, Sligo, Donegal and Derry are due to expire on 22 July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5316">Prior to the commencement of the procurement process for the provision of air services on these routes after that date, a review of the existing programme was carried out in my Department.  I subsequently decided that tenders would be sought for the operation of services for the three-year period beginning on 22 July 2008 on the basis of maintaining the existing network and with the specifications for the routes (timetables, frequencies, capacity etc) largely unchanged from those which apply to the current round.</p>
            <p eId="para_5317">Following an EU public tendering process, contracts to provide scheduled air services on the six PSO regional air routes for the new contractual period were awarded to three airlines, involving a total maximum contracted subvention of €44.625 million.  A further review of all of the PSO air routes will be carried out towards the end of that period before any decisions are taken about subsequent arrangements and it would not therefore be appropriate to comment at this stage on the long term status of any particular PSO route.</p>

            <p eId="para_5347">The EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States below the EU minimum duty rate.  In the case of public transport services under my responsibility, these derogations included reduced rates to apply to fuel used for scheduled bus services. Scheduled bus services comprise bus passenger services provided by Bus Atha Cliath, Bus Eireann, private operators in accordance with bus route licences under the 1932 Road Transport Act and holders of Authorisations pursuant to European Council Regulation 684/92 as amended.</p>
            <p eId="para_5348">While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Finance Act 2008 provided the basis for the removal of these excise duty reliefs with effect from 1 November 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5349">My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other Departments, has been exploring whether alternative support mechanisms could be appropriate and could be done in a manner compatible with EU State Aid and other legal requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_5379">At the launch of Transport 21, the Government identified the programmes and projects in the national roads, public transport and regional airports sectors that it wishes to see prioritised for implementation in the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 within an overall capital provision of €34 billion.  That objective has not changed.  Significant progress has been made on Transport 21 in its first two years and a number of projects have been completed, are under construction or are well advanced in planning terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_5380">Most national road projects are now being completed ahead of schedule and almost all of the projects opened in 2007 were on or ahead of time, while significant advances have been made on the development of public transport projects.  While the majority of projects will be delivered ahead of or in accordance with the indicative timetable published at the launch of Transport 21, the huge scale of the programme is such that adjustments to the timescale for individual projects is inevitable.  The value of the ten-year financial framework is that it gives us the flexibility to deal with this in an effective way.</p>
            <p eId="para_5381">The necessary revisions to completion dates have arisen for a range of reasons including changes to the scope of projects arising from public consultation, planning issues, procurement issues and archaeological difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_5397">The Government of Colombia has repeatedly stated its commitment to bringing to an end all terrorism in Colombia within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law. This Law, passed in 2005, provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society. The Justice and Peace Law, which was adopted through a lengthy democratic political process, strikes a difficult balance between peace and justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5398">The process of peace negotiations between the Colombian Government and the right-wing paramilitary group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) began in 2003, with between 30,000 and 40,000 combatants having been demobilized on completion of the process in 2007. The Government of Colombia is currently engaging in dialogue with the left-wing guerrilla group known as the Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Colombia (ELN) in pursuit of a negotiated peace agreement. Negotiations between the major left-wing guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), and the Government have not yet commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_5399">The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union most recently adopted Conclusions on Colombia on 19 November 2007. Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of these Conclusions, which expressed the EU's total solidarity with the Colombian people, its full support for the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and underlined the importance the EU attaches to the ongoing implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.</p>
            <p eId="para_5400">The Council further expressed its hope that progress would be made in taking forward negotiations in order to reach a humanitarian agreement, to secure the release of all hostages, to end the armed conflict and to bring lasting peace to Colombia. In the same spirit, the Council welcomed all initiatives taken with the Colombian Government's support with the objective of promoting a successful peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5401">My Department continues to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. Ireland is fully supportive of efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Colombia, and will continue to support the Government of Colombia in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including through direct engagement. Where such efforts have the support of the Colombian Government, Ireland very much welcomes the mediation of third parties in the pursuit of a solution to the conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_5402">A number of EU Member States, which have a history of involvement in the region, have been active in seeking to mediate between the Colombian Government and the left-wing guerrilla groups, efforts which are fully supported by Ireland and our EU partners. While, in discussions at EU level, we have not considered that current conditions call for UN involvement in the ending of terrorist activity in Colombia, Ireland would be supportive were the Colombian Government to request such intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_5403">In conjunction with our EU partners, the Irish government will continue to examine how we may, as appropriate, contribute to the peace process in Colombia. In this regard, I take note of the ideas outlined in the documentation submitted by the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5422">I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 and 496 to 501, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5423">The situation in Zimbabwe continues to be both shocking and deeply disturbing. With voting in the second round of the Presidential election due to take place on 27 June, the situation remains violent and unstable. At least 50 people have been killed since March, and targeted violence has resulted in thousands being displaced, rendering it impossible for them to vote. Opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) activists — including MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai himself — have repeatedly been arrested and detained. Political meetings have been banned. The opposition has no access to the state controlled media. Suspected MDC supporters are being sacked from their jobs, and in many cases have been beaten and tortured. Most recently, and very worryingly, the decision by President Mugabe to suspend NGO activities — including the delivery of humanitarian aid and the provision of health services — will potentially threaten lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_5424">I welcomed the wide consensus on Zimbabwe in the Dáil when we debated the issue on 15 May. We agreed then on the urgent need to end violence and to create an environment conducive to a fair election. We agreed on the importance of election monitoring and on continued Irish Aid support for the Zimbabwean people. We also agreed on the pivotal role which Zimbabwe's neighbours have to play in resolving this crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5425">In keeping with the wish expressed by many Deputies that Ireland's views be conveyed at EU level, at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations meeting in Brussels on 26 May, Ireland urged that strong political pressure on the Mugabe regime be maintained until the crisis is resolved. Following that discussion, EU Foreign Ministers again called on the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure a level playing field and a secure environment, so that the results of the second round will reflect the free and democratic will of the Zimbabwean people. They specifically underlined the importance of the publication of results outside polling stations, as stipulated by Zimbabwean law. EU Foreign Ministers again discussed the situation in Zimbabwe yesterday, 16 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_5426">The Government would have strongly supported election monitoring by Irish observers through the EU or UN, and it is clear that there was also strong support in the Dáil for this approach. However, Zimbabwean Government representatives have explicitly made clear their refusal to accept monitors from the EU or from any EU Member State. The consent of the host country is a practical necessity — without permission to visit polling stations and count centres, it is not possible to make a credible assessment of the election.</p>
            <p eId="para_5427">Ireland and the EU have strongly supported monitoring of the Zimbabwean election by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and by the African Union, and we have encouraged both organisations to increase their number of monitors over the first round. SADC monitors have already begun deploy, well in advance of polling day, the importance of which many Deputies had stressed. However, local observers, who played an important role in the first round, have been told that their invitations are no longer valid for the second round. Many local observers have also been attacked and beaten as a result of their work.</p>
            <p eId="para_5428">Since the current phase of the Zimbabwe crisis began after the 29 March elections, Ireland has conveyed our concerns about Zimbabwe directly to our partner countries in Africa. We have encouraged the countries of the Southern African region to continue to take the lead in pressurizing the Mugabe regime to respect the democratic verdict of the Zimbabwean people. The Irish Ambassador to Zimbabwe, who is resident in South Africa, also travelled to Zimbabwe to witness the election on 29 March, and will do so again for the 27 June round. Overall, however, experience shows that it is not possible to impose solutions from the outside, and there are few effective levers for the EU to put pressure on Zimbabwe, so the influence which Zimbabwe's neighbours bring to bear is crucial in securing change. There are also continuing reports of efforts at mediation, possibly with a view to establishing a Government of National Unity.</p>
            <p eId="para_5429">As regards a peacekeeping force, conditions on the ground in Zimbabwe are not currently appropriate for such deployment. Peacekeepers are generally most effective when deployed in support of an existing peace agreement. However, in the event of a political settlement in Zimbabwe, it is not clear that a peacekeeping force would be required at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_5430">Many Deputies have made helpful proposals about how Ireland should react to positive change in Zimbabwe, and it is in the context of such a positive transformation that such issues can best be considered, including examining how Irish Aid can make a strong and significant contribution to the new democratic dispensation that hopefully will be in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_5444">There were a number of public relation initiatives undertaken by my Department in 2007. The contracts in question arose in very specific circumstances where the Department was required to carry out information and awareness-raising campaigns.</p>
            <p eId="para_5445">As part of the promotion of the public awareness and understanding of the work of the expanding Irish Aid programme, a number of public relation initiatives were undertaken in 2007:</p>
            <p eId="para_5446">Bannon and Bannon (now part of Grayling PR) were paid €5,082 for public relations services for the Hunger Task Force;</p>
            <p eId="para_5447">A consultant, Ms. Daire Higgins, was paid €24,750 to promote the opening of the Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre in Dublin as part of the campaign to inform the public of its services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5448">Both contracts were awarded following competitive processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5449">Also in 2007, the Department's Communicating Europe Initiative paid a sum of €4,039 to Rachel Dalton Communications to promote and publish the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Sub Committee on European Scrutiny (the Sub-Committee was in place in the 29th Dáil). The Committee was ultimately responsible for the recruitment of the Consultant, for setting out the terms and conditions of employment and for ensuring that the services provided represented value for money.

            <p eId="para_5450">I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on consultancy expenditure.

            <p eId="para_5486">Irish employers meet the majority of their labour needs from within the expanded EU labour market. For non-European Economic Area (EEA) Nationals, the granting of an employment permit is dependant on a job offer from a prospective Irish employer. Applications, which can be submitted by either the prospective employee or employer, are considered under the Employment Permits Acts, 2003 and 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_5487">Section 1 of the Employment Permits Act, 2006, provides that employment agencies, which are effectively recruiting individuals to work for third parties, are not to be regarded as employers for the purposes of the Act. Therefore, a recruitment agency may only apply for an employment permit if they themselves are the prospective employer and if the prospective employee is to be directly employed by them. The usual regulations surrounding such an application will apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_5488">Section 2 of the Employment Permits Act, 2006, also states that it is an offence for a Foreign National to be in employment without an Employment Permit granted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_5490">My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_5491">The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards provide a source of support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants.  All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects, which should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</p>
            <p eId="para_5492">I would suggest that the person concerned should, in the first instance, make direct contact with The Kildare County Enterprise Board and explore what level of assistance, if any, may be available to them. The Board can be contacted at The Woods, Clane, Co. Kildare, Tel No. 045 861 707 or by email to info@kildareceb.ie (website www.kildareceb.ie).</p>

            <p eId="para_5495">In addressing this, the Department has been cognisant of other policy initiatives impacting on the introduction of a Knowledge Base for business, including the Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing published on 2 April 2008 which endorsed the Small Business Forum's recommendation in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5496">In addition, developments at EU level in relation to the establishment of ‘points of single contact' for businesses operating within the Single Market under the Services Directive, will also have to be taken into consideration in terms of the potential scope of the Knowledge Base proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5497">A timescale of at least two years is envisaged for the implementation of this project in an appropriate manner.

Notwithstanding this, the UCPD had been the subject of a number of public consultations with stakeholders. The Government decision approving the establishment of the NCA on statutory basis predated the requirement that an RIA should be applied to all proposals for primary legislation involving changes to the regulatory framework.

In terms of costs, specific proposals in the Bill which have the potential to give rise to certain costs on the part of existing companies were identified and an estimation as to their magnitude and to whom they might fall was made.  A full analysis of the potential costs is included in Chapter 4 of the Report on the General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill 2007 or at www.clrg.org.

            <p eId="para_5558">The total amount spent on the enterprise STI sub-programme in 2007 was €15.8m current and €111.6m capital.  The enterprise STI spend for the period January to May 2008 inclusive is €5.1m current and €29.6m capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_5559">The NDP allocation for the enterprise STI sub-programme for 2007 was €16.9m current and €106.7m capital.  The outturn for 2007 represents a saving of €1.1m in current expenditure and an increase of €5.0m in capital expenditure.  The current savings arise from normal fluctuations in programme costs and delays in a small number of programmes, and the increase in capital expenditure was met through capital carry over from 2006.  The NDP projections for 2008 for the enterprise STI sub-programme are €17.7m current and €126.6m capital.  The actual allocations in the 2008 Revised Estimates are €15.8m current and €126.6m capital.  A lower than anticipated increase to STI awareness activity was agreed pending the outcome of an international review of needs in this area.  It will be clear from the foregoing that substantially all funding promised under the NDP has been made available.  It is expected that the 2008 allocations will be spent, but many of the programmes funded by the enterprise sub-programme are demand led, and variations may arise as a result of issues with timing and demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_5560">It should be noted that there is a further €5m allocation under the enterprise sub-programme in each of the years 2007 and 2008 relating to the National Digital Research Centre which falls under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_5595">One of the key programmes to encourage the employment of people with disabilities is the Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5596">The Wage Subsidy Scheme is operated by FÁS on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Scheme is available to all employers (except public service employers and/or any employers or schemes where wages are funded by FÁS) in the State who provide a minimum of 21 hours of employment per week to disabled workers.  The objective of the scheme is to increase the number of persons with a disability in employment, and as far as practicable provide a level playing field for them in seeking out or remaining in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5597">An independent consultancy of the Wage Subsidy Scheme, which has been commissioned by my Department, has recently been completed and is now being considered by my Department in consultation with FÁS.  The findings of this review will inform the Department and FÁS on how the effectiveness of the programme may be enhanced in the future as an incentive to both employers and disabled employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_5598">The FÁS Supported Employment programme is another programme in this area which is an open labour market initiative providing supports to people with disabilities to help them access employment opportunities in the open labour market.  The programme is implemented by sponsor organisations on behalf of FÁS, which employ job coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  The ultimate outcome is that the employee becomes independent of job coach support.</p>
            <p eId="para_5599">FÁS has commissioned an independent consultancy review on the operations and effectiveness of the Supported Employment programme.  The consultants' report has recently been finalised and is being considered by FÁS in consultation with my Department.  The report will inform changes and improvements in the future operation of the programme based on its analysis and recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5600">The total budget for FÁS programmes and schemes aimed at facilitating employment and training opportunities for people with a disability has been increased from €73.7 million in 2007 to €77 million in the current year.</p>

        <b>Deputy Pádraic McCormack</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         if the reason the price of oil is increasing has been investigated in view of the fact that the value of the dollar is decreasing; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [23219/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_814">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5602">The Deputy will be aware that since the beginning of the year the wholesale price of oil has increased considerably. This increase, which has been caused by a combination of strong demand, tight capacities and some market speculation, has led in turn to increases in the retail price of petrol, diesel and other fuels. At the same time as oil, which is priced in dollars, has been increasing in price, the Euro has been steadily appreciating in value against the dollar. This appreciation has helped to cushion consumers in the Euro area, including Irish consumers, from experiencing the full extent of the increases in the wholesale price of oil. In the absence of this favourable appreciation between the Euro and the dollar, Irish consumers would most likely be paying significantly more at the petrol pump.</p>
            <p eId="para_5603">Government policy in relation to prices, including the price of commodities such as petrol and diesel, is concentrated on the promotion of competition, consumer choice and awareness.  There is no price control on these products and in common with most other goods and services price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy.  It is a matter for retailers to explain price differences where they occur and my Department encourages consumers to raise price concerns directly with retailers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5604">The Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order, 1997 requires petrol stations to display their prices in a clear and prominent manner in order that consumers can make an informed choice.  The Order enables consumers to readily compare prices and purchase their fuel on the basis of an informed choice. The National Consumer Agency (NCA) enforces this Order.   Any infringements should be reported to the NCA.</p>
            <p eId="para_5605">It is important, therefore, particularly in times of rising oil prices, that consumers inform themselves of the prices being charged by different traders for fuel products such as diesel and petrol so that they can achieve the best value for their money. I am satisfied that the statutory Regulations in this area ensure that consumers are given the necessary price information to allow them to make informed choices when purchasing fuel.</p>

The number required to decentralise from the NSAI is 132.  To date, no costs have been incurred by the NSAI in relation to the provision of new accommodation as part of the decentralisation programme.

It would not be possible to give definitive costings in advance of final agreement on specific proposals.  It is expected however that overall costs will remain within the published estimate figures.</p>

            <p eId="para_5868">State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies.  While I may give general policy directives to the agencies, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings, or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_5869">In line with the National Spatial Strategy IDA Ireland seeks to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) into Mayo through the linked hubs of Ballina and Castlebar, as well as the town of Westport.  The Agency aims to attract new knowledge intensive projects in the Medical Technologies, Life Sciences, Information Communications Technology and International Services sectors.  In addition, the Agency works with its' existing base of overseas companies in County Mayo to encourage them to grow and expand.  A successful outcome of this approach has been the announcement, last November, by Baxter International Inc, a world leading healthcare company, of its intention to invest more than €75 million over a six year period as part of a strategic programme to introduce new technologies and higher value products to its manufacturing plants in Castlebar and Swinford.  In total, there are over 3,000 people employed in IDA supported companies in County Mayo.</p>
            <p eId="para_5870">In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies and the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies.  The overall aim of Enterprise Ireland's strategy is to transform Irish companies into market focused and innovation driven businesses to increase their exports, sales and employment. Enterprise Ireland works with 124 client companies in County Mayo, which employ a total of 3,155 people in the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_5871">In addition, the Mayo County Enterprise Board (CEB) provides a source of support throughout Mayo for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.</p>
            <p eId="para_5872">I am satisfied that co-operation of the agencies on the ground together with the roll out of the National Development Plan will continue to bear fruit in terms of enterprise and job creation for the people of Mayo.</p>

Applications for funding under the 2008 programme were invited through advertisements in the Press on 13 and 14 January and the deadline for receipt of applications was 29 February for paper-based applications and 7 March for on-line applications.  All applications received before the deadline, including those from the organisations in question, are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.  I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_5908">A sum of €184 million has been provided under the National Development Plan 2007 — 2013 to complete existing commitments under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, closed since 31 July 2000, and to launch a new round of the programme.  Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department, grant aid is provided to local authorities towards the capital costs of a new or replacement public swimming pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool provided by local authorities themselves or by other bodies where the application for capital funding is supported by the local authority.  Under the Programme there are four stages in a swimming pool project.  These, in order of progress, are: Feasibility Study/Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Local authorities may not proceed to the next stage of a project until prior approval issues from my Department.  Grant aid is only formally allocated when the tender is approved.  The Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5909">Of the 57 projects within the current round, 45 have been formally approved grant aid, of which 34 have been completed and 11 are under construction or about to start construction.  Two projects are out to tender and ten are at earlier stages in the process.  Some €37.4 million was paid out between January 2007 and May 2008, the period covered by the €184 million allocated under the national development plan to date.  Commitments of €23.3 million have been entered into to cover the 11 projects formally approved grant aid but not yet paid.  On the basis that the 12 remaining projects at earlier stages in the process will proceed to completion, and each receives the maximum grant of €3.8 million, a total of some €45.6 million will be required to complete this round.  Projects under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme can be completed if the local authorities which are leading the projects continue to press ahead with construction on schedule.  Projects, once they reach construction stage, take about 18 months to complete.  As it takes a long time to get projects to the construction stage, however, it is difficult to say when all projects under the current round will be completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_5917">I propose to take Questions Nos. 537 to 539, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5918">In 2006, the Government decided to proceed with the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre by way of a public private partnership on a site at George's Dock, on a build, finance and maintain basis.  This site was chosen following an extensive search exercise conducted by the Office of Public Works.  Arising from the Government decision, an inter-agency steering committee was set up to oversee the project.  The committee is chaired by the Department and comprises representatives of the National Development Finance Agency, the OPW, the Abbey Theatre and Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  At its first meeting the steering group decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the OPW should prepare the documentation necessary for holding an international design competition for the new Abbey Theatre.  An international design competition was one of the conditions of the offer of the site by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5919">A project team, chaired by the Office of Public Works and comprising representatives of the same agencies as the steering group, has been established and is overseeing the executive and procedural arrangements for holding the international design competition and advancing the public private partnership process.  The OPW has asked the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland to organise the competition.  The competition regulations are nearing finalisation.  The technical documentation for the competition must be carefully specified, in particular the detailed accommodation brief for the new theatre.  Work on this is nearing completion.  A jury for the international design competition was appointed late last year.  In the meantime, the OPW is working on drafting output specifications in collaboration with the Department, the Abbey Theatre and the National Development Finance Authority.  Technical, legal, insurance and financial advisers have been appointed to guide and advise the inter-agency teams in the procurement of this epochal and crucial project.  A theatre consultant and acoustic consultant have also been appointed.  Furthermore, a process auditor is in place in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_5920">The project is complex and there are a myriad of technical, procedural and legal factors to address in making progress on it.  It is a priority for the Department and the Government in the Programme for Government and the National Development Plan.  When a winning design has been chosen, the National Development Finance Agency will oversee the PPP procurement process in accordance with PPP guidelines.  I am confident that when the international design competition is complete we will have a world class design for a new iconic landmark building for the city and the new quayside theatre will be a dynamic structure reflecting Dublin's growing reputation as a global capital of culture and creativity.</p>

It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level.  Under the programme, priority is given to the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities.  Primary and post-primary schools wishing to be considered for funding under the programme may apply for funding jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must meet other conditions including a requirement that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility, for at least 30 hours a week throughout the year, when it is not being used by the school.  Any facility proposed for funding by a sporting organisation and which would be located within school grounds would have to meet the conditions.  Applications from primary and post-primary schools and colleges on their own are not considered under the programme.  Work on the development of a National Sports Facility Strategy is under way in my Department.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment at national, regional and local level.  An inter-agency steering group has been established to oversee this work and includes representation from the Department of Education and Science.  The work of this group has included discussions with the Department of Education and Science on how its policy on the provision of sports hall facilities and my Department's policy for the provision of sports facilities might be complementary.</p>

            <p eId="para_5950">The National Development Plan, 2007-13, contains a wide range of capital schemes and projects which will be progressively rolled out by my Department over the lifetime of the plan.  The NDP includes an €800m Tourism Development Programme, a €904m Cultural Sub-Programme and a €991m Sport Sub-Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5951">As regards Tourism, the international marketing sub-programme is on track, with a budget of €50m provided in 2008.  Construction work on the Convention Centre Dublin commenced in 2007 and the steel works for the new building at Spencer Dock are already well advanced. A range of programmes are being advanced in the product development area, including a fund to create tourism attractions of international class and a fund for investment in activity/adventure products.</p>
            <p eId="para_5952">On the sports side, construction of the new Lansdowne Road Stadium is now well underway and it is planned that the 50,000 seater stadium will open during 2010.  Following the recent appointment of a Project Management team and a Design Team, detailed work on the National Sports Campus at Abbotstown is proceeding.  Applications for funding under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme were invited in January last and over 1,450 applications have been received and are currently being assessed.  The Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme is also progressing well and €184m has been allocated to the programme under the NDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_5953">In the arts and culture sector, a new National Concert Hall will be developed on the existing site at Earlsfort Terrace.  It is planned to initiate the PPP procurement competition very shortly, with a view to contracts being signed in 2009.  The redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre at George's Dock is also progressing well, with the appointment of a jury for the design competition and the appointment of technical and financial advisors.  The Wexford Festival Opera House is on schedule for completion in 2008, while the Gaiety Theatre project has been successfully completed.  Progress is being made on the extensions to all of the main National Cultural Institutions.  Projects under the ACCESS Programme are continuing to draw down funds which amount to €81 m over the course of the NDP.  Details of the budget allocations under the National Development programme are listed below.</p>

            <p eId="para_6012">Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels and in landlord income.  This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6013">Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure.  This discretionary power is only used in special cases, but it ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6014">The Executive has advised that while the rent payable is in excess of the prescribed maximum rent limits, it has taken into account the exceptional circumstances of this case and has awarded a weekly rent supplement of €56.20 to the person concerned.  This is the maximum rent supplement payable taking account of the financial circumstances of the person concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_6016">To qualify for a State Pension Non-Contributory, a person or couple must be habitually resident in the State and satisfy a means test.  In determining means, the weekly income derived from occupational pensions, farming, and/or self employment by claimant and/or spouse or partner is assessed.  Where a person/couple has savings and investments and any property (excluding a person's own home), the capital value from such items is assessed using a formula to calculate the weekly means as outlined in the following table.</p>
            <p eId="para_6017">Having assessed the weekly means, a disregard of €30 per week for a single person or €60 for a couple is then applied.   For example, a couple with no income but with capital of up to €80,000 can qualify for a pension at the maximum rate.</p>

            <p eId="para_6037">I propose to take Questions Nos. 554 and 560 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6038">My Department has produced a number of Screening Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) since the Government Decision to introduce this policy. These related to the Citizens Information Bill 2006; the inclusion of trust-based Retirement Annuity Contracts under the relevant provisions of the Pensions Act (Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007); and amendments to provisions relating to the supplementary welfare allowance (Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007). A further two screening RIAs on the implementation of proposals on trusteeship were carried out as part of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2008. Finally, a screening RIA was applied by my Department to the ‘Amended proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights'. This latter RIA is a work in progress as negotiations on the proposed Directive are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_6039">In carrying out regulatory impact analyses, my Department has regard to the RIA guidelines produced by the Department of the Taoiseach. Where certain impacts specified in the guidelines are identified, and these impacts are deemed to be significant, it is advised that a full RIA should be carried out. In each case listed above, it was not deemed necessary to carry out a full RIA as the screening RIAs did not find that the relevant impacts reached the thresholds set out in the Guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_6040">Given the time constraints involved, the annual Social Welfare Bill which implements PRSI and other changes to social welfare legislation arising from the Budget, has not been subject to regulatory impact analysis. However, my Department undertakes significant ex-ante analysis of these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_6041">In relation to secondary legislation, the RIA guidelines state that only significant Statutory Instruments are subject to RIA. In this regard, given that these are largely technical in nature, my Department has not conducted a regulatory impact analysis on a Statutory Instrument over the period.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_6049">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  There are currently over 61,000 tenants benefiting from assistance under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6050">The community welfare service must satisfy itself that an applicant for rent supplement has a genuine accommodation need for which he or she cannot provide, that a bona fide tenancy arrangement exists between the applicant and the landlord and that the property being rented is suitable to his or her needs.   In determining whether the accommodation is suited to the person's accommodation needs, a community welfare officer must establish the household composition, the size of the accommodation unit and identify any special needs that the person may have. As part of this process, the officer may carry out a visit to the residential premises in question. This home visit may also be used to confirm the applicant's residence at the address in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_6051">The community welfare service may consider that a property is not suited to the applicant's needs if the accommodation does not appear to meet minimum housing standards. However, responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with local authorities.  The community welfare service is not qualified to undertake this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6052">Under legislative provisions introduced by the Department in 2006 and 2007, the community welfare service can decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards. Where the community welfare service becomes aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appear to it to be sub-standard, it notifies the local authority and it may advise prospective tenants at that premises that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of those tenancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_6053">Details of long-term rent supplement tenancies are provided to local authorities via the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Over 30,000 cases have been notified to date and this information sharing assists in enforcing housing standards. In addition, details of rent supplement tenancies are provided to the Private Residential Tenancies Board in order to ensure that tenancies are registered with the Board by landlords.  Revenue generated from registration of new tenancies supports the inspection of housing standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_6054">The Department is committed to supporting the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government Action Programme which aims to promote further improvements in private rented accommodation standards, including a review of the regulations and more effective enforcement.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_6058">Under the EU's Open Method of Co-ordination on Social Protection and Social Inclusion, each member state is required to prepare a National Report on Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion (NSSPI). This report sets out strategic priorities in the policy areas of social inclusion, pensions and health and long term care. My department is currently preparing Ireland's NSSPI for the period 2008 to 2010 which will be submitted to the European Commission in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_6059">The NSSPI brings together actions and policy priorities already agreed in the individual government strategies such as the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and the Pensions Green Paper. The Government recognises the benefits of involving people directly experiencing poverty or social exclusion and the organisations which work closely with them, in such strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_6060">The consultation process for the various strategies on social inclusion being prepared in the period 2005-2007, commenced in September 2005. Written submissions were sought and a series of seminars were organised to facilitate the participation within the strategic social inclusion process of people with direct experience of poverty and social exclusion and those who work with them. Many health issues impacting on social inclusion were also covered by this process. The outcome of the consultation process was available for the Social Partnership talks that informed the development of the social inclusion provision of <i>Towards 2016,</i> published in June 2006, the NAPinclusion 2007-2016, published in February 2007, and the social inclusion chapter of the National Development Plan, published in January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_6061">In line with the commitment in <i>Towards 2016</i>, the First Annual Report on Social Inclusion was published in November 2007. This new approach required that monitoring and reporting on progress within the social partnership be coordinated and streamlined across key national strategies, including <i>Towards 2016</i>, the NAPinclusion, and the social inclusion commitments of the NDP. The report covers the period from June 2006 (when <i>Towards 2016</i> was agreed) up to June 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_6062">The report was prepared by the Office for Social Inclusion in consultation with relevant Government Departments and representatives of the social partners. The report formed the basis for discussions at the 4th Social Inclusion Forum held in November 2007.  This forum is convened annually by the National Economic and Social Forum in collaboration with the Office for Social Inclusion and provides an opportunity for individuals and organisations not directly involved in the social partnership process to input their views on key policy and implementation issues. Some 300 persons attended and the discussions and issues raised at the forum will further inform the preparation of the NSSPI 2008-2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6063">My Department also published a Green Paper on Pensions on the 17th October 2007 and immediately began a major consultation process on the issues and challenges raised in the Green Paper.  A national awareness campaign was launched where all citizens were invited to make submissions on the Green Paper either in writing or via the Green Paper website.  In addition the Department held seminars in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Tullamore and Sligo in March 2008. The consultation process was concluded with a conference in Dublin castle on the 29th May 2008. In excess of 330 submissions were received and these will inform the framework for future pension policy which will be developed by the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6064">Given the relatively short period since the preparation of these strategies and the extensive consultation involved in these processes, it was decided that a further wide consultation process for the next NSSPI for the period 2008-2010 would only duplicate recent consultation exercises.</p>
            <p eId="para_6065">A wide and more detailed consultation on Social Inclusion is being planned in the context of 2010, which is expected to be designated shortly by the EU as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_6066">The implementation of National Strategies in these and other areas is of course subject to systematic ongoing monitoring under well established procedures involving all of the social partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_6082">The Department aims to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur.  The provision of information in a clear and accessible manner is an essential element in the achievement of this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_6083">The Department uses a mix of advertising media including national and provincial newspapers, radio and television, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots to ensure that people are aware of their social welfare entitlements and are notified about improvements and changes affecting their payments and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_6084">Expenditure in the region of €300,000 was incurred in a FIS awareness campaign in 2006.  The campaign included TV, radio, newspaper and poster advertising.</p>
            <p eId="para_6085">The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed (INOU) received funding of over €7,500 in December 2007 and €2,200 in June 2008 under the Department's Information Grants Scheme to produce and distribute Family Income Supplement posters and leaflets.  A total of 1,500 posters and 31,000 leaflets were printed in English, Irish, Polish, Russian, Chinese and Portuguese.  Electronic copies were also available in French, Arabic, Romanian, Spanish.</p>
            <p eId="para_6086">The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands.  The available resources are then used to discharge the Department's obligations towards its customers and in implementing cost effective controls to prevent and detect fraud and abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_6087">The volume of family income supplement (FIS) claims on hands awaiting finalisation and the delays in processing are a consequence of increased scheme take up following improvements made to qualifying income thresholds in recent budgets and the publicity campaigns promoting the scheme.  There is a backlog of some 4,700 claims awaiting finalisation at present.  The Department has introduced a number of measures to improve claim processing for FIS and to deal with arrears of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6088">A review of existing processes and procedures has been undertaken with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing.  Priority is being given to claims where a claim is being renewed to ensure continuity of payment.  The ongoing staffing requirement was recently reviewed in light of the increased volumes of claims.  Overtime working is being judiciously applied and 5 extra temporary staff have been recruited to help eliminate the backlog</p>
            <p eId="para_6089">Good progress is being made on foot of these measures and it is expected the backlog will be substantially cleared in the coming months.  The position is being closely monitored by the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_6097">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_6098">The operation of this scheme was reviewed in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions, with particular regard being paid to the operative date of the scheme and the use of credits for pension purposes rather than the current system of disregards.</p>
            <p eId="para_6099">Alternative means of providing pensions for homemakers, and others at present outside the social welfare pension system, are also explored in the Green Paper, including the use of universal entitlements with qualifying criteria based around residence rather than contributions.</p>

            <p eId="para_6110">My Department currently operates a range of schemes for people with an illness or disability including the insurance based illness benefit and invalidity pension, the means-tested disability allowance and blind person's pension, and occupational injury benefit for those who are unable to work because of an accident suffered at work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6111">In line with other payments provided by my Department to people of working age, the aim of the illness and disability payment schemes is to provide income support to those who cannot secure an adequate income from employment.  In the case of insurance based benefits, security is provided against the loss of personal income in the event of illness while, in the case of the means tested payments, assistance is provided to those whose employment capacity is substantially restricted and whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents.</p>
            <p eId="para_6112">The rates of payment for all of the above schemes have increased significantly in re cent years in line with the increases for other social welfare payments.  For example, the personal rate for disability allowance rose by 33 per cent, from €148.80 to €197.80 in the three year period between 2005 and 2008.  These increases have not been linked to any particular index or benchmark but instead have been largely determined by reference to commitments entered into by the Government such as the Programme for Government, the social partnership agreements and in the NAPinclusion process.  The net effect of these commitments has been to deliver level of increases well ahead of both price and earnings inflation over the period in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_6113">The issue of the additional costs of living faced by those people with a disability has been acknowledged on many occasions, not least by the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and by my own Department in the Report of the Working Group on the Review of the Illness and Disability Payment Schemes.  Both reports noted that any provision for addressing the additional costs of disability should be separated from the existing system of income maintenance payments and instead constitute a separate ‘cost of disability' payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6114">In order to examine the feasibility of the introduction of such a payment, a working group was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF), with cross-departmental membership which included my Department and was chaired by the Department of Health and Children.  The group concluded that comprehensive data on which to base consideration of the introduction of a cost of disability payment is vital, together with a structured process of the assessment of need.  The group recommended that steps be taken to improve the quality of data relating to disability in Ireland and it is expected that this will be addressed in the context of the forthcoming National Disability Survey, the results of which are due to be released shortly by the CSO.  The group also recommended that other issues around the cost of disability should be considered following the development of a needs assessment system provided for under Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005, which is currently being progressed by the Department of Health and Children and the Health Services Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_6115">The group also examined the scope for addressing barriers that exist for people with disabilities who wish to undertake or increase their employment and thus move to a position of greater economic independence.  In this regard my Department recently introduced a change to the withdrawal rate of disability allowance and blind pension for income in excess of the current earnings disregard level which means that a single person can earn up to a maximum of €432 per week from rehabilitative employment before their disability allowance or blind pension is fully withdrawn.  This change has resulted in a 40 per cent increase in the number of people since June 2006 availing of employment in order to increase their overall income while receiving disability allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_6116">In terms of ensuring adequate levels of income for people with disabilities, the current ten-year Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, includes the commitment to work for the continued enhancement and integration of supports in line with overall social welfare targets.  These will include a rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities in the context of the Government's policy of mainstreaming and the proposed transfer of functions from the Health Services Executive to my Department which includes a number of disability-related schemes, including domiciliary care allowance, mobility allowance and blind welfare allowance. The legislative basis for the transfer of domiciliary care allowance and blind welfare allowance was included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2008.  The transfer of Mobility Allowance customers will be progressed after the initial transfer has taken place.</p>

            <p eId="para_6118">Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6119">Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.</p>
            <p eId="para_6120">Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the HSE may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent limits.  This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_6121">Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that a person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic SWA rate, less a specified minimum contribution, currently €13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  This minimum contribution which gives clarity to the applicant, as to their contribution to their rent, has not been increased since January 2004, despite significant increases in basic social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_6122">The tenant makes the application for rent supplement and the Department's relationship is with the tenant in all cases.

            <p eId="para_6124">Section 251(1) of Chapter 4 of Part 9 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 states that where a person for the purpose of obtaining or establishing entitlement to payment of any benefit for himself or herself or for any other person, is guilty of an offence where the person</p>

            <p eId="para_6138">Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means, full time care and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if persons applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.  Many applicants for carer's allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6139">The number of claims for carers allowance submitted in 2007 was 18,000 compared to 10,700 in 2006 representing an increase of 68%.   The large increase in applications received is mainly due to the introduction of the half rate carer's allowance payment which came into effect from 27 September 2007.  Approximately 8,900 new applications for Carer's Allowance have been received this year to date. The number of claims decided upon between January and the first week of June this year was 43% higher than in the same period in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_6140">The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands. The available resources are then used to discharge the Department's obligations towards its customers and in implementing cost effective controls to prevent and detect fraud and abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_6141">The Department's Management Services Unit (MSU) monitors available resources against workload on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring optimum processing times for claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_6142">The Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for carer's allowance in light of the current backlog:</p>
            <p eId="para_6143">A review of existing processes and procedures has been undertaken with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_6144">The ongoing staffing requirement was recently reviewed in light of the increased volumes of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_6145">Overtime working is being judiciously applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_6146">It is expected that on foot of the above measures, the number of claims on hand will be reduced in the coming months.  The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.</p>

The private commercial suppliers engaged by the community groups charge the ongoing monitoring costs that usually arise with such alarms. I understand these costs are of the order of €80 per annum per individual, which equates to approximately €1.50 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_6239">Given that the Scheme has benefited in excess of 100,000 older people to date, the cost to my Department of providing funding for all such monitoring costs would be considerable.

            <p eId="para_6251">The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) was launched in May 2004 with provision for 2,500 participant places. On the 18th September 2006 an extra 100 places was provided bringing the total number of places available to 2,600. Once all available places were taken up quotas were assigned to each of the Implementing Bodies (i.e. the LEADER groups and Údarás na Gaeltachta) who manage the scheme at a local level on my Department's behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_6252">While the annual contract period for RSS participants runs from 26th July to the following 25th July, the number of participants on the scheme varies from week to week, therefore I am providing details (please see following tables) of the number of participants on the scheme at year end (31st December) for the period 2004 to 2007 and for week ending 13th June 2008. Data held in respect of the number of participants on the scheme in 2004 and 2005 was only held on an Implementing Body basis.</p>

The scheme does not cover intruder alarms.</p>

            <p eId="para_6474">Ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) were set up under the National Drugs Strategy in 2003 and their areas of operation generally correspond with the Health Board areas as operated at that time.

            <p eId="para_6475">As part of their brief, the RDTFs assessed the nature and extent of the illicit drug problems in their areas of operation and developed action plans for a co-ordinated response to those problems.

            <p eId="para_6572">The 1998 Council of Fisheries Ministers took a decision to ban drift netting for tuna with effect from 1 January 2002.  This decision to ban a particular form of tuna fishing did not amount to the ending of the tuna fishery, however.  For 2008, a quota of 7,958 tonnes of albacore tuna is available to Irish fishermen, which compares favourably with the quota of 3,158 tonnes which prevailed in 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_6573">As part of the package negotiated in 1998, a four-year phase out period was agreed, during which drift netting would be permitted.  Ireland did not submit a conversion plan under Article 1 of Council Decision 1999/27/EC that involved the payment of compensation to those who fished for tuna using drift nets in the past, which was an option available to Member States.  Instead, Ireland secured support for research funding from the Commission to develop alternative fishing techniques through experimental fishing programmes and technology transfers.  The objective of the research initiative was to assist Irish tuna fishermen with converting successfully to other methods following the introduction of the ban on drift netting.  This approach was considered the most appropriate for the Irish fleet.</p>
            <p eId="para_6574">The resulting diversification trials were organised by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  BIM submitted its proposal to conduct research into alternative tuna fishing techniques to the Commission in 1998.  The results of these trials have shown it is possible to catch tuna with techniques other than drift netting.  BIM also provided substantial support to interested fishermen as part of this programme.  Between 1998 and 2002, more than £2 million was invested in helping Irish fishermen make the transition to alternative methods of fishing for tuna.</p>

When the architectural planning process is completed, the progression of the project to tender and construction will be considered in the context of my Department's School Building and modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</p>

        <b>Deputy Frank Feighan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if he is aware that a school (details supplied) in County Leitrim will have 39 pupils in the first class classroom with only one teacher for the school year 2008-2009; the plans he has to divide up classes more evenly; and if he will provide an undertaking to all concerned parents that their fears will be alleviated by giving a commitment that the number of pupils in the classroom will be reduced for the 2008-2009 school year.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6743">Schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and the Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups.  The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6744">Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.  The Department's Inspector will monitor the deployment of staff and class sizes in the school referred to by the Deputy and discuss with the school authority the basis on which school policy decisions in this regard have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_6745">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_6746">The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a Principal and 4 mainstream class teaching posts.  This is based on an enrolment of 120 pupils at 30th September 2006.  The school also secured an additional mainstream class teacher for the 2007/2008 school year under developing school criteria resulting in staffing of Principal and 5 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6747">According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 148 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will be a Principal and 5 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6748">The Board of Management of the school submitted an application seeking the appointment of two additional mainstream class teachers for September 2008 under developing school criteria.  Provisional sanction for the 6th and 7th mainstream class teachers was given by the Primary Payments Section of my Department in a letter to the Chairperson on 1st May 2008 based on a projected enrolment of 163 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_6749">The projected enrolment for September 2008 will be reviewed in October 2008.  It will be necessary for the Board of Management to confirm in writing to Primary Payments Section the actual enrolment achieved in the school on 30th September 2008.  The letter must reach Primary Payments Section within 5 days of 30th September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6750">In the event that the projected enrolment is not reached it is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

            <p eId="para_6755">The agreement reached with Fingal County Council is intended to fast-track the delivery of schools and community facilities throughout Fingal.  Under the terms of the Agreement, Fingal County Council will identify and acquire suitable sites for the Department where schools will be built. In return, the design of the schools on these sites will be varied to meet community needs identified by the Council.  The cost of these community facilities will be met through savings that arise from the difference between the value of the land and the price paid for it — 50% of any savings made in this way will go towards the community facilities and the other 50% will be a saving for the Department.  The schools will benefit from the availability of enhanced facilities as will the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_6756">To date, my Department has, or is currently in the process of acquiring a total of 8 sites in the Fingal County Council administrative area.  The sites in question range in size from c.4 acre sites for primary schools to c.10 acre campus sites for primary and post-primary schools.  However, due to the commercial sensitivities attached to site acquisitions it would not be appropriate for me to provide information on the cost of these sites at the present time.</p>
            <p eId="para_6757">Officials from my Department met recently with Fingal County Council and have agreed a process for determining the valuations and precise amounts that will fall due in respect of each site.  Payments to the Council in respect of these amounts are now being processed and will issue shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_6936">The Schools Public Private Partnership Programme of 4 primary and 23 post primary schools was announced in September 2005. These projects are now progressing through procurement with the 1st Bundle of 4 post primary schools likely to commence construction during 2008. The 2nd Bundle of 6 schools which includes Gaelscoil Bheanntrai, a primary school, was advertised in the European Journal recently.  Work is continuing on identifying the 3rd and 4th bundles of School Projects. A number of schools are being considered for inclusion in these bundles.  On the Third Level programme 17 projects in 9 institutions were announced in November 2005 and I intend that the first bundle of these will be offered to the market this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6937">Generally primary schools are not suitable for the PPP model other than in cases where they can be part of a campus development with a Post Primary School or as part of a larger development as is the case with the inclusion of a primary school on the Grangegorman site. My Department has developed more suitable innovations in the delivery of primary  school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs, use of the Design and Build model and off site construction to ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible.  My Department will continue to use the PPP model as appropriate in order to supplement the programme of school construction under the traditional route.</p>

            <p eId="para_6939">The two Devolved Schemes, the Small Schools Scheme and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme, were originally introduced on a pilot basis for 38 schools in 2003.  Due to the positive feedback from schools, they were extended to cover 699 more schools between the years of 2004 and 2007. The purpose of these devolved schemes are to devolve funding to individual school authorities to undertake refurbishment of existing buildings and/or smaller extensions which will address the school's long term accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6940">Under the terms of the Schemes, school authorities are empowered to manage these works with detailed guidance from, and minimal interaction with, the Department. Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money. Nevertheless, schools are required to meet all design, consultancy and procurement procedures as laid out in my Departments guidelines.  The projects approved for funding under the devolved schemes generally relate to smaller school buildings. It is not considered that the schemes would be suitable for complex major projects such as complete new school buildings.</p>

         asked the

         the involvement of his Department in the creation of a national entrepreneurship policy as recommended in the Small Business Forum report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6950">The Small Business Forum Report placed a particular importance on this topic and recommended that the Government should formally adopt a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement focused on optimising the number of start-up businesses, and in particular, on maximising the number of start-ups aspiring to, and achieving high growth. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is the responsible lead Department for the creation of such a Statement.  My Department has not been involved to date in the creation of this National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement.  I understand that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently finalising this Policy Statement and I would anticipate being consulted on issues relating to entrepreneurship in the education system in the Statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_6951">One of the principles underpinning the Primary School Curriculum is that the child's higher order thinking and problem solving skills are developed. Through the curriculum the child is encouraged to observe, to ask relevant questions, to recognise the essence of a problem, to suggest solutions and to make informed judgements. These skills are fundamental to engendering enterprise in our young people.  At junior cycle, the foundation for enterprise is promoted by ensuring that students follow a broad and balanced programme which features an appropriate mix of skills, including communications, personal effectiveness, ICT, languages, and a range of academic and vocational options.</p>
            <p eId="para_6952">In senior cycle students taking the Transition Year option, the Leaving Certificate Vocational programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied are provided with specific opportunities to acquire enterprise skills. These programmes place a strong focus on action learning, community-based approaches, personal development and teamwork. Students also engage in work experience. Typically, Transition Year students engage in mini-company activities whereby they plan, develop and manage a mini enterprise or organise a major event such as a trade fair or fashion show. Teamwork, multi-disciplinary learning, interpersonal and communications skills, planning, evaluation, and mastery of business concepts are all part of this process. Approximately, 28,000 students take the Transition Year annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_6953">The Link Modules within the Leaving Certificate Vocational programme comprise Enterprise Education and Preparation for the World of Work. These are assessed as part of the certificate examinations and the results can be used for CAO points purposes. In 2007, the Link Modules were taken by 14,080 candidates.  The Tasks carried out by students taking the Leaving Certificate Applied to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they have acquired are also assessed as part of the certificate examinations, and 3,056 students sat the Leaving certificate Applied in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_6954">The Leaving Certificate Business syllabus has a strong focus on enterprise. The syllabus covers marketing and starting a business, the domestic and international environment, handling conflict, enterprise skills and their application to different situations. In 2007, Leaving Certificate Business was taken by 18,957 candidates.</p>

         asked the

         the occasions on which his Department has carried out a screening regulatory impact analysis on statutory instruments, Bills and EU directives in the years 2006, 2007 and to date in 2008; the occasions on which it has subsequently decided not to carry out a full regulatory impact analysis; the reason this decision was made in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_925">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6956">On the 21st June 2005 the Government decided that Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) should be introduced across all Government Departments and Offices. RIAs must be conducted on:</p>
            <p eId="para_6957">1. all proposals for primary legislation involving changes to the regulatory framework (subject to some exceptions)</p>
            <p eId="para_6958">2. significant Statutory Instruments</p>
            <p eId="para_6959">3. proposals for EU Directives and significant EU regulations when they are published by the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_6960">Screening Regulatory Impact Analysis has been carried out by my Department on three occasion in the years 2006, 2007 and 2008.   The analyses in question were in respect of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007, the Student Support Bill 2008 and the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (Directive 2005/36/EC) Regulations 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6961">However, the purpose of a screening RIA is not solely to determine whether a full RIA is necessary but rather to determine whether there are significant impacts which would require further consultation and more detailed analysis. In accordance with best practice, a full RIA would be conducted by the Department where the Screening RIA indicates that any one or more of the following would apply:</p>
            <p eId="para_6962">1.  There will be significant negative impacts upon national competitiveness;</p>
            <p eId="para_6963">2.  There will be significant negative impacts on the socially excluded, or on vulnerable groups;</p>
            <p eId="para_6964">3.  There will be significant environmental damage;</p>
            <p eId="para_6965">4.  The proposals involve a significant policy change in an economic market or will have a significant impact on competition or consumers;</p>
            <p eId="para_6966">5.  The proposals will disproportionately impinge on the rights of citizens;</p>
            <p eId="para_6967">6.  The proposals will impose a disproportionate compliance burden;</p>
            <p eId="para_6968">7.  The costs to the Exchequer or third parties are significant, or are disproportionately borne by one group or sector. (Initial costs of € 10 million or cumulative costs of € 50 million over 10 years — to include both costs to the Exchequer and third parties — would be considered significant in this context).</p>
            <p eId="para_6969">As the Deputy will note, one of the Screening RIAs was conducted in relation to the transposition of a Directive which had been agreed prior to the advent of RIA and thus an ex-ante approach to the application of RIA to the matters giving rise to these regulations would not have been possible.  In the case of the remaining two RIAs, the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007 and the Student Support Bill 2008, both had their origins in a series of expert reports.   The Student Support Bill 2008 arose as a consequence of the recommendations of a series of reports in respect of which extensive consultation took place with the educational partners over a considerable period of time, i.e. the Report of the Advisory Committee on Third-level Student Support (the de Buitleir Report, 1993), the Report of the Action Group on Access to Third-level Education (MacNamara, 2001) and Supporting Equity in Higher Education (2003) were such as to have framed the context within which the proposals for legislation would proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6970">It may also be noted that the Student Support Bill 2008 proposed a reduction in the number of awarding authorities, and therefore in light of the fact that no significant additional costs or impacts would arise, it was not considered necessary to carry out a full RIA. The key elements of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007 arose on foot of the need to give effect to the Report of the Taskforce on Student Behaviour, ("School Matters", March 2006), a report which considered more than 150 submissions from various parties, and for which ultimately the legislative amendments would not give rise to any additional compliance burden and therefore it was decided not to proceed with a full RIA in this case either.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6988">The Deputy will be aware of this Government's commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum with the option, in line with each child's ability, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_6989">My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs to be integrated into mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. This does not necessarily mean that every child needs to be fully integrated. Some children may be better supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_6990">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was set up to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children. The Council, with its network of up to 80 Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is providing a structure for the delivery of an effective and speedy education service to children and families coping with disability on a daily basis. Working locally on the ground, the SENOs are a focal point of contact for parents and schools.  Parents can contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, including any issues or queries they may have in relation to the integration of their child into mainstream education, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_6991">The SENOs are responsible for ensuring that all special educational needs in their areas are addressed in an effective manner. They are charged with facilitating access to, and co-ordinating education services for children with special needs in their areas. They will do this by liaising between local providers of educational services, appropriate ancillary services, the council, the Department and parents.  There are now over 19,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs. This includes almost 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) — compared with just 300 in 1997. There are also over 7,800 resource and learning support teachers — compared with about 2,000 in 1998. More than 1,100 other teachers support children in our special schools, while hundreds more work in special classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6992">As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment. Schools are therefore being supported to enable them to cater for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6993">The Deputy will be aware that it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils, including pupils with special educational needs, seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_6994">Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>
            <p eId="para_6995">The Deputy may be aware that my Department recently published a report of a major audit of school enrolment practice. The purpose of the audit, conducted by my Department's Regional Office Service, was to examine the disparities that exist in schools in particular locations in relation to the numbers of pupils enrolled who are newcomers, have special educational needs or are from the Traveller community. Over half the primary and second level schools in the country were surveyed under the audit.</p>
            <p eId="para_6996">I should emphasise that the statistical information presented requires cautious interpretation, particularly in the context of local factors that could be identified in many instances at primary level (e.g. a concentration of newcomer or traveller children living in a particular area impacting on enrolment in the nearest school).  When interpreted in that context, the statistical information returned does not point to enrolment problems on a system wide scale. It does, however, identify a number of school clusters where the evidence points to some schools assuming more responsibility for enrolling children of all backgrounds and needs within their local community, than others.</p>
            <p eId="para_6997">In order to ensure that no schools are directly identified and to ensure that "league tables" for particular areas could not be formed, the published information excludes the names and addresses of schools, but groups them within geographical clusters for comparison purposes. My predecessor has written to the main partners in education setting out some areas for consideration in order to facilitate an informed consultation with the education partners about possible policy measures available to ensure that all schools are welcoming and inclusive to all children of all needs in their own local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_6998">Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that I will host a Conference on the Governance Challenge for Future School Needs on 27th June 2008 in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham to consider the implications of new societal diversity on the future organisation of primary schools. It will be an opportunity for each of the main patron bodies to outline their vision of how the system needs to collectively evolve to respond to the changing circumstances.  The Conference will focus on the particular challenges of ethos and inclusion for patron bodies, under both the new and existing patronage models, in ensuring that the system is appropriately attuned to future demands. The long term challenges of organising and developing our system of school governance to accommodate new parental demands and aspirations will be subject to consideration. The Conference will also deal with issues of capacity, choice, ensuring inclusion and the implications for enrolment policies.</p>

            <p eId="para_7000">The school to which the Deputy refers has applied to my Department for capital funding for an extension project.  The development of a building project for the school is at an early stage, and requires a technical visit to progress matters. As the Deputy will be aware, all applications for capital funding are prioritised and advanced incrementally by my Department.  This applies to the progression of all preparatory work leading up to the construction phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_7001">The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  The project for the school in question carries a Band 2.2 rating.</p>
            <p eId="para_7002">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered on an on-going basis in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department and with the level of activity in the School Building Programme, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the project at this time.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Department must, in the first instance, manage its resources to ensure that the projects which are in the programme are delivered.  My Department will be arranging a site visit for the school in question as and when resources allow and when the project is ready to progress through the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_7037">My Department offers 50 Third Level Scholarships annually for students from all-Irish schools under three scholarship schemes as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_7038">Scéim Scoláireachtaí Triú Leibhéal do Mhic Léinn Ón nGaeltacht</p>
            <p eId="para_7039">Scéim Scoláireachtaí Triú Leibhéal (Trí Ghaeilge Teoranta)</p>
            <p eId="para_7040">Scéim Scoláireachtaí Ghaeilge Triú Leibhéil (Neamh-Theoranta)</p>
            <p eId="para_7041">These scholarships are awarded to those students who have, among other things, attended an all-Irish second level school and reached a certain minimum standard in the Leaving Certificate Examination.  These scholarships are only tenable in respect of specified third level courses.  Applications are required for these scholarships.</p>
            <p eId="para_7042">My Department also operates a number of other scholarship schemes with different criteria, requirements and objectives.  For example, it awards seven Easter Week Commemoration Scholarships annually on the basis of the Leaving Certificate results.  An Easter Week Commemoration Scholarship is a highly prestigious award as only one scholarship is awarded annually in commemoration of each signatory of the 1916 Proclamation of Independence.  Sixteen Donogh O'Malley Scholarships are awarded to the top-performing Leaving Certificate students in DEIS schools — these students must also meet certain socio-economic criteria to qualify for this scholarship.</p>
            <p eId="para_7043">Clearly, it is appropriate that there should be different terms and conditions pertaining to each of the scholarship schemes.  There are no plans at present to depart from the current arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_7061">The full time Education Centre based in Donegal Town has been allocated an amount of €151,812 for 2008.  In addition to this the part time Education Centre based in Gortahork has been allocated an amount of €8,889 for 2008.  The allocation for the part time centre is administered through Donegal Education Centre and is kept separate from the allocation for the full time centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_7062">Following a review of the funding model for part time centres in 2006 it was decided that all funding for part time centres should be administered through the full time Education Centre in their catchment area.  Prior to this, part time centres administered their own accounts and budgeting.  The impetus and rationale for the introduction of the revised funding model was to promote greater cohesion in the Education Centre Network in the context of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) provision and to ensure equality of access to teachers on a regional basis to CPD opportunities.  My Department considered Directors of part-time centres to be ideally placed to identify the CPD needs of teachers in their catchments.  In alleviating Directors of the administrative and often cumbersome tasks associated with managing a centre, the efforts of the Directors of part-time centres could be more appropriately concentrated on the core objectives of the centre and the Network.  In addition to this and mindful of the Department's obligations to the Official Languages Act it was decided to appoint a part time administrator to the three full time Education Centres whose catchment area encompasses the three part time teacher education centres.  One of these Centres is Donegal and they have received sanction to appoint such an administrator.</p>

            <p eId="para_7070">The school originally applied to my Department for capital funding for a PE Hall.  It subsequently submitted a revised application to include additional classroom accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_7071">As the Deputy is aware, all applications for large scale capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_7072">Under the criteria, each project is assigned a Band Rating which reflects the type of works required and the urgency attaching to them.  Band Ratings do not reflect the length of time an application is in the system because, such an approach could lead to a situation where lower priority projects could absorb the funding available, thereby preventing higher priority projects from being delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_7073">The length of time a project is in the system may be used as a means, however, to select within Bands when this is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_7074">There are four Band Ratings in all with Band 1 being the highest and Band 4 the lowest.  A Band 2 rating has been assigned to the project in question which reflects the fact that the school has a deficit of mainstream accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_7075">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, will be considered on an on-going basis in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

            <p eId="para_7077">It is understood that the question refers to 2 Primary schools and 1 Post Primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_7078">In the region of €800 million will be spent by my Department this year on tackling educational disadvantage at all levels — from pre-school to further and higher education.  This represents an increase of nearly €70 million on the comparable 2007 figure and is testament to the Government's determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure that all our children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school.  Social inclusion measures across all Government departments have also been prioritised under the Towards 2016 agreement, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16 and the National Development Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_7079">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  As a result of the identification and review processes, 873 schools have been included in the new School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS.  These comprise 670 primary schools (urban and rural) and 203 second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7080">The 3 schools referred to by the Deputy have been identified for inclusion in the programme which is being rolled out on a phased basis over the period to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_7081">Measures to be in place in participating schools on full implementation of DEIS range from: Early Childhood Education Provision; Reduced class sizes in primary schools of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes; Allocation of administrative principals in primary schools on lower enrolment and staffing figures than apply in primary schools generally; Additional non-pay/capitation allocation based on level of disadvantage; Additional funding under School Books Grant Scheme; Access to Schools Meals Programme; Access to Home Schools Community Liaison services; Access to range of supports based on best practice of School Completion Programme; Access to literacy/numeracy support service to specific literacy/numeracy measures; Access to transfer programmes; Access to planning supports; Access to a range of professional development supports; Eligibility for teachers/principals to apply for sabbatical leave scheme; Enhanced guidance counselling provision for post primary schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage; Provision for school library and librarian supports for post primary schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage and Access to Junior Certificate School Programme and Leaving Certificate Applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_7082">In the current school year, grants totalling almost €19 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds under DEIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_7083">These additional financial supports allocated to each of the schools selected under DEIS provides for the inclusion of after school and holiday time support — for literacy and numeracy development as well as homework support, social and personal development and arts activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_7084">In addition the 3 schools referred to by the Deputy were also eligible to apply for various once off dormant account funding schemes.

         if he will increase the student representation of the Higher Education Authority and the NQAI; his views on whether the greater the student voice the more democratic these bodies are and the more reflective they are in the needs of students and the education system as a whole; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7092">The commitment under the Programme for Government to appoint a further student representative to the HEA can be accommodated under existing legislation and will be considered when future vacancies arise.  The HEA engages extensively with student interests as an integral part of its work.  The USI plays an active role in this process and continues to ably represent its constituency.</p>
            <p eId="para_7093">The composition of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland is set out in Section 6 of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, and provides for one representative of learners. The Authority is committed to working in a participative manner and engages extensively with student and other stakeholder interests as an integral part of its work, through a variety of consultative fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_7094">I do not accept that democratic and participative working depends on high volumes of membership on boards.  Under Section 8 of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, there is a legal requirement on the Authority, in carrying out its functions to consult with representatives of learners and other interests.  In addition, the publication Policies and Criteria for the establishment of the National Framework of Qualifications (October 2003) commits the Authority to core values of Equality and Accessibility, Transparency and Simplicity, and to Consultation and Inclusiveness in its ongoing work. This is seen as essential to secure ownership and successful implementation of the framework and in line with best management practice in ensuring the centrality of the learner in the overall system.</p>

            <p eId="para_7108">Over 75% of pupils are in classes of less than 30 pupils.  Preliminary indications from my Department's analysis of statistical returns from schools for the current school year appear to indicate that there has been a drop in the numbers of pupils in classes of over 30 pupils.  The analysis of all the returns from schools has yet to be completed and the final outcome will be published later in the summer.  The information in respect of the previous years is shown in the table<b>.</b>  With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes. </p>
            <p eId="para_7109">The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_7110">The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_7111">Budget 2008 provided my Department with €4.6 billion or €380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions.  This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based.  That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last Summer.  It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.</p>
            <p eId="para_7112">This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.</p>
            <p eId="para_7113">All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to class size are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management.  Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment all things considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_7131">Schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and the Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_7132">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7133">Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_7134">Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 319 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 12 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_7135">According to data submitted by the Board of Management the enrolment on 30th September 2007 was 326 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is also available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will remain at a Principal and 12 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_7136">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_7137">It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_7138">The first meeting of the Appeal Board took place on 20th May, 2008. Further meetings will be held in June and October, 2008.  The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 20 June and 10 October respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

            <p eId="para_7150">The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1969 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_7151">An approved course for the purposes of the Grants Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one-year duration pursued in an approved third-level institution. The institutions approved under the Scheme, are, generally speaking, publicly funded third level colleges offering full-time courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level.</p>
            <p eId="para_7152">Similarly under the terms of the Free Fees Initiative, whereby the State meets the tuition costs of eligible students, an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of a minimum duration of two years in an approved third level institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_7153">Courses pursued by means of distance education are not approved courses under the terms of the Maintenance Grant Schemes or the Free Fees Initiative as they are not considered to be full-time courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_7154">However, Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and postgraduate courses in non-EU countries. Tax relief at undergraduate level extends to approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges in the State and any other EU Member State and approved full/part-time courses operated by Colleges in any EU Member State providing distance education in the State. Approved undergraduate courses must be of at least two years duration, and both the college and the course must satisfy the Codes of Standards as laid down by my Department. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the candidate's local Tax Office.</p>

The Council, with its network of up to 80 Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is providing a structure for the delivery of an effective and speedy education service to children and families coping with disability on a daily basis. Working locally on the ground, the SENOs are a focal point of contact for parents and schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7161">A specific function of the Council through its network of local SENOs, is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.

Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_7170">I propose to take Questions Nos. 700 to 702, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7171">I can assure the Deputy that the safety of children travelling on the school transport service is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme. In recent years, a range of measures to enhance safety and to improve the quality of the school transport service has been put in place, both in the vicinity of and on board school buses. These measures include the phasing out of the 3 for 2 seating arrangement on both primary and post primary services and providing all children with an individual seat equipped with a seat belt.</p>
            <p eId="para_7172">Bus Éireann also has a wide range of checking procedures in place, in addition to the statutory vehicle examinations, to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, that a safe and reliable service is delivered. These procedures are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that appropriate standards are maintained and improved upon, where possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_7173">All vehicles operating under the School Transport Scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of Transport. Vehicles with more than eight adult seats and which are more than one year old are required to pass the Department of Transport's annual roadworthiness test.</p>
            <p eId="para_7174">Private operators employed by Bus Éireann, under the school transport scheme, are contractually obliged to keep their nominated vehicles in a safe and roadworthy condition at all times. These contractors are required to meet an extensive range of regulations and standards as set out by the Department of Transport for use of buses in public places.</p>
            <p eId="para_7175">In addition, Bus Éireann's mobile School Transport Inspectors carry out service checks on the performance of some 6,000 routes provided under the scheme, throughout the year. During this check the Inspector conducts an on-board inspection of the vehicle to ensure that the vehicle and driver are as nominated, and to check that other safety requirements are being observed. Follow up action is taken by the local Bus Éireann office, which can include termination of contract, if deficiencies are detected. Since 2004 some 2,000 warnings have been issued in relation to matters in this regard by Bus Éireann School Transport Offices. The contracts to provide 37 school transport services were terminated during this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_7176">Furthermore, in 2006 Bus Éireann introduced a system of individual vehicle audits and maintenance system audits, conducted by leading international experts in this field. In the course of these examinations, which serve as an enhanced safety mechanism in addition to statutory obligations, and which include both Bus Éireann and Contractors' buses, a wide range of items on the bus are examined. Depending on the nature of a possible defect an advisory may be issued or more immediate action may be flagged. Corrective action may be found necessary on items including, but not limited to, repairs to seat belts, lights, fittings, oil leaks, valves, emergency door buzzers, wiring and other items.</p>
            <p eId="para_7177">A total of 72 vehicles were inspected in 2006. In 2007, 136 vehicles have been audited. This process is ongoing and the intention is that 5% of the School Transport Contractors Bus Fleet will be examined annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_7178">Bus Éireann has issued a circular to parents of children travelling on school transport, inviting their co-operation, and that of their children, to help make the school transport journey as safe and comfortable as possible. The circular emphasises the importance of safety, the consequences of misbehaviour and the disciplinary measures which may be necessary.</p>

It advanced Chemistry, which is sat by some 7000 students, and Geography, sat by some 25,000 students, to Thursday and Friday respectively of the first week, which, with Home Economics which is sat by some 12,000 students, ensures that the majority of students get a break of at least one half day during this intensive phase.

            <p eId="para_7209">The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_7210">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_7211">Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</p>
            <p eId="para_7212">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

            <p eId="para_7216">The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_7217">My Department's child centred policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism; NEPS; the Inspectorate; an analysis of research including that supplied by the IAA; and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.  Advice was sought from international experts on research provided by the Irish Autism Action group and other research on educational interventions for children with autistic spectrum disorders and it is clear that this research does not support the exclusive usage of ABA or indeed the exclusive use of any other approach, as a basis for national educational provision for ASD children. It is for this reason that the Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs. It is also important to bear in mind that school-based provision is being put in place throughout the country that will be in a position to provide for future cohorts of children and respond to their individual needs. My Department remains willing to review and consider any further research as and when it becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_7218">The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 315 classes have now been approved around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_7219">The Deputy will be aware that children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, TEACCH and PECS. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</p>

It is open to the parents to submit an application to my Department for Home Tuition Grant as an interim arrangement until a suitable educational placement has been sourced.

I understand that the local SENO notified the school on 16th June 2008 that there will be no staffing allocated to this class for September 2008.</p>

In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_7281">Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.  A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality.  In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_7291">I propose to take Questions Nos. 743, 764 and 765 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7292">Youthreach is designed to offer two years integrated education, training and work experience for young people aged 15 — 20 who have left school early without achieving qualifications. The programme, which is managed by VECs at local level, is available in 100 centres nationally and caters for almost 3,700 learners.</p>
            <p eId="para_7293">Supports available to students in Post Primary Schools do not transfer with the student to Youthreach centres.  To address special educational needs and provide the necessary supports for learners in Youthreach centres, my Department introduced the Special Education Needs Initiative (SENI) in 2007. The SENI was introduced to 25 groups of 25 learners across 20 Youthreach centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_7294">The SENI involves a general allocation model similar to that introduced in the primary sector in September 2005.  It is team based and caters mainly for students with high incidence needs. The SENI provides for the allocation of increased staffing hours (from 4,200 to 5,700 hours per group per year) to deal with the special needs and disabilities of all the students.</p>
            <p eId="para_7295">Additional training was provided to staff in the centres to enable the introduction, on a centre team basis, of a range of professional practices to support students with special educational needs/disabilities.  This training followed on from the national introductory training programme introduced into all centres in 2006.  In addition, the 20 centres have access to a password protected internet site containing guidelines, tailored training programmes and other materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_7296">During 2007, an evaluation was carried out on the SENI to determine its suitability and effectiveness for the learners. The findings of this evaluation were generally positive and found the new initiative to be meeting the needs of learners.  The evaluation recommended full integration of the SENI into each centre. My Department is currently examining the possibility of rolling out the SENI to other Youthreach centres, subject to the availability of funding.</p>

        <b>Deputy Jack Wall</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the facilities and assistance available to students progressing from primary to secondary schools (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_7298">The National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_7299">There is no automatic system of transfer of resources from one school to another. Where a child with special educational needs (SEN) is in receipt of additional supports in a school and moves school or moves on to post-primary, and no other child with special needs enrols in the school, then the resource — resource teaching hours and/or special needs assistant support — is withdrawn from the first school and, if still warranted by the child's needs, is sanctioned for the new school. In considering applications for teaching and SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the needs identified in the professional report and decide whether the circumstances come within the Department's criteria. They then consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupil from its current level of resources. A child needing occasional assistance with toileting may, for example, only require a limited amount of an SNA's time which may be available within the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_7300">As the Deputy may be aware, SNA support in schools is intended to address the care needs of pupils with special educational needs. The criteria for the provision of SNA support envisages that such support is sanctioned where a child has a significant medical need, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where the child is a danger to themselves or other pupils. It would be expected that very often this level of care should diminish as the child matures and consequently the level of SNA support required in the school will diminish also.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_7310">I propose to take Questions Nos. 748 and 749 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7311">The specific information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. However, the Deputy can be assured that my Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities for all pupils attending schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7312">My Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision of PE Halls, general-purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. PE facilities have been provided, where appropriate, as part of my Department's school building programme which, between 2000 and 2006, involved the delivery of over 7,800 projects, with an investment of €2.6 billion and a further €4.5 billion is to be invested under the new National Development Plan 2007-2013. Close to €600m of this will be provided this year alone. This multi-annual funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation including PE facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_7313">The PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general-purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the PE programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools. The recommended minimum timeframe set out for PE at primary level is one hour per week. All qualified Primary teachers are qualified to teach the full spectrum of the Primary Curriculum including Physical Education.</p>
            <p eId="para_7314">Primary schools received €2000 each in PE equipment grants in 2006, at a total cost of €6.5 million. A similar grant of €4,000 per school, at an overall cost of around €3 million, issued to post-primary schools in 2007. In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Such materials and equipment would normally have a useful life of several years.</p>
            <p eId="para_7315">The extent and quality of local sports facilities has been improved dramatically in recent years, with more than €450 million invested by the Government since 1998 in over 5,000 projects through the Sports Capital Programme.  This is in addition to the PE, general purpose and outdoor play facilities that have been provided for schools all over the country through the School Building Programme, as outlined above.</p>
            <p eId="para_7316">The Government recognises that there is a lack of recreational facilities for community use in certain areas which could be met if school premises were made available to the wider community. To encourage schools in this respect, my Department issued a circular to all school authorities in late 2005 urging trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community education and recreation purposes. Decisions in relation to the use of school facilities remain entirely at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending the school are prioritised in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_7317">So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, the Government is working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed, the 'State of the Nation's Children' report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</p>

            <p eId="para_7319">In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second-level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable. The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_7320">A revised syllabus in Physical Education as a non-examinable subject at Junior Cycle was introduced in post-primary schools in September 2003 and implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2005. No implementation dates have been set as yet for further reforms in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_7321">Curriculum support services provide training and school-based support for teachers. School-based support is a very rich form of support and allows the teacher explore the possibilities and limitations of the environment in which they teach. Through modelling of lessons and professional dialogue, the quality of teaching is enhanced and teachers are further enabled to develop their teaching skills. Teachers must also aim to include all students in PE lessons — irrespective of gender, or physical and/or learning deficits. The PE Association of Ireland have been active in organising conferences where teachers can avail of an opportunity to witness the latest thinking in physical education, and my Department also funds programmes on PE through the network of education centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_7322">This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities. In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design. Between 2000 and 2006 a total of 516 large-scale projects were delivered in primary and post-primary schools by my Department as part of a record overall investment of €2.6 billion in modernising primary and post-primary school facilities throughout the country. Many more large-scale projects are under construction or due to go to construction in the near future. New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7323">A special PE funding package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools in 2007, providing a grant of €4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment. This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_7324">So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed, the 'State of the Nation's Children' report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.</p>

The position is that the Institutes of Technology are autonomous institutions and my Department does not have any function in their day-to-day operational affairs. The Institutes receive a block grant from the Higher Education Authority and it is a matter for each institution to determine how it is allocated internally.   In the case of the Cork School of Music, it is a matter for Cork Institute of Technology to determine the level of funding to be allocated to the School, and I have no role in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_7328">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7329">Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 382 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 14 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_7330">According to data submitted by the Board of Management the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 388 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is also available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will remain a Principal and 14 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_7331">The school also has the services of 3 Learning Support/Resource Teachers and 1 Resource Teacher for Special Needs Pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_7332">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_7333">It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_7334">The staffing of the school for the 2008/2009 school year was considered by the Appeal Board on 20 May 2008. The Board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in Circular 0024/2007, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_7335">The Board of Management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the Appeal Board on 22 May 2008.</p>

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 349 of 27 May 2008, if his attention has been drawn to cases where his Department, through the home tuition scheme provided grants to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons were unable to attend school and where the teachers who had been engaged by the parents had not been paid as agreed out of moneys provided by his Department under the scheme; the action he has taken or will take in such events; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7337">The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment on individual cases in respect of home tuition payments. However, the home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting an educational placement and provide early education intervention for pre-school children with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_7338">Parents engage tutors directly and the grant is paid to the parent on a monthly basis in arrears.  In such instances the payment is made to the parent, who is then responsible for payment to their selected tutor. This affords a degree of flexibility and choice for parents in selecting the most suitable tutor for the purposes of home tuition for their children. However, where the teacher is a serving primary teacher and already being paid through the teachers' payroll, my Department, if so advised by the parent, may process the payment directly through the teachers' payroll system.</p>

The Civil Defence Board, which was established on 7 May 2003 under the Civil Defence Act 2002, has responsibility for the management and development of the Civil Defence organisation at national level.  Coiste an Asgard was established in 1968 and was incorporated under the Companies Acts on 16 February 1987.  The basic purpose of an Coiste is to promote the training of young people over the age of 16 in sailing and seamanship, particularly by the use of the sail-training vessel Asgard II.</p>
            <p eId="para_7447">The Army Pensions Board was established as an independent statutory body under the Army Pensions Act 1927.  The principal function of the Board is to investigate applications for pensions, allowances and gratuities arising from the death or disablement of members of the Defence Forces in the course of their military service.  The Board determines the question of attributability to service, assesses the degree of disability in cases of disablement and reports its findings to the Minister for Defence.</p>

            <p eId="para_7456">Members of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) who are injured in the course of their duties may apply for compensation under a non-statutory compensation scheme administered by my Department.  Typically, this would cover injuries sustained on official duty while participating in annual camp, field days, overnights, exercises, parades and courses of instruction.  Compensation is payable under the scheme where it is established that a member of the RDF has been disabled as the result of injuries sustained in the course of his or her duties.  However, no compensation is payable where injury or death is caused by the member's own serious negligence or misconduct, or where alternative compensation is otherwise received for the same injury. The scheme does not extend to training injuries sustained in their own time outside periods of military activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_7461">I am advised that the disposal of obsolete military equipment takes place on an ongoing basis as the need arises.  The disposal of such equipment usually follows from the recommendation from a military Board of Survey, which confirms that the equipment is of no further value to the Defence Forces.  In the majority of cases old but operable weaponry is decommissioned by members of the Defence Forces under the direction of the Ordnance Corps.  One such case was the decommissioning of mortars in 1999.  The mortars were converted to scrap in Clancy Barracks and were then removed to the former Irish Steel plant in Haulbowline, County Cork in October that year for reprocessing.</p>

            <p eId="para_7504">My Office does not administer any grant scheme which specifically facilitates the provision of assistance for integration media material.  My Office does, however, provide a scheme of grants to small and local organisations which are active in the area of integration or befriending of migrants.  Notice of these small grants were advertised earlier this year with applications invited by the 29th February, 2008.  Work is currently being undertaken to make initial payments to those applicants who were successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_7505">My Office is also the Responsible Authority for the European Refugee Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals, known as the European Integration Fund.  The administration of these Funds is being undertaken by Pobal on behalf of my Office.  Pobal invited applications for integration projects from interested organisations with a closing date of 28th January, 2008.  Recently all applicants, both successful and unsuccessful, were notified of the outcome of their applications and currently preparations are being made for the signing of contracts and the issuing of initial payments.  The next round of these funds will be advertised in the latter part of this year or early in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7506">In addition to the above sources of funding, Pobal is also administering, on my behalf, a fund for initiatives to support the integration of legally resident immigrants.  In the latest round of this, the successful applicants received their grants last October and their projects are ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_7512">Ireland was in the first group of countries to sign, subject to ratification, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities when it opened for signature on 30 March 2007.  A high-level, cross-departmental implementation group was established in 2007 to advise on any changes to the Government's National Disability Strategy that may be required to enable the State ratify the Convention.  This group has developed a work programme setting out the matters that need to be aligned with the UN Convention in order that ratification may take place, and this work programme is being actively addressed by Government Departments.  It is the Government's intention that the Convention will be ratified by Ireland as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary requirements under the Convention are being met.</p>

            <p eId="para_7529">The establishment of a dedicated Office for Internet Safety (OIS) is an important step in the process of building the best possible protection for the community at large and in particular for children from the downside of the internet.

Under the terms of the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003, staff appointed on temporary contracts, must be treated as ‘comparable permanent employees' for the purpose of pay and incremental progression.

Training needs are met by attendance at formal training courses, on the job training and self learning. Training to meet formal business needs/job specific training is delivered either by the in-house training team or by external trainers including the UNHCR. Training in respect of competency and personal development  is delivered through attendance at formal training courses, conferences and seminars.

            <p eId="para_7571">In relation to the provision of interpretation services in the asylum determination process, the sole purpose of the use of an interpreter at asylum interviews is to enable efficient and effective communication between the asylum applicant and the interviewing officer and to ensure that the asylum applicant has a full opportunity to put forward his or her case. Interpreters are obliged to provide true and accurate translations of the questions asked and the answers given. They must observe absolute impartiality, advise of any conflict of interest arising and observe a comprehensive duty of confidence in relation to any information obtained in the course of their duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_7572">The sourcing of interpreters for asylum interviews is arranged through an interpretation service provider as needs arise. This service is provided under the terms of a contract for interpretation services between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the company concerned, following an EU wide tender competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_7573">Under the provisions of the contract, the service provider is responsible for the selection of the interpreters and for ensuring the competency and proficiency in both English and the language / dialect required of the interpreters.

            <p eId="para_7574">While it is not possible to comment on the internal training provided by the interpretation service provider to their staff, I am advised that UNHCR has provided training to interpreters in the past in relation to interpreting with regard to the asylum process. ORAC also regularly monitors the standard and quality of service provided by its interpretation suppliers through its internal quality assurance systems and by having regular meetings with the manager of the relevant company to ensure that the interpreters are professional in the course of their duty. The ORAC has developed guidelines relating to the use of interpretation in the ORAC in consultation with UNHCR.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_7603">Prosecutions relating to street begging have generally been brought under section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Ireland Act 1847. However, the Deputy may be aware that in its  judgement in March 2007 in the case of Niall Dillon -v- The DPP the High Court found that section to be unconstitutional. The reasoned judgement was delivered in December 2007.  In its judgement, the High Court found that section 3 was unconstitutional on the basis that it was too vague and unspecific and that the constitutional right to free expression and communication was being unreasonably curtailed.  Following receipt of legal advice, my predecessor decided not to appeal the judgement.</p>
            <p eId="para_7604">As a result of the Dillon judgment the law in relation to the circumstances in which prosecutions may be brought for street begging is not entirely clear. However, a number of statutory provisions continue to apply.  For example, individuals who engage in begging in a public place in a manner likely to cause fear or annoyance or who obstruct the free passage of, or harass any person, or who fail to comply with the direction of a Garda are liable to prosecution under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 or the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 for obstruction, disorderly conduct, harassment etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_7605">I would also emphasise that the High Court's judgement in Dillon does not affect the operation of section 247 of the Children Act 2001, under which anyone who procures or has charge of a child for the purposes of begging is guilty of an offence.  My Department is examining the High Court judgement with a view to bringing forward new legislative proposals in relation to begging that will set the law in a more current context.</p>
            <p eId="para_7606">In relation to the number of arrests and prosecutions in Dublin for begging in recent years, the Deputy may be aware that following the submission of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. The CSO has published crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006. In addition, the CSO has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_7608">I am advised by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) that 53 civil servants are at present involved in interviewing and making recommendations on applications for refugee status. Other staff in ORAC provide support functions in the asylum area including dealing with cases under the EU Dublin Regulation determining the Member State responsible for processing asylum applications, family reunification functions, information technology support, reception duties in the applications centre and presentation work before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_7609">There are no staff employed on a case by case basis in ORAC, however, six of the above staff are employed on contracts of indefinite duration. Under the terms of the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003, staff appointed on temporary contracts must be treated as "comparable permanent employees" for the purpose of pay and incremental progression. The remainder of staff are permanent employees.  Staff working in the Office satisfy the qualifications criteria relevant to the civil service grade to which they are appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_7610">A comprehensive training programme is provided to staff who are assigned to work in the area of Refugee Status Determination (RSD) as well as ongoing training. Training programmes are provided by a combination of ORAC's in-house training team and outside experts including UNHCR.</p>
            <p eId="para_7611">As well as general training, the staff working in the RSD case processing area are provided with training on a wide variety of issues which arise in refugee status determination. These include gender based matters, dealing with traumatised applicants, the use of Country of Origin information and interview techniques. In addition, training and guidance is provided to both new and experienced caseworkers on issues such as the meaning of persecution, the internal protection alternative, agents of persecution, dual nationality, credibility and the use of and reliance on identity documentation.</p>
            <p eId="para_7612">Finally, training is also provided to sensitively deal with vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied minors and victims of sexual violence. The latter is provided by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_7613">In relation to the provision of interpretation services in the asylum determination process, the sole purpose of the use of an interpreter at asylum interviews is to enable efficient and effective communication between the asylum applicant and the interviewing officer and to ensure that the asylum applicant has a full opportunity to put forward his or her case. Interpreters are obliged to provide true and accurate translations of the questions asked and the answers given. They must observe absolute impartiality, advise of any conflict of interest arising and observe a comprehensive duty of confidence in relation to any information obtained in the course of their duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_7614">The sourcing of interpreters for asylum interviews is arranged through an interpretation service provider as needs arise. This service is provided under the terms of a contract for interpretation services between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the company concerned, following an EU wide tender competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_7615">Under the provisions of the contract, the service provider is responsible for the selection of the interpreters and for ensuring the competency and proficiency in both English and the language / dialect required of the interpreters. The interpreters are required to have undergone training on the asylum process, arranged by the interpretation company.</p>
            <p eId="para_7616">While it is not possible to comment on the internal training provided by the interpretation service provider to their staff, I am advised that UNHCR has provided training to interpreters in the past in relation to interpreting with regard to the asylum process. ORAC also regularly monitors the standard and quality of service provided by its interpretation suppliers through its internal quality assurance systems and by having regular meetings with the manager of the relevant company to ensure that the interpreters are professional in the course of their duty. The ORAC has developed guidelines relating to the use of interpretation in the ORAC in consultation with UNHCR.</p>

            <p eId="para_7670">I am advised by officials in the long term residency section of my Department that long term residency is an administrative scheme introduced in May 2004 and is focused on persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit / work authorisation / work visa conditions.  Such persons may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_7671">The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants. Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_7672">While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the persons concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_7673">My Department is currently processing applications received in late September / early October 2006 thus the existing processing time for long term residency is approximately twenty months. This is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years.  Having regard to the overall resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved. I understand however, that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service has in recent weeks allocated substantial additional resources to this work with a view to providing an improved customer service and reducing the existing processing times.</p>

            <p eId="para_7799">I am advised by officials in the Long Term Residency Section of my Department that the position in relation to granting long term residence (currently processed as an Administrative Scheme) is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years (i.e., 60 months) on the basis of Work Permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_7800">Long Term Residency is granted on the basis that a non EEA national has completed five years (60 months) legal residence in the State on Work Permit conditions, which is reflected in the corresponding Stamp 1 or Stamp 4 endorsements on a person's passport and not by the dates of commencement and expiry of each Work Permit. Subsequently, in calculating the reckonable period of 60 months legal residence, my Department only takes into consideration time legally spent in the State on work permit conditions. Periods of time, where a person has not had legal residence, i.e., having an up to date endorsement on Work Permit conditions in their passport, cannot be counted towards an application for Long Term Residency.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years (60 months) may also apply for Long Term Residency. This particular permission does not exempt the dependants from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_7801">The following documents, together with a cover letter of application clearly indicating the passport endorsements relating to each work permit are required:</p>
            <p eId="para_7802">Copy of work permits</p>
            <p eId="para_7803">Copy of Certificate of Registration (GNIB card)</p>
            <p eId="para_7804">Clear and legible copy of passport, including all endorsements (if the holder's passport has expired since arrival in the State, copies of both the previous and current passport are required)</p>

            <p eId="para_7827">I propose to take Questions Nos. 859 and 875 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7828">The person concerned first arrived in the State on 1 March 2002 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 25 February 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_7829">It would appear that the person concerned, on a date unknown, subsequently left the State and, on 13 March 2008, sought to claim asylum in the United Kingdom at which point, through the medium of a fingerprint comparison, it was apparent that the person concerned had previously claimed asylum in this State. In accordance with the provisions of Article 16(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Dublin II Regulations, the United Kingdom formally requested that Ireland ‘take back’ the person concerned and this request was accommodated. As a result, the person concerned was returned to this State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7830">As is the practice in such cases, a person who is returned to this State in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations, is returned to the position they previously held in the asylum/immigration process. In the case of the person concerned, his case, as before, falls to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). As part of this process, given that the personal, domestic and other circumstances of the person concerned may have altered since the last representations were submitted on his behalf in March 2003, a representative of my Department will be writing to the person concerned in the coming days to invite him, within a specified timeframe, to submit updated representations. This communication will be copied to the last known legal representative of the person concerned. The case file of the person concerned will be considered further upon receipt of a response to this communication.</p>

         asked the

         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that members of An Garda Síochána no longer supply victim support organisations with the names of victims of crime who may require assistance due to provisions contained in the data protection legislation and that as a consequence victim support is currently being provided to substantially fewer people than in the past; and the action he proposes to take to resolve the difficulty that has arisen.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_7844">Disclosure of personal data held by the Garda Síochána to non-Garda personnel is governed by the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 which set out the obligations of data controllers on the one hand and the rights of data subjects on the other in regard to the processing and disclosure of personal data.</p>
            <p eId="para_7845">In regard to the disclosure of personal data to third parties, the general rule is that there is a prohibition on the disclosure of personal data to third parties unless the disclosure is compatible with the purpose or purposes for which the data was obtained.  This prohibition is lifted in certain restricted cases by section 8 of the Act, one of the provisions of which permits the disclosure of personal data where such disclosure is made at the request of, or with the consent of, the data subject.  I am aware that as an organisation the Garda Síochána takes its responsibility for the control of the data it processes about individuals very seriously.  This is to ensure no unauthorised disclosures are made.  I should add that there are a number of different support organisations working in the field of victim support and it is clearly not a matter for the Garda Síochána to recommend one organisation over another to a victim.   However, where a victim so requests the Gardaí can put them in touch with a support organisation.  It is a matter for the individual to choose which support service, if any, to avail of.</p>
            <p eId="para_7846">It is Garda Síochána policy to provide the best service possible to victims of crime and to encourage referrals to support organisations. The Garda Síochána have, therefore, adopted the procedure of issuing a letter to all victims of crime, informing them of the organisations available to provide support to victims of crime. This letter gives details of the National Crime Victims Helpline, also funded by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime (CSVC), which acts as a first port of call for victims and which is there to listen, inform and where necessary, to refer a victim to support services in their local area.  They also provide information on all aspects of the criminal justice system.  The Helpline is there to provide such information and other support at lowcall number 1850 211 407.   For example during 2007 the Helpline received 1,963 requests from members of the public for information and/or assistance.   In 2007 the Helpline was able to deal with approximately 80% of their contacts without the need for further referral to local support services.  I understand that the CSVC are commissioning further research into the support needs of victims of crime and the factors involved in the demand for such support services.  I welcome this initiative by the CSVC.</p>

This Bill will provide an updated statutory framework for the taking and use of forensic samples and will repeal the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990. A central element of this updated framework will be the establishment of a DNA database for the purposes of criminal investigations and the identification of missing or unknown deceased persons or seriously injured persons.  The Bill will draw on the recommendations of the Report of the Law Reform Commission concerning the establishment of a DNA Database (LRC 78-2005).</p>

The Deputy will appreciate that a Bill of this nature requires careful drafting, to ensure, on the one hand, that it contains adequate safeguards for the rights of those from whom forensic material is to be taken while at the same time providing a practical framework that maximises the potential benefits of such a database from the operational and technical perspectives of the Garda Síochána, the Forensic Science Laboratory and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_7859">In accordance with section 22 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations are a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the Annual Policing Plan.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the Clarecastle area is serviced from Ennis Garda Station approximately two miles away.  The personnel strength (all ranks) of Ennis Garda Station as at 31st May, 2008 was 120.   I am also advised that Clarecastle is one of four Community Policing areas in the Ennis District which has one member allocated on a full-time basis to the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_7860">I am further informed that opening a Garda Station at Clarecastle would necessitate the deployment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively deployed on outdoor policing duties.  The assignment of Garda personnel, including civilian staff is continually monitored and reviewed by the Commissioner to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_7908">Under section 19 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002, a local area plan must be consistent with the objectives of the development plan for the area.  Section 10(2) of the Act sets out the mandatory objectives of a development plan which include, inter alia: the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure such as transport and water; the provision or facilitation of the provision of services for the community such as schools, crèches and other education and childcare facilities; and the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities.  Section 9(6) requires that development plans be consistent with national plans, policies and strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_7909">These requirements are restated in my Department's statutory Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans (2007), which included a dedicated appendix on provisions for schools and school planning prepared in consultation with the Department of Education and Science.

I intend to finalise these guidelines later this year.  The draft guidelines are also available on my Department's website.</p>

           if, in view of his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 117 of 27 May 2008, he will assist local authorities in conducting an extensive registration campaign in preparation for the upcoming local elections; the expected cost of such a campaign to his Department and to each of the local authorities; if he will employ outside expertise for such a campaign; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7942">In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.</p>
            <p eId="para_7943">In working to compile the Register for 2007/8, local authorities undertook and completed, with assistance from my Department, the most extensive registration campaign in decades. On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared to previous years.</p>
            <p eId="para_7944">The task now for local authorities, in relation to the Register for 2009/10, is to maintain and build on the progress made to date. In this regard, my Department has supplied local authorities with stocks of the relevant forms to be used in the compilation of the next Register; the form has been redesigned to include specific information on the 2009 Local and European Elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_7945">Local authorities have also been given, for the first time, a multi-lingual prompt card (in 14 languages) for use by fieldworkers to explain the registration process to all the people they meet. At Draft Register stage, my Department will run an advertising campaign to encourage people to check that they are on the Register.</p>
            <p eId="para_7946">Beyond that, I welcome the recent report of the Joint Committee on Environment, Heritage and Local Government in relation to The Future of the Electoral Register in Ireland and Related Matters. The report is consistent with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government to establish an Electoral Commission, with responsibilities to include compiling a new national rolling electoral register, and is an important input to future Government decisions in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_8061">I propose to take Questions Nos. 895 and 896 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8062">Expenditure on the provision of social housing through the local authority housing programme, the voluntary and co-operative housing programme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) last year amounted to some €1.242 billion.  Funding provided for these programmes has been increased again in 2008, with some €1.369 billion available.  This will allow for the commencement of a significant number of new social housing units and the completion of a large number of units under these programmes this year. Funding and administration of rent supplement is a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8063">The impact of the record levels of investment this Government is committing to these housing programmes is already evident.  Last year, over 9,400 social housing units were delivered, which represented an increase of over 40% on 2006.  Figures for activity in the first quarter of 2008 are not yet finalised but indications from returns received to date from local authorities are that strong activity is being sustained.</p>
            <p eId="para_8064">The Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP) reflect the strong commitment to expand social and affordable housing provision contained in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016.  The needs of some 100,000 households are to be met through the full range of social housing measures, including through the commencement and acquisition of 63,000 new social homes in the period 2007-2013.

            <p eId="para_8066">My Department provides direct funding to local authorities for the provision of affordable housing under the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme through the subsidisation of the site costs. A subsidy is available to local authorities to make houses affordable by covering all or part of the cost of the site so that the selling price of the unit is within the income range of the target group.</p>
            <p eId="para_8067">To further assist households with income below €28,000 in the previous tax year, a mortgage subsidy or, as appropriate, a rental subsidy under the Shared Ownership Scheme is available to these purchasers. This subsidy is paid by my Department to the local authority advancing the loan and is intended to reduce the monthly outgoings of the purchaser. A mortgage allowance of €11,450 spread over 5 years is also available to assist tenants or tenant purchasers of local authority houses to become owner-occupiers of other dwellings and tenants of dwellings provided by approved voluntary housing bodies under the Capital Loan and Subsidy scheme, who return their accommodation to the body, thus making it available for re-letting.</p>
            <p eId="para_8068">Details of this expenditure by my Department during 2007 is as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_8076">For 2008, my Department has set aside €71m for site subsidy and a further programme of affordable housing acquisitions by the AHP, €4.2m for Rental and Mortgage subsidy and €3.8m for Mortgage Allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_8077">This direct funding by my Department represents only one element of the overall range of supports for the various affordable housing schemes. Significant support under the schemes is provided by way of non-voted capital expenditure. This allows local authorities to purchase the units and also provides mortgage finance for house purchasers, where necessary, by means of borrowing through the Housing Finance Agency. In addition, investment in affordable housing is supported through the assignment of State lands for this purpose and through the delivery mechanism under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_8099">The information sought in the question is not available in my Department, but may be obtained directly from local authorities who have primary responsibility for the registration of self-compliant major producers as set out under the regulatory regime for packaging waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_8100">In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, Ireland, like many other Member States of the European Union, approached the implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste on the basis that those businesses which have a major commercial involvement with the placing of packaging on the market (i.e. importers, manufacturers, packer/fillers, distributors and retailers) should have primary responsibility for devising, operating and financing systems for the recovery and recycling of packaging wastes which subsequently arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_8101">The Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2007, which revised and replaced previous regulations made in 2003 as well as amending regulations made in 2004 and 2006 respectively, are intended to facilitate the achievement by Ireland of the 60% packaging waste recovery target by end 2011 as set out in Directive 2004/12/EC which amended the original Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste.  These Regulations provide the necessary legal framework to facilitate the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_8102">Under the Regulations, all producers placing packaging materials, packaging or packaged products on the Irish market must segregate the packaging waste arising on their own premises into specified waste streams (i.e. waste aluminium, fibreboard, glass, paper, plastic sheeting, steel and wood) and have it collected by authorised operators for recycling, effectively prohibiting the landfill of such materials from commercial sources.  In addition, major producers, i.e. those who have an annual turnover in excess of €1 million and who place more than 10 tonnes of packaging on the Irish market, have additional responsibilities with regard to the recovery of packaging waste from their customers, meeting quarterly targets, preparation of implementation plans and annual reports, placing of signage on their premises, advertising take-back, and registration with local authorities.  Registration is subject to a minimum fee of €500 per premises rising by an incremental €15 per tonne of packaging placed on the market up to a maximum fee of no more than €15,000 per premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_8103">Major producers have the option of either complying directly with their producer responsibility obligations (i.e. self-compliance), or alternatively, getting an exemption from those requirements by becoming a member of a packaging waste compliance scheme.  Repak Limited — established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under the Packaging Directives — is the sole approved compliance scheme for the recovery of packaging waste in Ireland.  Repak membership income is used to subsidise the collection of packaging waste from both the household and commercial sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_8104">Ireland has enjoyed considerable success in achieving the prescribed targets under Directive 94/62/EC.  In 2001, Ireland assisted by Repak met the 25% packaging waste recovery target required under the Directive 94/62/EC — a 27% recovery rate was reported as having been achieved, all by way of recycling.  The end 2005 target of 50% was achieved for the first time in 2003 with 51.2% of packaging waste reported as recycled in that year.  An overall recovery rate of 57.3% was reported for the year 2006 indicating that Ireland has continued to achieve its 50% target and is well on the way to meeting the overall 60% recovery rate (with 55% by way of recycling) required by end 2011.</p>

Detailed information on the number of sales through tenant purchase by housing authorities since 1994 is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie and in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  As these are now privately owned homes, my Department does not routinely collect information on the number of these homes subsequently sold on by purchasers or on the time frame within which these sales occur.</p>

            <p eId="para_8116">I am aware of information regarding vacant dwellings, published by the Central Statistics Office as part of the 2006 Census results which, I understand, was derived from analysis of cases where Census forms were not received from dwellings by enumerators. The total number of dwellings reported vacant by CSO on this basis on the Census night, 23 April 2006, was 266,000. This represented around 15% of the overall housing stock, which is slightly lower than the EU average according to data published by the International Monetary Fund and well below the reported vacancy rate reported in some individual States.</p>
            <p eId="para_8117">I understand that an estimated 50,000 of the dwellings reported vacant at the 2006 Census were reported by CSO to be holiday homes. The remaining 216,000 represent about 12% of the total housing stock. Dwellings can be vacant at any given time for a variety of reasons and a significant level of vacancy can be expected in a dynamic society experiencing significant mobility and demographic change.</p>
            <p eId="para_8118">An important element of the Government's housing policy is to promote the availability of an adequate supply of housing to meet demand and provide support to those who cannot meet their accommodation needs without assistance, as outlined in the Government's housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities. My Department will continue to keep developments in the housing market, including trends in housing supply, under review in consultation with other relevant agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_8122">Following the announcement by Dublin City Council on Monday, 19 May 2008, that a number of regeneration projects being carried out through PPP arrangements would not now be proceeding as planned, my Department and the Council have met on a number of occasions to examine the implications of the announcement for the projects concerned. The City Council has informed my Department that, while the developer in question has not formally withdrawn from the projects, he has indicated that due to the adversely changed circumstances of the current private housing market, along with additional costs cited due to increased apartment sizes and new energy requirements, the approach under which the projects were tendered is unsustainable in the current market.</p>
            <p eId="para_8123">The City Council has since been engaged in discussions with the developer to identify the next steps to progress the projects.  Revised proposals have been received for some of the projects and are being examined by the local authority.  No contracts had been signed for the projects at St. Michael's Estate and Dominick Street, and the City Council is actively engaged with the developer to establish his interest in proceeding with these projects.  On all of the projects the City Council is working closely with the relevant regeneration boards, and has indicated its commitment to the remaining tenants in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_8124">The City Council has undertaken to review all of the options available for advancing the projects concerned, taking account of the outcome of ongoing discussions with the developer.  My Department is also examining the potential implications of these events for the PPP housing programme generally and a working group has been established to further this aim.</p>

            <p eId="para_8283">My Department commissioned a report to identify measures that would assist in responding to the targets set for affordable housing in Towards 2016.  The report "Increasing Affordable Housing Supply" was prepared by consultants for the Affordable Homes Partnership as part of their role in providing services to the Minister and local authorities in relation to affordable housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_8284">One of the main recommendations made in the report is the replacement of the current Shared Ownership Scheme with a scheme based on a new equity loan product.  The rationale for this, including a comparison of the schemes, is set out in the report which was published on 25 April 2008 and is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_8285">The approach suggested in the report would allow up to 30% of the purchase price of a house to be funded through an equity loan, with the balance obtained through private mortgage finance.  The equity loan would be placed as a second charge on the property and would not be repayable until after 35 years or on the sale of the house.  The householder would have registered title to the property.  This differs from the Shared Ownership Scheme where rent is paid on the un-purchased share of the house which is effectively leased from the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_8286">A consultation on the various aspects of the report, including the equity-based loan, was launched at the end of April.  In addition to the public consultation, my Department is consulting with the social partners, housing practitioners and financial institutions.  I will be considering the outcome of this process in the context of the further development of policy on paths to home ownership, including through affordable housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_8330">Before carrying out any works in an historic graveyard, or to any structures within it, voluntary community groups should check the ownership of the graveyard. Many historic graveyards are owned by either the relevant local authority or the Church of Ireland. In some cases, all or part of the graveyard may consist of a national monument in my ownership or guardianship.</p>
            <p eId="para_8331">If the graveyard, or a structure within it, is a national monument in my ownership or guardianship, or in the ownership or guardianship of a local authority, or if a preservation order has been placed on it, then my consent, as Minister, is required under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004 for any works that are to be carried out at, or in proximity to, such a national monument. I am required under the Acts to consult with the Director of the National Museum of Ireland on any application for such consent. Furthermore, Section 12(3) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994 provides for the protection of monuments and places listed on the statutory Record of Monuments and Places. Two months notification in writing must be given to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of any proposed works at or in relation to such monuments or places.  The statutory Record of Monuments and Places may be consulted at any local authority office.</p>
            <p eId="para_8332">Generally, my advice is that, for the avoidance of doubt, voluntary community groups should contact the National Monuments Service of my Department prior to carrying out any works in an historic graveyard.  It is best not to start works without professional advice and an agreed workplan.</p>
            <p eId="para_8333">In relation to graveyard extensions, while I understand that there is often a very strong attachment to ancient church sites, my Department must examine each application for consent to any such extension on a case-by-case basis. Difficulties can arise with extensions to historic graveyards where there is (a) a national monument in the graveyard, (b) evidence of an early ecclesiastical enclosure around the graveyard or (c) the likelihood of archaeological deposits around the graveyard. This would be the case with many graveyards that are of medieval origin. In such cases I would encourage the relevant local authority and the community to consider the option of opening new graveyards at an alternative location away from the ancient site. I am aware that this option has been successfully followed in many areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_8334">If, however, it is decided to pursue the option of extending the graveyard and if there are grounds for believing there may be archaeological deposits around the existing graveyard then it would be necessary in all cases to carry out an archaeological assessment. This usually involves exploratory archaeological excavation, the cost of which must be borne by those proposing to extend the graveyard.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_8352">The Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP) reflect the strong commitment to expand social and affordable housing provision contained in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016. The NDP provides the resources — some €18 billion in total — which will support increased output from social and affordable housing measures and result in the needs of some 140,000 new households being met in this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_8353">Within this, a significant programme of activity to assist house purchase is provided for. In particular, over the period of the NDP, some 40,000 households will benefit from affordable housing. While the supply of affordable housing has increased consistently over recent years and further expansion is envisaged, my Department continues to work closely with local authorities and the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) to achieve the significant increase in delivery required to meet these ambitious targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_8354">In that context, the AHP was requested to conduct a study on ways in which the range of existing affordable housing mechanisms might be improved or expanded in order, principally, to increase supply and accelerate delivery. The study is now completed and the resultant report, Increasing Affordable Housing Supply, has been published for public consultation with a view to submitting proposals to Government following completion of the consultation process. Preparations for the introduction of a new Incremental Purchase Scheme, to be targeted at households with an income lower than that required for affordable housing, are also underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_8355">In addition, the NDP resources will be used to meet the needs of some 100,000 households through a range of social housing measures. A total of 63,000 new social homes will be commenced/acquired in the period 2007-2013, through a combination of local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing and new units for the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  Further households will benefit either as they transfer to the Rental Accommodation Scheme with their existing landlords or from naturally occurring vacancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_8356">The impact of the record levels of investment that the Government is committing to these housing programmes is now being seen.  Last year, some 13,000 social and affordable housing units were delivered — a record level of output — and the resources allocated this year will allow for the commencement of a significant number of new social housing units, further progress under regeneration programmes, and the completion of a large number of units under both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8360">Under Section 126 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, An Bord Pleanála has a statutory objective to determine appeals within 18 weeks.  Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of delays arising from the holding of an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make the decision.</p>

The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly in a robust manner and that consumers continue to be guided towards discerning choices.  The scheme is continuing to support a range of objectives including more competitive offerings, revised product standards, improved training standards and stable growth across the renewable heating industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_8757">The Greener Homes Scheme will continue to be kept under review, and will continue to evolve in light of the maturing technologies and market developments, including the consideration of additional technologies such as wood log gasifiers.</p>

While not all premises in Dublin central can receive broadband services over all of these platforms, I am encouraged that increasing competition between the platforms is addressing previous supply side difficulties, particularly with DSL.</p>

            <p eId="para_8809">In regard to County Clare fisheries, these hold good stocks of coarse fish which are utilised by both local and tourist anglers.

            <p eId="para_8810">As regards the protection of coarse fish stocks, my Department introduced the Conservation of and Prohibition on Sale of Coarse Fish Bye Law No. 806, 2006 and the Conservation of Pike Bye Law No. 809, 2006, which control fishing for coarse fish.  These bye-laws provide for a number of conservation measures including limiting the number of fish that may be taken by anglers and were introduced to prevent over exploitation of coarse fish and pike in rivers, canals and lakes.  In the Shannon region, the ShRFB has been working with local anglers and communities to implement these bylaws and additional resources have been redirected to deal with incidents in County Clare and other areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_8922">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Details of broadband suppliers, prices and locations throughout the country are available on <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_8923">The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.  I have no function in the enablement of telephone exchanges for the provision of fixed line broadband, which is a matter for private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_8924">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_8925">Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_8926">The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete.  The remaining candidates have been engaged in "Competitive Dialogue" with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_8927">Judicial Review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process took place on 10 and 11 June 2008 in the High Court and a judgement is awaited.  While the outcome of the Judicial Review cannot be anticipated, it is currently expected that a preferred bidder for the NBS will be selected in September 2008, with rollout to commence as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

            <p eId="para_8929">Under the Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020 the Government is committed to rebalancing the strategic oil reserve by maximising Ireland's wholly owned stocks of oil and the level of stocks held on the island, subject to increased storage availability and value for money considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_8930">The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) is working to increase the volume of NORA owned oil stocks stored on the island of Ireland in order to reduce Ireland's dependence on stock tickets and storage abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_8931">The NORA Strategic Storage Plan 2008-2012 envisages that by 2012 the Agency will own 80 days of Ireland's European Union obligation in both Category I oil (Petrol) and Category II (Middle Distillates — Kerosene, Jet Kerosene, Gasoil and Diesel).  As consumer companies hold large quantities of EU Category III (Fuel Oil) there is no need for NORA to own any of this category of oil.</p>
            <p eId="para_8932">NORA currently owns 36 days of Category I oil most of which is stored in Ireland.  NORA also owns 62 days of Category II stocks most of which is stored in Ireland.  NORA has purchased 12 days of Category II stocks since the beginning of the year and the Agency is in the process of purchasing a further 14 days of this category of oil during quarters 3 and 4 of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8933">The NORA Strategic Storage Plan 2008-2012 envisages purchasing additional stocks of oil for storage in Ireland during the period of the Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_8934">All NORA purchases of oil are funded by the industry levy on oil product sales. No Exchequer funding is provided for strategic oil storage.  The Review of Security of Oil Supplies is currently being finalised and will inform decisions in relation to further strategic measures to secure oil stocks.</p>

It is the case that the two jurisdictions continue to operate different schemes to support the construction and operation of new renewable energy powered electricity generating plants.</p>
            <p eId="para_8967">The support mechanism in Ireland is the renewable energy feed-in tariff programme (REFIT), which is based on fixed-feed-in tariffs.  This mechanism provides guaranteed prices to projects for each kilowatt hour of electricity produced without recourse to grant aid.  The subvention in Northern Ireland for similar projects is the Renewable Obligations Certificates programme (ROCs), which is part of a wider UK support programme based on certificate trading.  There are no proposals to change the REFIT scheme in Ireland or the programme currently operating in Northern Ireland to move towards a single support mechanism.</p>

            <p eId="para_8969">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Details of broadband suppliers, prices and locations throughout the country are available on <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_8970">The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_8971">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_8972">Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_8973">The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete. The remaining candidates have been engaged in "Competitive Dialogue" with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_8974">Judicial Review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process took place on 10 and 11 June 2008 in the High Court and a judgement is awaited.  While the outcome of the Judicial Review cannot be anticipated, it is currently expected that a preferred bidder for the NBS will be selected in September 2008, with rollout to commence as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

            <p eId="para_8976">In 2007, an amount of €261,029.75 was spent on public relations by the Press Office of my Department.  This is broken down as follows:</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_1214">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_8982">The Government's Decentralisation Programme involves the relocation of my Department's headquarters to Cavan and the relocation of three bodies under its aegis, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) to Dundalk, Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) to Dungarvan and the Central Fisheries Board (CFB) to Carrick-on-Shannon.</p>
            <p eId="para_8983">A permanent site has been acquired, by the Office of Public Works (OPW), for the Department's HQ in Cavan and my Department is liaising with OPW in relation to accommodation requirements there.  In the meantime, temporary rental accommodation to accommodate 60 staff has already been acquired for an advance party and we have had a presence in Cavan since October 2006.  Discussions are ongoing with OPW on additional temporary accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8984">As regards SEI, temporary accommodation has been acquired in Dundalk pending a permanent move and SEI is liaising with OPW on options for permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8985">OSI is also in discussions with OPW in relation to permanent accommodation options in Dungarvan, and is carrying out a feasibility exercise in relation to a possible advance party.</p>
            <p eId="para_8986">OPW has recently identified a possible permanent HQ for the CFB in Carrick-on-Shannon and matters on that front are being progressed with the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_8987">As the Deputy will be aware, the bulk of accommodation related costs associated with the Decentralisation Programme are to be met by the OPW.  I understand that of the total allocation of €833 million provided in the NDP for Decentralisation, an estimate of €60 million is provided for agencies whose costs will not be funded through the OPW Vote.  The balance of €773 million represents the estimated cost of providing accommodation for the Departments and agencies whose accommodation will be paid for by the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_8988">Property solutions are being pursued in respect of my Department and its agencies as part of the overall Decentralisation Programme to be funded from the OPW Vote. Firm scale costs will emerge on foot of actual cost proposals being received from the market.  It would not be possible to give definitive costings in advance of final agreement on specific proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_8989">In relation to the operational costs of the Cavan building, some of these, such as rent, are paid by OPW.  Operational costs in Cavan which are charged to the Vote of the Department are not disaggregated from such costs as arise in relation to all accommodation of the Department and therefore cannot be separately quantified.</p>
            <p eId="para_8990">The costs incurred by Agencies in this regard are a day to day operational matter for the agencies themselves in which I have no function.</p>
