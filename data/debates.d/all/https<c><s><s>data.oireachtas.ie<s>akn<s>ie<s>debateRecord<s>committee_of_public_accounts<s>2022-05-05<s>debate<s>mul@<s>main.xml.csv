No apologies have been received. To limit the spread of Covid-19, I ask all in attendance to wear face coverings when not addressing the committee. The Service requests that those present continue to wear such coverings when moving about the campus and when in close proximity to others, to respect other people's physical space and the public health advice. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament. The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is the permanent witness to the committee and he is accompanied by Mr. Leonard McKeown, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This morning we will engage with the Department of Finance to examine the following matters: the 2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts and Vote 7 - Finance and the 2020 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Chapter 1 - Exchequer financial outturn for 2020, and Chapter 16 - Ireland Apple escrow fund; and the audited financial statements of the Exchequer 2020. The Department has been advised that the committee may wish to examine the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and matters related to vehicle registration tax during the course of the engagement. We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from that Department: Mr. John Hogan, Secretary General; Ms Emma Cunningham, assistant secretary; Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist; and Mr. Des Carville, head of shareholding and financial advisory division. The personnel from the finance Vote section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were unavailable for today's meeting. I remind all of those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off or are on silent. Before we start I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. As such witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything that they may say at the meeting. However, they are not expected to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such directions. Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits or objective of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	1	Gabhaim buíochas, a Chathaoirligh. Bunreacht na hÉireann requires all revenues of the State to be paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, unless required otherwise by legislation. Funds are issued from the Central Fund on the authority of the Oireachtas to pay for public services, either through annual voted provisions in the Estimates process, or under standing statutory provisions to pay for what are called "Central Fund services". It is estimated that around 75% of total annual Government receipts and spending passes through the Central Fund. The finance accounts are prepared each year by the Department of Finance, to present an account of the Central Fund transactions. The format of the accounts has evolved over time, and is unlike that of any other set of annual financial statements that come before the committee. The accounts are prepared on a cash basis, and so represent the actual movements of cash in the year. The annual Exchequer account presents the cash receipts into and cash issues from the Central Fund. The account is presented together with a set of schedules that analyse the transactions, with a significant amount of explanation and detail set out in footnotes. The financial statements of the national debt of Ireland, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, are also appended as part of the finance accounts. Chapter 1 of my report on the accounts of the public services is a recurring chapter, which is designed to summarise the transactions on the Central Fund in a more accessible format, and to highlight key trends over time. While budget 2020 had forecast a small Exchequer surplus for the year, the outturn was an Exchequer deficit of just over €12.3 billion, primarily due to increases in voted issues to fund Covid-19 support measures. As the finance accounts do not include a balance sheet, or a statement of the Exchequer’s financial position at the year end, the chapter on the Exchequer outturn aims to provide a summary position of key assets and liabilities at the year end. I will briefly outline just three of the liabilities that will impact the Central Fund into the future. As the national debt account shows, Ireland’s national debt at the end of 2020 stood at €219.5 billion, up €12.8 billion from the end of 2019. However, the cost to the Exchequer of servicing the debt continued to fall, and fell by more than 10% in 2020, due to the refinancing of older, higher cost debt. Liabilities under public private partnerships, or PPPs, are regarded as "off balance sheet" from a general Government perspective. PPP-related commitments outstanding at the end of 2020 totalled an estimated €6.7 billion. The third point I will draw attention to is that the State is the sole contributor to the Eircom No. 2 pension fund. Towards the end of 2020, the fund’s remaining assets were almost fully exhausted. It is estimated that Exchequer funding of approximately €84 million for 2021 and €86 million a year thereafter will be required to meet the liabilities of the fund to Eircom pensioners. Pursuant to section 28 of the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2000, the Minister for Finance delegated to the NTMA a range of functions in respect of the Ireland Apple escrow fund, including the production of annual financial statements which are subject to audit by me. These are published separately from the other NTMA accounts. The net assets of the escrow fund were €13.984 billion at year end 2020. This represents a decrease of €36 million from the 2019 net assets balance of €14.02 billion. The 2020 appropriation account for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance records gross expenditure of just under €36 million.This is divided between two expenditure programmes. These relate to the costs incurred in respect of economic and fiscal policy, on which the Department spent €23.6 million, and banking and financial services policy, on which the Department spent €12.4 million. Members may wish to note that the NTMA has provided a number of staff on loan to the Department to work in its banking unit. The related staff costs, and certain consultancy costs, are paid directly by the NTMA and are not recouped from the Department. In 2020, the costs incurred by the NTMA in that regard amounted to €1.8 million. This was in addition to the expenditure on banking and financial services policy recorded in the appropriation accounts.

This is his first appearance before us as he was appointed since the last time that Department officials were here. I wish him the best in his new position. He has five minutes in which to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	3	I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for affording me the opportunity to address the committee. I think that the Chairman identified some of the officers and officials who accompany me. We have Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, Ms Emma Cunningham, head of tax, and Mr. Des Carville, head of the shareholding and financial advisory division. We also have Ms Scline Scott, head of corporate division, and Ms Laura Cunningham, our finance officer. I will focus on the specific items on today’s agenda and keep my comments brief. The agenda covers the Appropriation Accounts 2020, Chapters 1 and 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s Annual Report 2020, and the Finance Accounts. As the Chairman mentioned, the committee has a number of items to discuss with us, including the special liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. Turning to Vote 7, the Estimate for the Department for 2020 was set at €39.9 million or €38.6 million net of appropriations-in-aid available. The gross outturn spend for the year was just under €36 million, €3.9 million or 9.7% under the available allocation. As a result, the Department surrendered just under €3.4 million to the Exchequer. The end-year surplus arose for a number of reasons. There was an underspend of over €600,000 on consultancy and other services costs; around €800,000 of the capital budget was left unspent as a result of the public health restrictions in the construction sector; for similar reasons there was an underspend on travel and subsistence, which was very much linked to Covid-19; and finally, there was an underspend on the disabled drivers fuel grant scheme of €530,000. As members know, this scheme is demand-led and is difficult to predict with great certainty. In terms of the Exchequer Financial Outturn for 2020, I draw the committee's attention to the following key points. Despite the pandemic, tax revenues held up well, falling by just €2.1 billion or 3.6% on 2019. The two key drivers of the better-than-expected performance were income tax and corporation tax. Income tax is the largest tax head, accounting for 40% of the overall tax revenues in 2020. Taxes in the year were €22.7 billion, only €200 million lower than 2019 despite the high number of people in need of support via the pandemic unemployment payment. The strong performance of income taxes was the result of the progressivity of the income tax system, interposed with the sectoral nature of the employment shock. Unfortunately, those worst affected by the pandemic were predominately in lower paid employment areas. However, as lower paid workers are largely kept outside the income tax net, the impact on income tax receipts was less than could be expected given the overall level of joblessness. Corporation tax also over-performed, mainly due to high levels of profitability in a number of key sectors. The volatility and unpredictability of corporation tax receipts pose a challenge to the continued stability in the public finances. The Department currently estimates that the impact of international tax reform discussions under way will be in the region of €2 billion per annum relative to baseline. As the discussions at OECD and EU levels continue, the impact will be kept under close review and updated accordingly. The more domestically focussed tax heads, namely VAT and excise, were heavily impacted by the pandemic, as consumer spending collapsed as a result of public health restrictions. VAT returns fell €2.7 billion on 2019 to €12.4 billion, while excise receipts for the year were just under €5.5 billion, €500 million lower than 2019. On the expenditure side, total net voted expenditure was €67.8 billion, an increase of some €13.7 billion or 25% on 2019. The significant growth in expenditure reflected Government policy to use the public sector balance sheet to offset the pandemic-induced contraction in private demand. For example, the three main income and business support schemes, which were the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme and its predecessor the temporary wage subsidy scheme, as well as the Covid restrictions support scheme cost the Exchequer nearly €9.5 billion in 2020. Turning to the Apple escrow fund, the committee is aware that as part of the European Commission's decision of August 2016, Ireland was ordered to recover from Apple the alleged State aid plus interest related to a ten-year period from 2003 up to 2014. Notwithstanding Ireland's appeal against the Commission's decision, the Irish Government complied with its obligation to recover the sum of €13.1 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Minister for Finance agreed with Apple that the amounts collected would be held in an escrow fund until the legal process is completed. The Ireland Apple escrow fund was established under the terms of a formal agreement between the Minister for Finance and Apple, pending the final outcome of legal challenges to the findings of a State-aid investigation undertaken by the European Commission. The investment and management of the fund is jointly overseen by the Minister and Apple, with the Minister's functions delegated to the NTMA. The financial statements for 2020, published on 22 June, set out that the net assets at the end of 2020 totalled €13.98 million. The €36 million decline for the year primarily reflects the negative interest rate environment and negative yields on highly rated euro-sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds that existed in 2020. In terms of the Department, I will briefly describe the role that the Department plays in the effective implementation of Government policy. The Department's mission is to lead in the achievement of the Government's economic, fiscal and financial policy goals having regard to the programme for Government. In late 2020, the Department published a new Strategy Statement 2021-2023, which sets out how the Department will continue to work towards achieving strategic goals pertaining to public finances, the economy, the financial sector and the environment. Despite the enormous challenges posed by Covid-19 in 2020 the Department continued to make progress on achieving these goals. More recently, as the pandemic has receded, the fall-out from the war in Ukraine has posed new and significant challenges for the domestic and international economy through terms of trade shocks not seen since the 1980s coupled with an enormous humanitarian crisis. Officials from the Department of Finance, while engaging with colleagues from across the civil and public service in a whole-of-Government response, have been working hard across a number of key areas. Specifically, the Department has been at the forefront of the implementation of financial market sanctions, as well as working with Government on designing and implementing measures to respond to the cost of living pressures now being felt across society as a result of the issues. The economic and financial consequences of the Ukraine invasion, both globally and in Ireland, will be considerable. The most direct economic channel through which the war has and will impact Ireland is inflation. The Stability Programme Update, published last month, sets out a scenario in which inflation would average 6.25% this year, falling to 3% next year. Conversely, the forecast for growth has been lowered to 4.25% of modified domestic demand this year, from 6.5% estimated in budget 2022. The fiscal impact will be large too. At this stage it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate as to the cost of supporting refugees arriving from Ukraine. Work to better understand the potential expenditure requirement is ongoing in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In closing, I first thank the Comptroller and Auditor General. We are always grateful to his office for the engagement and assistance we receive in ensuring that the Department produces accounts that meet the highest standards in public accounting. Finally, I thank the staff within the Department for their work during the period under review. They demonstrated considerable adaptability and flexibility in adopting to new working arrangements through 2020 to ensure that the core business of the Department continued, as well as put in an enormous effort to deliver and implement new temporary support arrangements at a time when the Irish economy and society most needed them. In addition, I am mindful of the successful collaboration with Oireachtas staff and members of both Houses to ensure the necessary Government and Oireachtas business and scrutiny was conducted as normal in abnormal times. To conclude, I thank the Chairman and members for their invitation to meet the committee today as well as for their attention. I welcome any follow-on questions.

I thank them for attending. I wish to raise a number of issues and the first one concerns the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme. The long-standing, long reported and long complained about issues relating to the scheme came to a head in 2020 with the decision by the Supreme Court. However, we have since had, essentially, the resignation of the medical board of appeal and it appears that the underlying issues have not been addressed. What is the Secretary General's view of the scheme as it operates now? How does the Department propose to address the very clear deficiencies that have been identified?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	6	There are a number of layers to this matter. The scheme has been in operation in various guises since, probably, the 1960s. The latest events in relation to a scheme, which was very tightly defined in statutory instruments and ultimately in recent times in legislation, have raised a number of issues for us.We are dealing with the issue on several fronts. In the first instance, as the Deputy is probably aware, the medical board of appeal has resigned and we are in the process of recruiting new members to the board. An open recruitment process concluded in recent days. We are now moving to assess the individuals who applied to that process and-----
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	7	May I ask a question? The new board will be appointed on exactly the same basis as the old board. In other words, its remit and terms of reference will be the same.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	8	The remit and terms of reference are the same. I am conscious of the fact that-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	10	If I may take the Deputy through our thinking on this, that might help with his question. I am conscious that several people who applied for primary medical certificates but were not successful in that application have sought a mechanism of appeal. The board of appeal resigned. That is a statement of fact. We need to find a mechanism through which those appeals can be dealt with and that is the process that we have under way in the first instance. The second item is the future of the scheme and how it is structured. I mentioned earlier that the scheme has probably been in existence since the 1960s. The definition of "disability" is very much framed in that era, if I may describe it in that way. It is framed against a definition of "disability" that is very much in the physical area. Some of the areas that were raised in the Supreme Court decision bring the wider aspects of disability into play. As part of the issue and how we bring this forward, there is an ongoing engagement with our colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, where the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is chairing a review group into transport mobility schemes. The progress from that in respect of policy outcomes should be very much framed in how we look at where the disabled drivers scheme should and could go in future. That stream of work is very much under way. We have been feeding into that but also looking at an information-gathering exercise which included the outgoing members of the disabled drivers board of appeal to see what best practice is internationally, how these issues are dealt with in other jurisdictions and whether tax is the appropriate mechanism for dealing with them. That work has progressed to a significant extent and we are now feeding it into the mechanism that is chaired by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. There is a two-pronged approach to what we are trying to do here. One aspect is to recognise that there may be legitimate reasons individuals believed they were unsuccessful in their application for a primary medical certificate and we need to find a mechanism for dealing with that in the short term, but in the longer term it is to look at the wider issue in respect of the whole scheme and how it fits into the best mechanism for supporting transport mobility for disabled people.

In assessing the applications, both the granters of the primary medical certificate and, ultimately, the board of appeal have to take cognisance of what is in the legislation and the terms of reference for the scheme. That is where we go into the wider piece in respect of what is the future and the best mechanism for supporting transport disability-----

The Comptroller and Auditor General has told us that Ireland's contribution to the EU budget in 2020 amounted to just under €2.6 billion, which was a 5.6% increase on the amount in 2019. Does Mr. Hogan accept it is always incredibly difficult to get a clear sense of what the EU receipts were in order to compare and contrast that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	22	I will give the Deputy some detail from a note I have just been handed, if I may. Ireland has been a net contributor to the EU budget since 2014 and the position has grown since then. Our gross contributions for the current multi-financial framework period from 2021 to 2027 are forecast to rise in the coming period.

What oversight do we have of that money? There has been much discussion at various committees, including this one weekly, exploring the detail of how moneys that have been approved are then expended. What oversight do we have nationally to ensure that our money that is being contributed to the EU budget is being well spent?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	36	If I may take a step back, the overall issue here is that we have now moved into the net contribution position. The Commission estimates the benefit to Ireland for our EU membership of the Single Market is approximately €30 billion, or close to 10% of our GNI. Many sectors of our society continue to benefit directly and indirectly from EU programmes, so we do see a benefit internally. Within the European system, there is oversight of it.

I am sorry to cut across Mr. Hogan. I am aware of that and of the work of the EU auditors and that there are budgetary oversight committees within the European Parliament. I am asking what is done at a national level to ensure the €4.5 billion we will be contributing to the EU budget will be expended in an appropriate manner, just as we would ascertain in respect of any other money that is being allocated from any Department.

As part of that process, we have representatives sitting on budgetary committees in Brussels who have oversight of the details of the programmes and the expenditure relating to all that. If it would be helpful, we could probably come back with more detail on the representation there.

It is a very big Department when you actually look into the detail of all it covers.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	62	The special assignee relief programme was introduced in the Finance Act 2021 with the aim of reducing the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals in their companies. Some 1,574 employees availed of the SARP directly in 2019. The annual cost of it has fallen by about 10%, from €42 million in 2018 to €38 million in 2019.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	64	Yes, I believe the cap was beginning to have an effect at that stage.

There is an aggregate number of jobs that are associated with the scheme, where they were created and retained as a result of it. That increased to 862 in 2019. There was a significant decrease in the cost per SARP-related job at €44,000 in 2019, down from €73,000 in 2018.

Mr. Hogan mentioned the saving because of the €1 million cap. That was a reversal of a previous decision to remove the cap in 2015. Has the Department carried an analysis of what the State lost as a result of that cap being lifted for those three years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	68	The numbers feed through as part of the returns that come in through our Revenue Commissioners, so there is full transparency in terms of the cost associated with that. The change that we introduced in relation to the cap kind of reflects the fact that we continuously keep these tax expenditures under review. Where we feel there is a need to move the cap or reintroduce or make amendments, depending on how things are beginning to unfold in relation to the scheme, we move to do that.

I have a number of items that I want to touch on. As the previous speaker said, there is much to touch on within the Department. There are six specific items I want to ask about, namely, the NTMA; the EU budget; Irish Water; the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme; the Apple escrow fund; and legal costs - just to forewarn the Department officials. I will turn to the NTMA first and the long-term issuances in 2020 totalling €26 billion. I am just wondering about the overall cost of the €26 billion borrowed by the NTMA in 2020. Can the Department officials give me an outline on that? What is the current average interest rate of the NTMA borrowing? What oversight does the Department actually have on the primary dealers that currently have authority to issue Irish Government bonds? I will leave those questions to be answered now and then we will turn to Irish Water next.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	80	On the NTMA piece, over the past number of years we have seen a reprofiling and an elongation of our debt issuance. Certainly, if the Deputy looks at the cost of servicing the debt, even as far back as 2013, I believe the cost was anticipated to be in the order of about €7.5 billion. That has fallen substantially over the past number of years. The NTMA has taken advantage of the low interest rate environment to reprofile, as the Comptroller and Auditor General rightly noted in his presentation, the more expensive debt that was taken on board by the Irish State at that time. There has been a success in that regard, particularly in taking advantage of what was available on the international markets to reprofile and reorientate our debt at considerable saving to the Exchequer. If I look at the wider debt picture at the moment, the thing to note is that we are seeing an increase in bond yields. It is very clear that the cost of borrowing internationally will increase over the next while. It is something that the Department has been signalling through our different publications over the past while, probably covered in the stability programme update, SPU, over the past number of days and certainly the annual debt report that was compiled by the Department earlier in the year. There has been a strong success in managing the reorientation of our debt into a more manageable space as we move forward. It puts us in a good situation in terms of the ongoing position of how we manage our finances over the next number of months. Does Mr. McCarthy have something he wants to add?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	81	Let me just add one or two figures. In 2020, which is what the Deputy was asking about-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	83	-----most of the debt was taken on in and around 0%. It obviously differed from debt instrument to debt instrument, but the vast majority of debt was at 0%. This was because the European Central Bank, ECB, and the Central Bank of Ireland to be more particular, was essentially backstopping debt issues in all euro area member states - quantitative easing, so to speak. That continued in 2021 as the ECB continued to hoover up much of the additional debt issuance. However, that is now being discontinued. We are moving from quantitative easing to a quantitative tightening space. The cost of borrowing, which was 1.7% this morning, has risen substantially.

Okay. I am conscious of time and I have five minutes left. On Irish Water, the establishment cost was approximately €180 million in 2013.I note that in June 2020, amounts totalling €372 million were issued from the Central Fund to Irish Water under a loan agreement. What are the terms of that agreement and how much has Irish Water cost the Exchequer to date?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	87	I have a detailed note on that and I will give the Deputy some of the figures from it. The individual facilities under the Minister's facility agreement, which was signed on 24 June, were as follows: facility 1 - €127 million committed; facility 2 - €111 million for 2019 non-domestic borrowing; facility 3 - €133 million committed for 2020 non-domestic borrowing; facility 4 - €160 million uncommitted for 2021 non-domestic borrowing; facility 5 - €146 million uncommitted for 2022 non-domestic borrowing; facility 6 - €184 million uncommitted for 2023 non-domestic borrowing; and facility 7 - €204 million uncommitted for 2024 non-domestic borrowing. For facilities 1 to 3, inclusive, covering pre-2019 spending, that is, historical non-domestic borrowing, together with 2019 and 2020, there was a total of €371 million. Facility 4 was subsequently committed and drawn down in 2021-----

I turn now to the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme. On the face of it, that scheme was extremely well received and it was really important to businesses. I understand the terms of the scheme included a maximum provision of up to €2 billion. What is the current value of loans drawn down under the scheme? How many applicants are estimated to have applied and how many received funding?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	91	The scheme was operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, as the Deputy probably knows, on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. As he rightly said, it offered funding of up to €2 billion. The latest figures we have indicate it has delivered €563 million to more than 8,000 SMEs. The scheme is due to end in line with the EU temporary state aid framework in June 2022.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	95	The details I gave are the ones we are in a position to give at this stage, which are those relating to the position to the end of December 2020. The actual accounts are produced on an annual basis and while I think they are being finalised at the moment, they still have to be considered and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. In fairness, I understand the details of the 2021 position cannot be disclosed until then.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	97	The only thing I can say around all of this is that what we have noted through the 2020 period is a decline in the value of the fund, which is very much linked to the negative interest rate environment.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	98	Would there be an impact on the State if the fund continues to lose value?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	99	No, the agreement that was reached with Apple is that the pot is the pot at the end of the day, if I can describe it that way. Whatever is there, whether it is above or below, whoever emerges at the end as the holder of the fund benefits from the entirety of the fund.

On legal costs, I note that costs of €439,000 were awarded and the Department's legal costs, at €510,000, were greater than that. There were two settlements paid out in 2019 totalling €24 million. I recently put in a parliamentary question about all the various State Claims Agency amounts between 2016 and 2021. I understood the Department had claims amounting to €134 million during that period. Am I right in saying there were five in 2020?

The figure of €438,000 was in regard to the costs associated with the Supreme Court case, as I mentioned earlier, which was to do with the disabled drivers scheme appeal.

In fact, I am not sure whether congratulations are in order but we will see as time goes on. I have a number of quick-fire questions. The first relates to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which I know is an independent office. I have been in receipt of some complaints in regard to the performance of the ombudsman and the length of time it takes to get a response from the office. Is Mr. Hogan aware of these issues? What oversight does he perform in terms of the ombudsman's role?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	109	There is a very strong interaction between members of the banking division and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which involves continuous contact. I am not aware of any particular complaints about the office. There is one thing we are doing this year that probably is relevant to the issue the Deputy raised. We are committed to undertaking a periodic critical review of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. This year, we are doing it on the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.

I have not made a complaint but I really feel constituents should not have to come to a Deputy to get an answer from the ombudsman. I will reserve my position until I see how it goes. The office has responded to me but I can see from what has been passed to me that it has not been responding to certain individuals.

I concur with my colleague, Deputy Carthy, regarding primary medical certificates. This is a huge issue for people. Mobility is a big concern for anyone, particularly in rural Ireland, where it is much more difficult to get around. We do not have public transport and there is no access from a disability perspective. I will move on but I am an interested party, as they say, in this matter.

The scheme needs to be reviewed and I would support him in that. I do not know whether it is appropriate for the witnesses to address it but the scheme certainly needs to be reviewed. There are a lot of dependent people impacted by it. How does Ireland compare on an EU scale, on a per capita basis, in terms of our national debt?

In that case, people's standard of living falls. The cost of living has risen so much that people leave their jobs. Now the Exchequer is paying an increased social welfare bill. How can that be correlated?

The reduction in excise that Mr. Hogan mentioned had virtually no impact because fuel has not come down further in price. It is still at the rate it was. We have reduced VAT on goods such as coal and heating oil. That will have no impact, particularly in rural Ireland.

The Deputy asked about the effects on the Exchequer. Would it be helpful to frame that question in the following way? Let us say, for example, there was a 10% or 15% reduction in the excise take on a given fuel, what would that mean in terms of loss to the Exchequer? Would that be a helpful way to frame that question?

I understand that the EU is involved when it comes to reducing VAT. There is no such permission required when it comes to excise.

As the Chair said, perhaps we could consider a 10% reduction. At the level of excise we charge, there is plenty of scope.

In terms of the effects on price, the big concerns relate to the fact that the cost of diesel, which always cost 7% or 8% less than petrol, has now exceeded the cost of petrol. That is having a particular effect on the commercial sector. There is a question in that regard. I am not sure if measures can be taken in that area. We might come back to that point later.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	194	There was always a gap between the cost of diesel and petrol. We reduced the excise on petrol by 20 cent per litre and on diesel by 15 cent per litre. The committee members probably noticed over the years that as part of the tax strategy group, we often considered how to equalise diesel and petrol prices. It seems to have happened.

I want to cover the area of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC. The amalgamation of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide was the biggest liquidation in the history of the State and we are still talking about it all these years later. On the remaining assets, the briefing document informed us that in July 2021 the loan portfolio was €3.4 billion. Has anything relating to the war in Ukraine had any impact on that in terms of assets that might be in other jurisdictions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	205	We are a little sensitive about being completely open on the location of some of the assets. If the Deputy wants a more detailed discussion on this, we could have it in private session. A number of assets are outstanding and need to be worked through by the special liquidators. As she is probably aware, there is a revised timeline for the completion of the special liquidators' job, which recognises a number of issues, predominantly Covid, but the change in the international environment has also impacted and inputted into that discussion or consideration by the liquidators.

The par value of the remaining loan portfolio is €3.4 billion. That is the value of the loan associated with it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	213	The Deputy is referring to the €35 billion loan equity that went into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, which were merged into IBRC. What the liquidators have been doing since the liquidation commenced in 2013 is realising the assets. As the Secretary General said, we have €3.4 billion at par value of assets left to sell. We have disclosed there are 12 assets left to sell. There has been a delay to the timeline because these assets are primarily in the hospitality space and, with the advent of Covid two years ago, it is not the right time to sell hotel and pub assets. The decision was made to extend the timeline to try to realise the best possible return for the State.

Getting title to the assets over the last number of years has proven difficult. That is why it has taken so long in terms of not being able to sell them previously. We now have a clear line of sight-----

Again, the costs around litigation are something we discuss with the liquidators on a monthly basis. I can update some of those figures because the liquidators have made pretty good progress. At the end of February, and these are the latest figures I have, the 17 has been reduced to six and the 12 has been reduced to ten. Recovery and enforcement is ten. That is 16 outstanding from 29 previously.

There was always an expectation that the outworking of this was going to be costly. Is there an adjustment on that in the context of the progress that was made? The up-to-date figure is from 3 March this year. It would be very useful to go into private session if the officials will not or cannot answer in public session. It is important for us to get some sort of a sense of exactly what the timeline and likelihood is of retrieving some of these assets.

On electric vehicles and hybrids, we were told last week in a reply from the Department of Finance that there is a target of 100,000 vehicles by 2030, which goes back to the point I asked Mr. McCarthy about. We were told it was really a market function. We know there are grants for vehicles under a certain size. What analysis has been done of the prospect of people moving over? Is the 100,000 just picked out of the air as a target? Is there an analysis of people's ability in respect of the production of these vehicles, their cost effectiveness and all of that?

My opening comments to Mr. McCarthy related to the potential fines if we do not meet those targets. They will come back and we will be looking at them in the Department of Finance accounts. I thought there would have been some rigorous analysis of whether the 100,000 target was viable. That is why I am trying to find out what relationship there is and what potential fines we might incur.

In fact, I was surprised to see the number. I thought the big investment would be in public transport. It has a potential impact if it is an unrealistic target. I want to know what kind of rigour goes into setting those targets and what relationship the Department has with that because, as I said, it ends up in these accounts we have been looking at.

I am not sure what we have in writing around it but the Deputy can rest assured that there was quite a bit of interaction. On climate more generally, the Department has created its own climate economy group to look at all these issues as to how the targets that have been agreed will impact right across the economy. Mr. McCarthy chairs it. It will be a very important stream of work for us over the next months and years.

I thank the officials for coming in. It is great to see them again. Last week, the Department of Justice was before the committee and one thing we went through was the transposition of the anti-money laundering directive, which I think was a European directive of 2015 ultimately was transposed in 2019. The State was exposed to a €2 million fine as a consequence of the two-year delay in its transposition. It was supposed to be done in 2017. The reason I raise it is twofold. First, it seemed to me that there needed to be interaction with the Department of Finance in the development of legislation to transpose the directive. What was the situation there? Will Mr. Hogan speak on that? Is there anything else we need to be concerned about in relation to delays or fines related to the transposition of directives? I am coming to this in a slightly odd way that Mr. Hogan may not have prepared for but for my second question, is there further legislation or are there other EU directives that require transposition around money laundering? Can the Department speak on anything around that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	244	The anti-money laundering agenda has been ongoing for quite some years at EU level. The directives very much set the context in which we transpose the rules that are made at European level.
#JenniferCarrollMacNeill	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-party	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-dob	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	245	We are also involved in developing them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	246	We are very much involved in that. A new package was agreed on 20 July 2021. It has four elements. There is new regulation that will collectively replace the current fifth anti-money laundering directive. There is a new directive itself, a sixth one, a revised funds transfer regulation and a regulation establishing a new central supervisor for anti-money laundering matters at EU level. Anti-money laundering touches quite a number of areas. The Deputy rightly identified the Department of Justice as being part of it. There is very strong co-ordination through the anti-money laundering committee which our Department chairs and which has representatives from the different areas across the State where anti-money laundering and terrorist financing issues arise. Sometimes transposition can be difficult and can touch on different Departments. We do co-ordinate across the different bodies. I think that anything the Department needs to do is up to date but I will double-check and if there is anything to the contrary we will come back on it. We are very conscious that when we are transposing regulations, we do so correctly. We are especially mindful when it might touch on other areas that we are cognisant of what the impact might be.

I suppose the concern from the committee's perspective was that there was such a large fine, that it was an unusual thing and there was, as Mr. Hogan says, a series of anti-money laundering directives. In our dialogue with the Department of Justice, it indicated that it can be difficult to keep up and that there was directive after directive in relation to it. It generated concern here because "difficult to keep up" is not where we want to be. First, we are engaged at European level in the development of much of the technical detail behind the directives so we are already in it and it is not a surprise when it comes out that it somehow has to be transposed. There really is not a reason for ongoing delays and fines accruing as a consequence when we are engaged in the policy development in the first instance. Is it fair to say that we are engaged and that we have sight of them?

Therefore is there any other difficulty? What we are concerned about, particularly in the last ten weeks with the exposure from Russia and the concerns around financing and money laundering generally, is that we are at the top of our game on this and not, as we have been for the last six years, coming behind and paying fines.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	252	It is fair to say that we have had to invest quite a bit of effort in meeting the regulations and the standards that are expected on that. We have certainly closed that gap, to be frank. We have been extremely active on financial sanctions over the last months as a result of the war in Ukraine. The package of sanctions has emerged at a European level, sometimes at extraordinary speed. We have been very conscious of our obligations at international level to move quickly to transpose those and we have done them successfully.

The Central Bank also has a role in the financial sector and is very active.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	258	As far as I am aware, there certainly is a lot of interaction in relation to it but I might come back to the Deputy on the precise detail of how that works.

I thank Mr. Hogan. There are some general questions and there is general ill-ease. I received a very good response back from the Department of Finance, which is worth putting on the record. It relates to securitisation and the exposure of the financial market generally to Russian assets. Mr. Hogan may correct me if I am wrong but the Department told me that at the end of 2021, Russian assets represented only 0.1% of the on- and off-balance sheet financial assets and liabilities held by Irish authorised banks, that is, €1.7 billion, 0.3% of total assets of authorised investment funds, or €11.5 billion, and 0.1% of the total insurance sector assets of €97 million. I think the Department also gave me numbers in relation to the special purpose entities, SPEs, that just under 2% of the 3,000 special purpose entities, which of course are totally legitimate entities, had been identified as having links to Russia and that it was currently estimated that one in three of those, that is, 17 SPEs being 0.5% of the total SPE population was directly linked to individuals in the scope of the sanctions regime.  It seems to be a contained exposure; I do not want to say that it is small. What are the Department's concerns on this as we move forward? Particularly, as I asked about the enforcement of sanctions that have been imposed by the EU.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	260	The important thing for us was to put the sanctions regime that was expected of us internationally in place. We have done that successfully. The figures there are reviews that were undertaken by the Central Bank. It has a strong interaction as a result of the details that it gets from the 3,000 SPEs in Ireland in relation to their background and so on. I think there is strong, rigorous oversight on that. The information flow can give the committee some comfort that the interaction conducted by the Central Bank has been successful in identifying the scope and exposure there. As this unfolds, if there are additional requirements at EU level we will react to them at the same speed as we have done over the past number of months.

It is useful, as Mr. Hogan says, that they can be identified, let us hope that is the universe of that, to individuals linked to the sanction regime. I suppose my question is what comes next? How can we be sure of enforcement? That is really what I want to know.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	262	The mechanism around enforcement is with the Central Bank there. There is another aspect which is interesting. It is not only national but also transnational in that at EU level on 7 March, member states were advised that the European Commission had launched its whistleblower tool so if individuals identified that there are challenges and issues there, that can be raised there. There are various mechanisms where the correct assessment of this would be monitored and enforced.

That potential has been identified by the Central Bank, has been identified in the numbers which the Deputy correctly cited and which I have in my briefing document here. To the extent that a risk exists in this space, I think we have corralled and identified it. We will continue to ensure that as our understanding evolves as to what the expectation is internationally, we adapt and monitor the situation.

My colleague Deputy Carthy asked some questions about this. I understand that following the Supreme Court case, the Department undertook to put in place a technical legislative change which basically had no effect on the criteria required to obtain a primary medical certificate. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	275	What happened was that the provisions of the scheme were set out in the statutory instrument on the basis of the legal advice we received or set out in the primary legislation. Our imperative at that stage was to facilitate a mechanism that the scheme would and should continue as it was constructed but subject to our conducting or being in a position to conduct a review as to what the future path should be. I outlined to Deputy Carthy earlier two aspects of the work on this which are really important. One is to define a mechanism, that we have a scheme in place operating at a primary level through the HSE and that we have an appeals mechanism. Work is advancing on that. Equally there is the wider consideration of the appropriate mechanism to support people who have a disability and need to access State intervention in the mobility space. That work is ongoing in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

There had been some dialogue with the medical board of appeal on the scheme itself and how best to bring it forward. We are always conscious that in reviewing a scheme like this - as I said, this had been in existence since the 1960s - the nature of the parameters surrounding the scheme were quite tightly defined and that in essence-----

In parallel, as I said to Deputy Carthy earlier, we have an information-gathering group, if I can describe it that way, to look at best practice internationally in terms of how states support work in this area.

My next question is on Home Building Finance Ireland. Why was taxpayers' money used by Home Building Finance Ireland to fund the construction of private rental properties that were sold directly to cuckoo funds?

Home Building Finance Ireland has played an important role in providing additional moneys and support for different aspects of this.

Some 83% of all properties constructed under the Home Building Finance Ireland momentum fund were private rental apartments, all of which were sold to institutional investors, to pre-agreed contacts. Has Mr. Hogan expressed concern about this at the quarterly meetings?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	305	I ask Mr. Carville to come in on that one.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	306	The Deputy may not be aware that I sit on the board of Home Building Finance Ireland. I was the interim chair when it was set up. Some 43% of the homes funded were owner-occupier homes. If the momentum fund is excluded, it can be looked at in the round. The momentum fund, as the Deputy will probably recall from what Ms Deering said, is now closed for business. It was closed at the end of last year. There was a particular reason for bringing that into the product offering. The idea behind Home Building Finance Ireland is that where there are market gaps, we are meant to be agile and flexible and bring in products that are useful. When they are no longer useful and no longer needed, the products are removed from our product suite.

#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	309	When it was before the Committee of Public Accounts last month, Home Building Finance Ireland confirmed that the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment under the scheme would be €1,800 per month. It would be €2,100 for a two-bedroom apartment and - wait for it - €3,100 for a three-bedroom apartment. One has to ask the question, who the hell are these apartments for? Is the taxpayer financing the distortion of the market with these ridiculously high rents we are subsidising? That question has to be asked.

What would happen if the momentum fund did not fund those apartments? Where would those people who are living in those apartments rent?

It comes back again to the distortion of the market. The Department said earlier that its remit was to avoid distorting the market. My question is about taxpayers funding the distortion of the market when we have to subsidise it.

Home Building Finance Ireland has approved 71 different facilities since commencement in January 2019. That covers some larger schemes, and a plethora of smaller builders. There is a specific product for sub-ten units, which was a new product we introduced during the course of its life. We funded projects in 20 counties. We have an active team out on the road trying to promote Home Building Finance Ireland as a viable source of funding.

That is not a number I am familiar with. I could take that away and have a look at it, but I am not even sure how one would calculate a figure like that, just off the top of my head. That would be my response to that. Let me have a look at the transcript to see what Ms Deering actually said.

I thank our witnesses for appearing before the committee. Recognising the importance of the Department of Finance, in particular, to the economy, I acknowledge that extraordinarily difficult work has been done by so many civil servants working on this brief trying to keep businesses and the economy afloat during Covid. Credit is due in this regard. Let me refer to the primary issue I would like to raise. The gross national debt in 2020 stood at approximately €220 billion. What we are starting to see, and as alluded to in reports today by Bloomberg, is a rise in interest rates in the UK and, potentially, the eurozone. In terms of the debt in Ireland and inflation at a scale that has not been seen in many decades, what is the exposure when it comes to the change in interest rates? The Secretary General or perhaps the chief economist, Mr. McCarthy, might like to answer that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	335	I will start and then hand over to Mr. McCarthy. Early in the session I referred to our annual debt report, which is a very useful document, which is almost a handbook. on the national debt, exposure and what it means in terms of our own public finances and so on. Over the past number of years, there has been significant reprofiling and elongating of our debt. Associated with that, by virtue of benefiting from the lower-interest-rate environment, there has been the material impact on the cost of servicing the debt. As we look into the near and middle term, we are generally well placed to deal with the issues that are now arising, but, as we have stated in our own public documents over the past number of years, the very benign environment that has been operating internationally on bond yields, very much driven by central bank action, is beginning to come to an end. We have seen a movement on interest rates in the US, of which I am sure the Deputy will be very much aware.In the European context, the ECB has already indicated some of the policy actions it intends to take over the coming while. They are very much linked to the winding down of asset programmes that have been instrumental in terms of the moderation of the international lending environment. However, what might have been described as an era of free or more-than-free money is very much coming to an end. We have been mindful of it. We have been indicating it in our documentation over recent years and have been planning accordingly. Mr. McCarthy had a number this morning where the bond yield had moved to 1.7%.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	336	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	337	The direction of travel from where we are at this stage is very clear. The re-profiling and elongating of debt that is being conducting by the NTMA over recent years has put us in a good position. It is very different from where we were in 2013. As the Deputy might remember then, we were very much the story then, but we are in a much better position on the international debt markets and seen very much as part of the semi-core group of nations. Our bond yields trade very closely to Belgium and France at present. We would have envisaged and experienced quite a different scenario ten years ago. Does Mr. McCarthy want to add to that?
#JamesOConnor	unknown-#JamesOConnor-party	unknown-#JamesOConnor-dob	unknown-#JamesOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	338	I suppose Mr. Hogan understands the luxury of time is not necessarily a commodity I have in great supply and I have to cut Mr. Hogan off. We are in a situation where we know that, in 2020, the NTMA and the Department of Finance were involved in the procurement of approximately €26 billion in borrowing. We are now facing into very uncertain economic times with the war in Ukraine which has the potential to do significantly more damage to the economy than Covid, which is pretty hard to believe, when it comes to the increase in the cost of oil and other seriously important commodities that are vital to the running of an island economy such as Ireland that does not have access to many raw materials as such. What does the Oireachtas need to do to enable the Department to get over the next 18 months, which look to be incredibly unpredictable? It is quite worrying. One area on which there could be a very serious knock-on impact is our corporation tax if profits were to drop as a consequence of ever-increasing costs of supplying companies. That is something I hear on the ground from business people and SMEs throughout the country. I am sure the same could be said further up the ladder. We will see that later in the year in terms of when companies' profits are returned. I assume corporation tax is one of the areas that will be very badly impacted by the war and by supply issues in terms of companies facing increasing challenges as they try to get goods and services moved. They show that the Irish economy is extraordinarily exposed to some ongoing international issues, especially around the war in Ukraine. What work is the Department undertaking when it comes to trying to make the economy bulletproof to some degree? I know it is not entirely possible to do that. I would like some reassurances from the Secretary General in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	339	The Deputy mentioned the Oireachtas support for the work we do. It is forums such as this, where we can articulate the kind of considerations that we bring to bear when we look at how the public finances will be shaped over the coming years, that are useful mechanisms for bringing many of these issues to the fore. Last night the Committee on Budgetary Oversight met with the Minister, and Mr. McCarthy was there as well, in terms of the outline of our forecast in the stability programme update. That is a good segue for Mr. McCarthy to talk shortly about how we see things unfolding over the next while. The Deputy rightly mentioned the corporation tax piece. Some of the issues to which he alluded are very relevant but so too is the international tax reform agenda. The Deputy will be quite aware that over recent years at the OECD at international level there has been a very strong focus on international corporation tax reform. We have been very much a part of that debate. We have been mindful from the very early stages that there would be a likely cost of whatever would emerge as a result of the latest base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process at OECD level and how that might impact on our public finances. Our planning has accordingly been shaped by those considerations. Does Mr. McCarthy want to add to that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	340	I will add to it very briefly. Within the stability programme we have revised down our forecast for this year. We are projecting modified domestic demand, which is our preferred measure of economic activity, of approximately 4.25% for this year. At the time of the budget we were talking about 6.5%. Over the medium term we see the economy has the capacity to grow by approximately 3% to 3.5%. What is the Government doing in terms of trying to build resilience etc? My view is we are probably living in a more shock-prone world at this stage. Already since the start of this decade we have had a global pandemic, war on European soil and we have a much slower moving but nonetheless significant shock, namely, Brexit. Government is trying to build buffers to be able to address those shocks over time. The key innovations were set out in the summer economic statement last year. Government is setting budgetary policy within a medium-term framework and setting spending within the trend growth rate of revenue but also, within that, ramping up its public capital programme. It is spending €12 billion to €13 billion per annum. Only a decade ago, if I was sitting here, we would be talking about spending €4 billion per annum on capital. It is boosting the supply side, addressing bottlenecks and ensuring Ireland remains attractive using all that public capital programme. Of course, it is not all in physical infrastructure. It is in human capital as well because that will increasingly be a part of Ireland's attractiveness in years to come. That sort of macro framework is how Government is trying to build up resilience and build up buffers to this more shock-prone economy we are in.

I want go back to the IBRC very quickly and I will not deal with anything we will touch on in private session. I want to clarify something, because in some of the correspondence we received in our briefing from October and December 2021, there was a suggestion that the revised timeline or a review of that timeline would be laid before the Department of Finance at the end of quarter 1 of 2022. Is that the case?

Moving on, and I apologise again for bouncing around, as it were, action 76 of the Climate Action Plan 2021 is around the issue of sovereign green bonds. There seems to be a commitment in action 76 to the Department of Finance and the NTMA meeting regularly to look at the issue of sovereign green bonds. Do we have an update on that? Is that happening? How often have they met? I know the NTMA is probably the lead there.

In another committee where we sometimes look at tax expenditures, it seems that a significant proportion of tax expenditures are not regularly reviewed. It is in the region of 23%. Are there plans to take the entirety of tax expenditures and examine them as a whole? I refer to tax schemes that have not been reviewed recently.

The 23% the Deputy referred to includes things that would almost be part of the normal course of our tax system, whether income tax reliefs and so on.

Equally, sometimes this even goes in a different direction. As part of the tax strategy group, TSG, papers, which again I think the Deputy receives, there is consideration in more general terms of different expenditures that might fall outside the 75% or 76% looked at as part of the process. Therefore, we have different mechanisms with which we undertake this process. The tax strategy group is-----

We are extremely cognisant of the different reliefs that exist in this context. Some of those are part of the structure of our tax system and come under consideration when the Minister is thinking about adjusting income tax bands or whatever it might be as part of the normal budgetary process. There is an awareness that tax expenditures have a cost to the Exchequer and to the public finances. The review of those tax expenditures, as I said, is structural and is probably a bit more routine than might be expected.

A great deal of work was done on gender equality budgeting during the last Government. While we seem to be moving into a phase where we will apply this to spending decisions and budgets, hopefully, is there an expectation that we would do the same with tax expenditures?

I refer to data and access to information. For those of us who do not have a degree in economics, I learned a new phrase this week, which is "the walk between Exchequer spending and Government spending". Apparently, all economists know what this means and I have now learned what it means. When I learned this, it sounded to me like the Department has a table somewhere which has all the detailed information on the walk between Exchequer spending and Government spending. Can I please have that table?

Turning to the issue of the State's holdings in the various financial institutions, I understand that more AIB shares are being offloaded by the State. It was also announced before Christmas that the State would offload approximately 15% of its holdings over time. Regarding the cost to the State on day one and the potential return over the next three years, has the Department examined this aspect for Permanent TSB and AIB? In the context of the uncertainty of the market now, is a plan set out in this regard? I ask the witnesses to outline where we are with trying to recoup some of the moneys put in some ten or 12 years ago.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	415	I will address this question first, and then I will let Mr. Carville take over. When we invested in the three banks, namely, the Bank of Ireland, AIB and PTSB, from 2009 to 2011, a total of approximately €29.4 billion was invested.Up to 8 April, the date on which the current Bank of Ireland trading plan was extended, some €19.8 billion had been recovered in cash by disposal, investment income and liability guarantee fees. On the investment made in the banks at this particular time and where we are now, the divestment has probably gone a little slower than we might have anticipated. Things have moved in a particular direction in markets over the past number of years that were not particularly favourable but we have managed to divest. I think the most recent one was 2017 where approximately 25% of the shares in AIB were divested. We have taken the opportunity through the Bank of Ireland trading plan and the AIB trading plan to make divestments in a controlled way over the past while. The buyback this morning is a kind of commercial and market decision taken by the bank. It will have some benefit for the State itself.

The figure the Deputy is looking for as of this morning is approximately €4.6 billion of a gap between the €29.4 billion that went in and the cash we have received whether by way of fees, dividends, share sales. As the Secretary General said, in 2017, we sold €3.4 billion worth of stock. It was the second largest initial public offering, IPO, of stock in the world that year. We took advantage of market conditions at that point in time. Our shareholding in Bank of Ireland has gone from-----

If we decided in the morning to sell everything we have in all the banks then we would be down €4.6 billion in real terms.

This morning AIB announced two things. One was a dividend, so we will get 70% of that dividend of €122 million. The bank also announced a market buyback so we will benefit from that as well.

Would the State not be better off holding on on the basis it will now get an annual dividend, assuming the bank continues to trade in a profitable manner?

Our job is maximise value for the taxpayer but also to reduce the shareholdings to zero in a carefully controlled manner, so there is a trade-off between selling shares at a price today-----

Why is there not a benefit for the State in having an input? The banks took major decisions the State had very little control over and then the taxpayers ended up being the net losers and the people had to bail them out. Why should we walk away and let them have a free hand without having some input in the long term?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	436	There are a couple of points to make there. First, looking at it from a purely financial perspective, it would take decades to recoup the full value of what we invested in the living banks by way of dividend. It would take decades to get that cash back. The second point is on influence over the banks. We have EU-mandated or Directorate-General for Competition, DG COMP-mandated relationship frameworks with the banks, so commercial decisions are for the banks and for the management and boards of the banks. Our influence is very limited to nil as a result.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	437	Okay. On the shareholding we now have, is that going to be adversely affected in any way by the withdrawal of the Ulster Bank and KBC Bank from the market? Are we going to be in a more challenging position as a result of their withdrawal?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	438	I suppose from an investor point of view, were I an international investor thinking of buying shares in the Irish banking market, I would first need to understand why these two banks had decided to exit. Very quickly I would realise there are benefits for the remaining banks in terms of their buying some of the assets the departing banks are selling. KBC's assets are being sold primarily to Bank of Ireland and the Ulster Bank assets are going to both PTSB and, it seems, AIB. Certainly its corporate book is. Its tracker book looks like it is heading in that direction as well. It improves the viability of the remaining banks because they are larger so their costs are spread over a larger base.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	439	Okay. I move on to one other area. The Exchequer figures for the end of April show a substantial increase in tax. I am aware that is taking into account that there was a reduction because of the Covid lockdowns, etc. I raise long-term planning and one of the problems we had in 2008 and 2009. Other countries do long-term planning where there is a fund built up that the state can dig into in the event of there being a recession. For argument's sake, if we had had such a fund available in 2008 and 2009 there would have been many things we could have done to keep projects going. In 2008 and 2009 when the crisis hit, it was locked down completely. Is there any long-term plan for dealing with that in view of the fact tax levels are extremely good?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	440	What we recognise in that contribution is the potential around the rainy day fund. Mr. McCarthy might want to talk a little about that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	441	If I recall correctly, 2018 was the last time the Exchequer or public finances moved into surplus and the Minister enacted a rainy day fund. He put it in place with the intention of doing exactly as the Deputy said. It was a fund to enable us to support the economy if it were subject to a major shock. Maybe it was 2019. I cannot remember the exact date. Of course, straight after the legislation was put on the Statute Book, Covid kicked in. We had been anticipating a surplus but it went massively in the opposite direction for obvious reasons. We are still running a deficit, so even though the position is improving we are still anticipating a general government deficit of approximately €2 billion for this year. The Minister's view, which I think is correct, is there is no point in borrowing to put money in a fund. In other words, when you are running a deficit you do not establish or capitalise a rainy day fund.

It is thus at a disadvantage. I am just wondering about that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	446	Mr. McCarthy should be brief.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	447	It is a valid question. We must set that against borrowing at 1.7%, which is the rate as of this morning. That would be the cost of establishing a rainy day fund. Second, the Government has already borrowed a huge amount during and for Covid so we have cash sitting in the NTMA, etc., of approximately €30 billion. There are a huge amount of liquid assets that could be called if the economy was subjected to a shock.

I raise the issue of the credit unions. The savings in credit unions went up by 2.8% in 2021.At the end of last year there was a surplus of €17 billion in the credit unions. I am raising this in the context of the housing crisis. The credit union movement has indicated at different times that it would like to try to help with the housing problem because it has a co-operative ethos. We are unusual in European terms in that many other countries have community-owned banks and publicly owned banks, such as Germany, for example. Here, we have the credit union movement sitting beside the big players like AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, etc. Last year, 69% of new mortgages came from three banks, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB. The credit union is in a bind. It can only lend up to 3% of total mortgages and 10% of total SME borrowing. It is caught at 3% while the three pillar banks were at 69% last year. The banks' SME lending was 90% of all SME lending whereas the credit union was restricted to below 10%. What is happening there? For nearly as long I have been around there has been talk of reforming the credit union to allow them to play more of a role in this area. It appears to me, and to some others who keep an eye on these things, that there is heavy lobbying from the banks in this regard. There may be some bias - perhaps "bias" is too strong a word - in that we look favourably on the banks and let them do all of it. After the past 12 or 14 years we have learned a thing or two about the banks and the things we took for granted. There was a saying when I was a bit younger that something was as good as money in the bank, but we know now that money in the bank is not always good. Why are we restricting the credit union movement? It wants to get involved here. Money is needed for affordable housing, there are people who cannot get mortgages and schemes that cannot be funded and there is €17 billion sitting there.

The point about viability is a brilliant point and well made. It is of great concern to us because we have policy responsibility for the credit union sector.

If a bank or credit union has €100 million, it can afford to lend €50 million because even if every debtor defaulted, it would still have €50 million. Look at what the banks did in the 2000s, for God's sake. The credit unions did not do it, by and large. The credit unions were stable.

The way to make a return is by lending and making a margin on the lending versus the deposit base or funding cost. That equation is wrong. Either credit unions have to lend more or interest rates need to increase, which brings me to the Chairman's second point. There is a viability question if this trend continues in the longer term. We must not forget that there are 220 individual credit unions and they all have different risk appetites and membership profiles and so on. It is not a homogenous group. Within that, there are definitely some credit unions that have the risk appetite and the wherewithal to do more SME lending and mortgage lending. There are limits set by the Central Bank, which is independent of us, but when credit unions start coming towards their limits, they can apply for an extension to those limits. Many credit unions that are hitting their limits have done that. Not every credit union wants to do SME lending or mortgage lending. On engagement and lobbying, my team spends an awful lot of time with the sector and meeting individual credit unions. There were two people with the Minister of State at the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, conference recently. We talk extensively to the sector to try to find out what is happening behind the scenes and on the ground. We are very receptive to the representative bodies talking to us at any stage. They are well represented in that regard.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	468	It is just under 100%. For credit unions, it is 26%. The figure I had for last year was 27% but we will settle on 26%, which is about a quarter. We are talking about viability. There is a pot of money there of €17 billion. I am not advocating crazy lending like the banks did in the 2000s. Around 50% would seem like a safe bet because the assets would be there even if everybody defaulted and everything went belly-up. The credit unions have had their hands tied behind their backs and a blindfold or a bag pulled over their heads. They are suffocated and prevented from getting into the mortgage market. A credit union with €70 million to lend can only do 14 mortgages at €250,000 each. That is all it can do. In other countries like Canada, Australia or the USA, there is more of a level playing field. Those are not exactly communist states or anything like that. We are talking about America, for God's sake. They seem to be able to allow the credit unions to play a bigger role. The witnesses advise the Government on these policy decisions. There is a need to move this issue on because it has been going on for years. When we were caught in the middle of the recession and just starting to emerge from it, everybody was scratching their heads and asking what to do about housing. The credit unions said they wanted to intervene and help. I have a letter here from a local credit union saying that due to the regulatory caps being imposed and the regulations on the ability to provide mortgages, the cap is 7.5% of assets in business and home loans, so it is effectively stopped before it starts. This credit union has assets of €67 million and 7.5% of that is €4.9 million. Its existing business and home loan book amounts to just over €2 million. It has potential for a lot more. With the value of an average mortgage being €250,000, this credit union has the potential to give out only nine mortgages in total. It seems the credit union movement is being held back. The witnesses may not be able to give me a detailed answer to this question but do the banks lobby the Department of Finance very heavily on these matters? The witnesses may have only been in their roles a short time, but do they know what the situation has been over the years? Is there a lot of lobbying from the pillar banks - the banks we bailed out?

The limits are imposed on credit unions and, indeed, the banks by the regulator. As Mr. Carville has outlined, we are also mindful that there is an opportunity for the credit union movement to play a greater role in this area. Depending on the credit union, there may be an appetite to do that. That is why the Minister of State commissioned the policy review. He has had much engagement and interaction with different stakeholders around the credit union movement on this. The public consultation exercise is now closed but if we are thinking about how to move forward, it could come down to legislative amendments to allow for more collaborative work between credit unions and other partners. It could allow for widening of products that credit unions have the opportunity to offer. In that environment there could also be more focused governance. All of that is in play.

I have asked the question twice about lobbying. Is there much lobbying from the banks and the banking sector in general? For example, does the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, lobby the Department on who should or should not be doing home lending over years? How have we arrived at a position where €17 billion cannot be touched and credit unions can only loan up to a maximum of 3% of the mortgage market? How have we arrived at that?

They can see where I am coming from with this. The figures are astonishing. We want safe lending; we do not want people to go mad, as some did in the noughties.

The Central Bank imposed a fine of €10.8 million on the Bank of New York Mellon, which is the agent for Ireland's escrow fund. What steps have either the Department or the NTMA taken in response to that fine?

What work does the Department do in the regulation of banks or companies that would essentially be in receipt of very beneficial contracts? They would essentially be State contracts. What role does the Department play in that regard?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	486	In any of those cases, we have public procurement exercises that we undertake.

To be very brief on that matter, is it fair to say in respect of fines or any of these issues, the Department is not necessarily proactive but rather it depends on information provided from others, whether it is the company or elsewhere.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	489	The information relates to historical matters and if something arose during the course of an engagement with a firm, we would be very proactive. I could not prejudge what might transpire. It clearly depends on the circumstances. Believe me when I say that we would be proactive.

I went through our earlier exchange on the pension fund. Essentially, €1 billion of additional taxpayers' money will be spent on a company that was privatised in 1999. This is a significant issue in the context of the public finances. It is referenced in chapter 1 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and it is listed as an item on today's agenda. To be frank, I do not understand why Mr. Hogan cannot provide more information on oversight and developments in that regard. Is it just the case the Irish taxpayers will be bearing the brunt of €1 billion because of an historical misstep, as we have heard before in the committee? Are we going to find out how we ended up in this position?

Issues like competitiveness are multifaceted and depend upon so many things. From a macro perspective, what we or Government are doing is trying to remain attractive for businesses to be able to make a profit, etc., and for investment to locate in Ireland. That comes back to the €12 billion or €13 billion per annum being spent on the national development plan, on continuing to invest in skills, etc., and on ensuring our corporation tax, as part of base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, developments and all of those sorts of international changes still mean Ireland is an attractive place to do business. Ultimately, we want to boost productivity. Boosting productivity is how one can remain competitive while boosting wages. If one thinks of the most productive countries in the world, it is not surprising that they are the Swedens, Norways and the Switzerlands of the world. They are very competitive while also having high wages. Boosting productivity is absolutely key and one does that by investing in physical infrastructure, in human capital, etc., and I believe that is what the Government is doing.

Without any shadow of a doubt, there is nothing to stop the State reducing its carbon tax in line with Germany, or just reducing it, full stop. We are at €41 a tonne.

With the war in Ukraine, we know that very large volumes of money flow, pretty much, through the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC in Dublin. This is largely unregulated activity. The Central Bank has oversight and has identified sanctioned entities. Has this action made it to the risks register in the Department and has the Department identified this as something about which it has a concern?

We recognise that with all of these issues, Ireland’s place in the global financial market infrastructure is one which brings with it a responsibility in respect of the utmost propriety. The oversight which we see in respect of the section 110 and the special purpose entities, SPEs, and the information which is returned to the Central Bank is an important part of that process.

The former banking unit was seconded by the former Minister, Michael Noonan, by direction from him. That involved me and a number of colleagues so it did not just concern myself alone.

Somebody brought it to my attention last night as it has been updated. It is referred to as a living document and it leads to a five-year process around all of this. Mr. Carville and his team’s situation is a little bespoke, if I can describe it in those terms, in respect of the secondment arrangements which normally apply, in that it is the entire unit that has come across from the NTMA to provide that banking and financial market expertise that was well-recognised as part of the banking review, and that was so much needed in the Department.

From my previous contribution, I was told that the Department might come back to me with a note on the sovereign green bonds issue.

The cost of servicing this debt has gone down by almost €3 billion in the past five to six years because of the refinancing which we are aware has been carried out on it. This is to be welcomed.The cost of servicing the debt in 2020 was €4.67 billion. Efforts are made to refinance some of those loans when opportunities arise. Are there still opportunities to refinance some of the loans? Mr. McCarthy mentioned that the rate of borrowing is 0.7% interest. Do we currently have loans on the national debt that were borrowed at a higher rate that could be refinanced?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	564	Absolutely, that is one of the reasons, as I said to Deputy Colm Burke, that the NTMA has €30 billion. When a bond carrying 3% comes due and has to be repaid at some stage, it will then be replaced by cash which has been borrowed at 0%. So, yes, that is going on all the time.

We have mixed it in that much that we do not know now. I remember there was talk at the time in the Chamber that there was a period of decades where part of it would not be paid at all. The can was kicked down the road, so to speak. It probably made sense at the time. What I am trying to ascertain is for the public to know when we will finally be relieved of this God-forsaken burden that was loaded up on the back of the taxpayer. I would love to know, because it is an issue that has played on our minds for well over a decade. It is a question I asked, but Mr. McCarthy is telling me today that it is all mixed into the one pot. That is a pity.

I understand the witnesses do not have the information with them, but it is an issue we must address. It is better housekeeping to keep different debts separate. However, I can see the logic of mixing it all into the one, in that the debt can be refinanced at lower rates, but we should still be able to calculate it. We should have some mechanism to calculate what the hangover is from the crazy period called the Celtic tiger.

The first item is the minutes of our meeting of 28 April, which have been circulated to members. Do members wish to raise any matters in respect of the minutes? Are they agreed? Agreed. As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page. Two sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas between 25 April and 29 April 2022. I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these before opening the floor to members.

Since no member wishes to comment, can we agree and note the accounts and statements? Agreed. As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes. We will move on to correspondence. As agreed previously, items that were not flagged for discussion at the meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated. Decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee's meetings and published on the committee’s web page. The first category under which members have flagged items for discussion is correspondence from Account Officers and-or Ministers of Government and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings. No. 1205 B, correspondence from Ms Dara Deering, chief executive officer, Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, dated 21 April 2022, provides information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with HBFI on 3 March 2022. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence, except for the table on pages 1 and 2, which is provided on a confidential basis. Is that agreed? Agreed. I ask Members to avoid discussion of the table in public session. I flagged the issue. The parts of it I wanted to discuss were discussed at this morning's session with the Department of Finance - the matter was also raised by other members - regarding the high percentage of the money going from HBFI to institutional investors and finishing up in apartments. A figure of 83% of the MOMENTUM fund is finishing up in apartments that are being let by those investors and private institutions at rents very few people could afford. That is all that needs to be said on it. Do any other members wish to come in on that?

On the table, there is quite a variation in the cost. Does that include land costs by county? For example, the third most expensive one was County Waterford. It may have been what they were building or whatever. If it is an average and that was a small number, that would be different.

There certainly is a wide variation in it. We can seek that clarification. No. 1207B, correspondence from Mr. Peter Walsh, chief executive, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, dated 22 April 2022, provides further information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with TII on 3 February 2022. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy have flagged this item.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	609	Is there an international comparison with regard to the collection of tolls? If, for example, a person goes through a toll collection point and does not have a tag or whatever, the toll has to be paid by the following evening, which is when most people will do it. However, penalties arrive very quickly if, say, somebody does not get to pay the toll. How do we compare with other jurisdictions? Could TII give us some information about third-country vehicles? How does it collect the tolls, or does it collect them? The other thing I discovered from replies I received is that people overpay. It can be quite a sizeable amount of money and it goes into the revenue of the particular company. I have an issue with that.It is overpaid and really, it is not its funding. If it went into an account such as the Dormant Funds Account it could be disbursed to good causes. There is an amount set by regulation. There is something wrong about retaining more than this amount. Why should it be permitted to retain it? It is quite a sizeable amount of money in some cases. There are a number of issues further on in the document. It states it excludes the impact of Covid and current inflation uncertainty. We saw an article in one of the Sunday newspapers about it not being possible for people contracted to do a piece of work to do that work without significant losses. This report tells us it has not evaluated elements such as inflation and Covid. We need these projects and if we have to go back to square one because people do not complete the projects and down tools it will cause delay. If such a delay is on a major motorway we could lose access to a lane for example. I am not happy.

Ideally we want to see the projects done for the amount contracted. There would want to be a very good reason they would not proceed. We are starting to see points of concern that would add to the cost by virtue of the fact something is left halfway through. We saw it in a school in Naas. It cost significantly more by virtue of the fact the contractor walked off the job. The school had to get somebody in to do security. It had to go through a tender process. There were long delays. It was more expensive when it came in. There is a potential problem.

#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	613	I have a separate issue that relates to the updates provided on page 4 on major projects at pre-appraisal activity stage. Among the projects for which an update is given is the N2 Clontibret to the Border scheme. As we discussed in the hearing with TII, it has been removed from the funding allocation this year. The price range is now given at €280 million to €340 million, which is fairly broad. I have raised previously that these ranges are very broad. My big question relates to the project status, which indicates the next steps for this scheme are under consideration. Under "comments" it states very bluntly that the scheme is on hold. With regard to the official parlance it would be useful if we were to get clarification as to what, if any, distinction there is between the two comments. A document I received through freedom of information indicated this element of the road was suspended because of funding constraints and a focus on bypass and compact growth schemes. It would be useful to ask TII to provide us with details of the cost-benefit analysis carried out on various projects. Even within the funding constraints we could have issues pertaining to the level of funding allocated. Even within these there are too many questions as to why some projects are favoured above others. I have seen no rationale as to why this project would be demoted and put on hold as against others, other than political considerations, which TII told us when it came before us form a big part of the decisions it makes. It would be useful if the committee could seek details of the cost-benefit analysis carried out on these projects when deciding whether to withdraw funding from one or another.

We will note and publish the correspondence and follow-up. No. 1209 B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Health and is dated 25 April 2022. It provides information requested by the committee on the national children's hospital. Our first question concerned controls for delays and sanctions. While the contractual provisions are set out in the response it is not clear whether any damages have been paid by the contractor for failure to complete sections of the project by the agreed completion dates. We might request clarity from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. Our second question was on a potential conflict of interest but again the question is not directly answered. I propose that we request clarification from the board as to whether this potential conflict was identified or considered and, if so, whether it was addressed. In relation to the board’s analysis of the projected costs and timelines for the project, we wrote to the Department again and reiterated our request for sight of it and asked that the Department clarify whether it could be provided to the committee on a confidential basis. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence and to request the information mentioned. Is that agreed? Agreed. I propose that we seek clarification from the board as to whether damages have been paid to the contractor with regard to the agreed completion dates. We also asked for clarification from the board as to whether potential conflicts of interest were identified or considered and, if so, whether they were addressed. There is also the issue of the reply the Secretary General gave at a meeting. We raised and brought to his attention that the commitments given to the committee on 16 December did not align with the response. In the second last and last paragraph of his letter of 25 April he states he does not believe the responses are not aligned and that rather his response reflects the fact he is the Accounting Officer for the Department of Health, and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department. He reiterates his response to confirm this was not a single decision point as to whether the analysis could or should be furnished to the committee but rather the collective corporate fiduciary responsibility of the Department of Health and the development board, cognisant of the confidential and commercially sensitive nature of the contents regarding a live strategically and financially important contract under project 2021. He also states that ultimate responsibility would lie with the Department. I am open to correction on this but my recollection of the previous occasion Mr. Watt came before the committee-----

The point I am making is that he says the decision relating to that refusal to give this committee the correspondence, either in a private session or on any other basis, is the collective corporate fiduciary responsibility of the Department of Health and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. My recollection - I am open to correction on this - is that when he was pressed on the matter he said that he took the decision when the last questioner raised it with him. That is my recollection of the matter, and this would appear to be at odds with it. He is saying that it is a corporate decision, but I thought I heard him say that day that, as Accounting Officer, it is his decision and that he made the decision.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	619	On that point, he also states that ultimate responsibility for this would lie with him. We are told that in February and March of this year, the value of claims increased by a further €31 million. That means a total of €585 million. From what I am aware of, any dispute that has been resolved has been resolved in favour of the contractor. It would be useful to get clarification on whether the contractor has lost any claims he has made. I am told that a number of them are on hold, for want of a better term. We have accepted, and it is broadly accepted now, that the cost of this project is going to exceed €2 billion, although that was not acceded to by the Department or the Secretary General. Considering that we are not being provided with this information it is a fair question to ask whether there is recourse for us to force a Department to provide us with documentation that we have sought and that we think is important to our deliberations. I do not know if that can be provided to us here or whether we need to go into private session for the clerk to tell us, but I do not believe we can accept a situation whereby, whether it is a corporate entity or an individual, the public service and a Department are essentially telling the Committee of Public Accounts of the Dáil that they are refusing to provide us with information relating to the expenditure of hundreds of millions of euro of public money and that they will not provide us with that information until, essentially, the money has been spent. That is unacceptable. On a further point, there have been reports of a number of arson attacks at the site in question. It would be useful if we could get clarification as to whether that will impact on the public outlay relating to the costs. For many contracts, if a contractor is undertaking works it is responsible for the security on that site while the works are ongoing. It would be helpful to get clarification that this is the case on this site or on whether insurance cover is in place to ensure there is no public outlay on that. On a separate matter but relating to the same Secretary General, we agreed last week to write to seek clarification in respect of the timeframe for which he had waived a portion of his salary. Could we get clarification that there was no late correspondence in that regard and that we have not received a response yet?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	620	With regard to the fires, when we did the site visit there this time last year I was informed that day that there had been an extraordinary number of fires on the site up to that date. We were there last June. That has continued. We will seek clarification on that and on the damages in terms of the financial cost of it. Is it in any way feeding into these claims? Is the cost of it being picked up by the contractor? Ultimately, the contractor would be responsible for both security and staff on the site. It is a very unusual situation, to put it mildly. There is €585 million in claims made by the contractor at this point. Only €22 million has been settled so far. It is only a tiny percentage that has been put to bed. The final price of this is hard to pin down at this point, but the least we are entitled to is to be given figures regarding the parameters they are working to. We will seek that.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	621	I have asked about the sanctions that might be applied, given that the contract is a two-sided process and that there is an obligation on the contractor's side. The contractor was slow to get the thing up and running, and we are now into an inflationary period. What I feel we are getting is an attitude of "Trust us" that all sanctions are being applied. This committee is required to satisfy itself regarding the matter rather than being told "Trust us". They are saying that some of the things are commercially sensitive. If something has been settled, it is gone and over. The decision has been made and it is no longer commercially sensitive. Some of the claims will fall into that category. None of us is trying to add to the cost of this building. It is expensive enough and it is going on for longer In fact, part of the reason that we were told the two-stage process could not be walked away from was that it would delay the delivery of the hospital, but if they had gone somewhere else it probably would have been no later than this is going to be delivered anyway. We are at the point where we are in a circle of correspondence that is completely ineffective. We have to get the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board before the committee so we can ask some of those questions to our satisfaction. It could be doing an amazing job in settling claims and rejecting things, but I want to see that for myself in the context of things that have already been done. I am not saying we should be interrogating things that are going to the courts or that have not yet been settled. I want to see the process and how robust it is. There have been times when there has been less than a full complement of people on the board. It was without a chair for a while. It is time that we satisfied ourselves.

We are due to have the board before the committee. I checked the work programme and it has been confirmed to me that we have corresponded with the board and that it will be before the committee on 16 June, which is approximately five weeks hence. We can try to question the board further then. In the interim, what is being proposed is that we write to the board to clarify if any damages have been paid by the contractor for failure to complete sections of the project by the agreed dates and also to request clarification from the board as to whether the conflict of interest was identified or considered and, if so, if it was addressed. What was Deputy Carthy's third point in his proposal?

This is setting a very dangerous precedent. If we are talking about a project to the tune of billions of euro where a Department is refusing to engage in a constructive way with the Committee of Public Accounts of the Dáil, which is how I would describe it, then that is something on which we need to explore all options.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-05-05 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	628	Under Standing Orders, we have the power to send for persons, papers and records.

We have sought this information on a number of occasions. What does that mean when a Department says “We are not giving it to you”? The Secretary General says that, generally, this was the collective corporate and fiduciary responsibility of the Department of Health and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and also that, as Accounting Officer, "ultimate responsibility for this would lie with me". I am not sure if it would stand up in a court case if someone was to say, “It was not me, judge, it was the collective corporate and fiduciary responsibility of me and all around me”. This is a blatant refusal to provide information that this committee has sought. They have cited confidentiality and the commercially sensitive nature of the contents but they have not, in my view, convinced this committee that those considerations would prevent this. As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, if providing us with this documentation were genuinely to cause a problem and increase the costs of the project, or even create that potential, then, of course, we are a prudent committee and we would accept that. However, all we have been told is that it would, and we have not been given any clear guidance as to how it would or why it would. Considering that this is a contract, if people enter into a contract, it should not really matter whether they tell somebody what is in it in order to allow one party to be able to exploit that.

I think we should pursue this and we should send for these records and documents. We need to just confirm first with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in that regard and then request to do that. We should move ahead with that as quickly as possible. Is that agreed? Agreed. No. 1212 B is from Ms Kerstin Mey, president, University of Limerick, UL, dated 26 April 2022, and provides an update requested by the committee in regard to the KPMG report regarding the purchase of a site in Limerick city. We have UL in next week so it is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Catherine Murphy wants to come in on that point.

It may be worth alerting them that they are required to have responses to those questions as to what it would take to reinstate funding if it has been suspended.

If we have to send for documents, I think we should. Let us see how it goes next week.

The whole idea of getting them in was that we were going to have that report in advance. If they are going to come along and pretty much tell us that we cannot talk about it, that it has gone to law and so on-----

This could be a very short meeting.

No. 1215 B, from Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive, National Transport Authority, NTA, dated 27 April 2022, provides further information requested by the committee in regard to DART projects and bus shelters. The transport strategy for the greater Dublin area 2022 to 2035 is being updated and is due to be finalised this year. I propose that we request that the NTA provide the committee with a copy of the strategy when it is finalised. Is that agreed? Agreed. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Catherine Murphy has flagged this for discussion.

The paragraph in regard to the updated greater Dublin area transport strategy 2022 to 2035 is due to be provided shortly. What it refers to is some extensions to the DART+ programme, both of which are in my constituency, one to Kilcock and the other on the Kildare line to Sallins. Those will be at minimal cost. In fact, for DART+, the railway order is to Kilcock and it is just 350 m away from the train station in Kilcock, yet it will not be stopping there. It goes there but people will not be able to get on, so there is a kind of daftness to some of this. There is not a large amount of cost involved in this. We might pursue that after we have been provided with that strategy.

That concludes our discussion of correspondence. Moving to our work programme, the following engagements are confirmed for May: the University of Limerick next Thursday, 12 May; the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May; and the Department of Health and the HSE on 26 May. Moving to June, to correct the record, the information I had last week was that 2 June was a non-sitting day but it is actually the following week, 9 June, as the bank holiday is a late one. We agreed to schedule engagements for June with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, and to examine local government oversight and accountability. The secretariat has contacted the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to confirm its availability for 2 June, and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to confirm its availability for 16 June. We also agreed to schedule an engagement to examine local government oversight and accountability in June. We will consider our approach to that in private session. Are there any other matters that members wish to raise in regard to the work programme? No. As usual, if there are any specific areas of interest that members wish to raise with the bodies on the work programme, or in any other areas, please let the clerk know so that briefing material can be requested in advance and the bodies are prepared to engage on the issues. That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today. The last item on the public agenda for today is any other business. Do members wish to raise any other matters? No. We will now briefly go into private session before adjourning until next Thursday, 12 May, when we will examine the University of Limerick’s 2019-20 financial statements.
