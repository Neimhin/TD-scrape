#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	In a report published this morning, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, showed that young people are at a particular disadvantage as a result of having multiple quality of life issues, including overcrowding, financial issues and so forth, while a survey by the Irish League of Credit Unions indicates that many families find it very difficult to afford the costs of children going back to school. When one compares that with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures relating to Irish economic growth which state that the Irish economy grew by a staggering 26% in 2015, one gets a real sense of the disconnect between the official figures and the reality for ordinary working people as depicted by the ESRI and the Irish League of Credit Unions. The CSO figures are not a bolt from the blue in the sense that we have known for some time that we do not have a proper, accurate statistical model for calculating the actual size of the Irish economy. This has very serious impacts, including on our budget planning, investment policies and our fiscal strategy. At a stroke it undermines fiscal rules and the fiscal treaty, because nobody believes the figures. Mr. Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate, has described it as leprechaun economics. Mr. Philip Lane of the Central Bank apparently went to the CSO last Monday to tell it that the figures are not real and do not accurately reflect the size of the Irish economy. There is economic growth, but clearly it is not in the order of 26%. As one economist said, I believe it was Mr. Tom Healy of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, even the Soviet Russia in the 1930s did not publish statistics of that scale. Others have also commented on the farcical nature of these figures. This damages Ireland's international reputation. As I said, this should not have been a surprise, although the scale of it has been. However, we have known for some time that our capacity to reflect our economic growth accurately has been impaired. Consider the budget figures of the past two to three years and the accompanying documentation. Hidden in the documentation was an acknowledgement by the Department of Finance that it could not explain tax buoyancy, particularly corporate tax buoyancy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	Certainly. I have 22 seconds left to ask it. I put it to the Taoiseach that at the core of this are the actions of such a model and any effort made in recent years to get to grips with this reality. Does he accept that the figure of 26% is farcical and damaging to the country internationally? Will he ask the CSO to design a new model to capture accurately what is happening in the economy, taking on board the globalised nature of the world economy and our interaction with it?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	3	First, the figures produced yesterday are unprecedented. They do not reflect accurately what is happening in the economy. Obviously, the figure of 26% is unprecedented and significantly stronger than the previous estimate of 7.8%, but it is important to note that is due to exceptional factors. It highlights the complexity and difficulty in interpreting the macroeconomic data in Ireland. The figures reflect a number of factors, including the impact of relocation of entire plcs to Ireland. This would have significantly boosted investment and net exports. Net exports contributed 18% to the 2015 growth figure. Contract manufacturing played a role in the figures. This occurs where an Irish-based company with another manufacturing unit abroad manufactures and sells products to other countries from that unit but is still based in Ireland. While the headline figures can be exaggerated in an Irish context and will obviously be the subject of intense scrutiny, other indicators such as the level of consumer spending, the rise in the level of employment and the continuous drop in unemployment trends, as well as taxation receipts, confirm that there is a strong recovery rooted in the domestic economy in Ireland. That domestic demand - spending by Irish businesses and Irish people - is also growing strongly. It is an opportunity arising from the many sacrifices made during the years. The figures predate the decision in Britain in the referendum. Obviously, there has been a sharp depreciation of sterling since that decision and a deterioration in the outlook for the UK economy. While it is an unprecedented figure, the fact is, based on growth projections in real terms, the growth levels seen in 2015 were both a one-off and exceptional in nature. We cannot make policy on that basis, but the CSO takes into account in compiling its figures issues such as aircraft leasing and manufacturing here by companies that have units abroad. As noted in the summer economic statement which was debated in the DÃ¡il some time ago, the Department of Finance will prepare a full macroeconomic projection in advance of the budget in October. It will include updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and whatever fiscal space is available to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, taking account of developments up to that time, including the latest CSO numbers and the decision in the United Kingdom.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	The Taoiseach did not answer the question, which was whether he would commission the CSO to design a proper, accurate way of calculating the real size of the economy. Professor John FitzGerald, formally of the ESRI, has attempted to do this as an individual. It is shocking that the Department of Finance and the Taoiseach's Department did not work years ago to create a proper model to calculate the size of the economy. The figures are not unprecedented. They are false in terms of what is happening on the ground and the reality in the economy. The CSO says it is including - not taking account of - the impact of aircraft leasing, corporate inversions and contract manufacturing, but none of this impacts on real jobs and investment in the economy, as the thousands of people who are struggling realise.It is not good enough that no one in official Ireland has attempted to address this by coming up with an accurate home-grown model that takes all of this into account, strips it out and gives us a proper figure.

No one in their right mind believes Irish official statistics. This cuts to the heart of our credibility in terms of presenting economic data. This is a serious issue which needs urgent addressing by the Taoiseach's Department, the CSO and other related State entities.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	10	It is true to say the CSO is quite independent in how it does its analysis, but it does take these factors into account. Changes have occurred, such as the transition of entire public limited companies to Ireland and the transfer of a significant amount of intellectual property, contract manufacturing and the scale of aircraft leasing. The Deputy is right in terms of these figures boosting GDP. There is no proportionate increase in employment. These are figures which are compiled accurately by the CSO and they take into account those changes that have taken place in the international economy. The Deputy is aware of the changes made by the Government in terms of complying with base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, and the OECD in terms of having got rid of the double Irish concept. The issues of aircraft leasing, contract manufacturing, intellectual property moving onshore here and the transition of entire public limited companies has boosted these figures.

I agree that an extraordinary elevation of 26% based on some of these factors and others, such as the depreciation of sterling, do not impact in reality on big numbers in terms of employment-----

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	15	With regard to the real value the economy, most schoolchildren have finished their studies for the summer and I hope they and their parents are enjoying the holiday break. For many parents this time of the year is one of worry and stress as they face the prospect of challenging costs associated with children returning to school in September. The report released by the Irish League of Credit Unions this morning highlights starkly this reality. The report finds it costs almost â¬1,000 a year to send a child to primary school and â¬1,500 for secondary school students. These are huge sums by any stretch of the imagination. This is bad enough, but picture the additional stress of many families with more than one child going back to school. The report also finds that more than 80% of parents feel the costs associated with sending their children to school are a significant financial burden. This is the value of the real economy and 80% is a lot of parents. Alarmingly, almost one third of parents find themselves in debt. They borrow an average of â¬357. This debt multiplies for those with more than one child going back to school. Some are turning to unscrupulous moneylenders and other short-term high-cost borrowing sources to put the money together to provide for their children.This is totally unacceptable, particularly when one takes into account the wider cost of living crisis, which is crippling families, and rising rents, mortgages, insurance costs, property tax and child care. This State is supposed to have free education in order to ensure that all citizens enjoy a decent opportunity in life. That is clearly not the case. Parents and children alike deserve better. More than one in ten parents are forced, we are told, to cut food bills in order to cover back-to-school costs. What has the Taoiseach done about this? He has made it worse. He has cut the back-to-school allowance by half since 2011. However, it is not too late. The Taoiseach could take some positive measures now and the State can afford them. He could increase funding to the school books grant scheme by 30%. He could increase funding to the school meals programme by 40%. He could increase the capitation grant to primary and post-primary schools. However, the biggest measure he could bring in is an increase in the annual back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance by â¬50. We costed this in our alternative budget for 2016. The total cost is â¬50 million for all these measures and â¬15 million in respect of the back-to-school allowance. That is clearly affordable. Why does the Taoiseach not send a clear message to the 80% of parents who need help with the cost of sending their children back to school? I ask the Taoiseach to agree to very modest propositions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	16	For a great number of parents the school year begins when the summer holidays begins because the implications of the costs of returning to school begin to exert pressure at that point. Child benefit has increased and access to free GP care for younger children is a saving to parents. We strongly support any measures that can be taken to reduce uniform costs for parents, including measures such as generic uniforms or those onto which the crest can be sewn. The Minister for Education is looking to introduce a stronger complaints procedure and a charter for parents. It is very necessary that during the course of the school year the school management and school authorities discuss with parents the projections for the following year. Where costs can be reduced, there is a saving all round. Regarding textbook costs, an agreement was reached with the Irish Educational Publishers Association a number of years ago by the former Minister, RuarÃ­ Quinn, which resulted in the agreement of a code of practice in this area. That code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintain editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years so that there is a clear follow-through. The publishers have also given clear assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock book rental schemes, which are an important way of reducing costs for students as well. Book rental schemes are clearly the most effective method of reducing the cost of school books for parents across the country. Since 2011, school book grants have been protected. There has also been an increase in the investment to ensure that all primary schools can offer book rental schemes. There was â¬6.7 million spent in 2014 to give seed capital to 400 schools in the primary sector that do not have book rental schemes so that they could establish them, and in 2015 and this year we have been increasing that investment to give additional support to other schools which already had book rental schemes established before that point to allow them to expand their schemes. There has been a â¬15.6 million investment specifically on expanding book rental schemes in primary schools over these three years, and that is on top of the â¬15 million that was spent on book grants for all schools which can be used for the maintenance and upkeep of the book rental stock. Returns for September 2015 indicate that 94% of primary schools and 65% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme. Finally, the Minister published last week the schools admission Bill, which prohibits the charging of fees or seeking of payment or contribution as part of the school admission process or for continued enrolment in the school, which is a further saving, recognising that this was an imposition on parents.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	17	I do not know. The Taoiseach took two and a half minutes to say "no" without mentioning the word "no". I proposed very modest measures which would cost the State â¬65 million in taxpayers' money. This money does not belong to the Taoiseach, Fine Gael or the Independents. I presume the Taoiseach will not act on my proposals. The back-to-school allowance does not cover the cost of getting children back to school. Although the Taoiseach said he had increased child benefit, this is after he cut it. He has reinstated some of it. This year, we celebrated the centenary of the 1916 Proclamation. It is done and dusted. The Proclamation was taken out, patriotic rhetoric was stated at commemorations, and now the Proclamation has been put away again for another 100 years. The Government gave free copies of the Proclamation to schools, schools which include children living in deprivation. UNICEF has shown that one third of Irish children suffer from material deprivation in households that cannot afford essential items. These reports tell us what we know if we run clinics in our constituencies and if we are connected with and embedded in our communities. The Taoiseach, in his non-answer, has chosen to ignore this crisis. We have offered constructive measures which would ease this. The â¬65 million would go a long way to relieving distress on families. Again, I ask the Taoiseach to just say "yes" and to increase the allowance, even by way of a supplementary payment to parents in the coming months.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	18	The Deputy is perfectly entitled to propose costed views for this or any other sector. I have pointed out some of the ways benefits have been increased for parents of young children through GP access, child benefit and the restriction on charging of fees under the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill. There are 18,700 applications for back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and there is a dedicated unit in the Department of Social Protection dealing with the area. The Deputy has put forward a point of view. The way the system has changed within the House with the new regulations means the Committee on Education and Skills will have an opportunity to give its opinions on the presentation of the budget for 2017. Everybody can support a reduction in costs for children, particularly regarding uniforms, generic uniforms and school schemes for rental and loans. The Deputy's point on the â¬50 million can be considered in the context of the preparation of the 2017 budget. Arising from Deputy MicheÃ¡l Martin's earlier question, people might have an inflated view of how much the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would have as a consequence of yesterday's CSO figures. His opportunity to raise expectations is not there. Growth will be limited to a very reasonable amount and the Minister is still restricted.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	Given that Ronnie Hanna was arrested in May 2016, can we expect NAMA to complain about him in May 2018? Aside from Frank Cushnahan, the arrest of Ronnie Hanna has brought Project Eagle back home to Dublin, yet the Government wants to bury its head in the sand.It is more than a year since I first gave the Garda the name of an individual who paid â¬15,000 in a bag in order to get favourable treatment from NAMA as well as the name of the NAMA employee who was taking the money. There was denial all around as usual. However, the man receiving the money has since been arrested on a different charge. Meanwhile, the guy who paid the bribe is doing well for himself; there is not a bother on him. Such is business in Ireland. The investment fund, Hibernia REIT, is taking a court action to have An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na removed from Harcourt Street station. These buildings were in NAMA and they are probably the most important buildings in the country for the Garda. The command and control centre for the whole of Ireland is based there. Moving and scattering this technical centre to the four winds will undermine the workings of the Garda. Will the Taoiseach explain why NAMA was allowed to sell this site to a vulture fund rather than keep it in State ownership? Hibernia REIT, which now owns the site, was set up by a guy who was a big player in NAMA where he was a portfolio manager for three years. When he joined the agency, he moved his 30% shareholding in his father's company to an offshore trust. Did he declare that to NAMA? The same company then benefitted from some lucrative work from the agency. He left NAMA in December 2012 and used his insider knowledge regarding the agency's assets to line up investment funds that would provide the finance for the new company, Hibernia REIT, which he manages. It would not require forensic examination to discover that Hibernia REIT did remarkably well in purchasing former NAMA assets, many of which this gentleman was involved with, but then that is how we do business in Ireland.  Does the Taoiseach not think that the public interest would be best served if we examined the complete workings of NAMA? At this stage the majority of people in Ireland believe NAMA is rotten to the core.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	22	It is not the first time Deputy Wallace has raised a matter in respect of NAMA, which is a matter of public interest. As I said before on quite a number of occasions, the advice given to me by the authorities is that this loan portfolio was sold following an open process to the highest bidder. On the questions of allegations against certain individuals in Northern Ireland, NAMA paid no moneys to any party on this loan sale against whom allegations of wrongdoing are now being made and, as I said before, if somebody has evidence, they should bring that to the authorities. I am also aware that two individuals that the Deputy mentioned were held for questioning in respect of the UK National Crime Agency, NCA, investigation into the Northern Ireland assets owned by NAMA and I am advised that the NCA has confirmed to NAMA that no aspect of the agency's activities are under investigation. I welcomed this previously, as did the Minister for Finance. These allegations are serious and, clearly, they have to be, and are being, investigated in that jurisdiction. Taking into account the investigations that are under way, the Minister for Finance has a view that no specific line of inquiry here can stand up and be usefully pursued by a commission of investigation. Many allegations have been made. The appropriate investigations are already taking place in the appropriate jurisdictions and it would be unwise to launch a very costly commission of investigation on claims that are currently under investigation by the authorities. The Deputy mentioned before the issue that he raised. These are specific allegations of wrongdoing. If there are ones that are not being investigated, obviously they should be brought to the attention of the Garda and the authorities. If this is an issue that is appropriate to a commission of investigation, we need more details on what the Deputy has there and in the absence of such specific allegations, it is right and proper that the appropriate authorities should have the time and space required to complete their investigations. The Deputy has raised the issue of the Garda station in Harcourt Street. I am aware of the situation there in so far as their being asked to move out is concerned. I think there is an objection lodged to that. Obviously, investigations, as I said, are going on in the Northern Ireland jurisdiction as well. The Comptroller and Auditor General is required, under section 226 of the NAMA Act, to produce a report every three years - that office is a completely independent body - assessing the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall objective. NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts on 9 July last year. At that appearance the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that his next section 226 report would look in detail at a sample of NAMA disposals and a sample of properties held by it for investment and, furthermore, that a specific review of Project Eagle, under section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, would be undertaken. That is under way. I do not know when it will be published but I understand quite a good deal of work has been done on it.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	24	The Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated that he intends to issue a report, under section 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, following this review of Project Eagle, and that is consistent with his powers to investigate, scrutinise and report independently on any aspect of NAMA's work which may arise through its annual audits or special reports about any aspect of NAMA's work. I assume if Deputy Wallace is raising a new issue on the basis of a new allegation, I am sure he will transmit that to the Garda or the authorities as well.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	26	That is probably the worst answer the Taoiseach has ever given me in the House in relation to NAMA. He did not answer any of the questions I asked him. I never mentioned the words "Project Eagle". I am tired talking about that in here. On that, the Taoiseach has made the point that there is no investigation into the workings of NAMA, even around that or anything else. It is blatantly obvious that the one jurisdiction where some investigation of a serious nature should be going on is the one that does not have one, and that is us. We do not want to know, or the Taoiseach does not want to know. I can understand why he does not want to know. As a matter of interest, how come no one can ever answer the question as to why NAMA never reported the fact this individual was in line for a â¬5 million backhander? Why, under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act, did it not report it? Why did the Minister for Finance not report it?

#NoelGrealishPD	unknown-#NoelGrealishPD-party	unknown-#NoelGrealishPD-dob	unknown-#NoelGrealishPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	39	In the past ten years just over 250,000 crimes have been committed by people while out on bail. The total is 250,149 to be exact. The people in question include murderers, rapists, robbers and burglars who have wreaked havoc and brought terror to our society. Between 2006 and 2015 people out on bail were responsible for 89 murders, 237 serious sexual offences, including rape, 50,000 thefts, the same number of public order offences and 18,000 burglaries. It gets worse. Figures from the CSO show that last year alone, almost 26,000 crimes were committed by people out on bail, a disturbing increase of 11% on the figure for the previous year. It is equivalent to 500 crimes per week being carried out by people who have already been charged with a criminal offence, in respect of which they are awaiting their day in court. They were apprehended by the Garda, charged and then released while a file was being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. A file could be with the Director of Public Prosecutions for months. In the meantime, the people in question are reoffending. It is very frustrating for gardaÃ­ and exceptionally upsetting for the victims of crime who see the criminal walking down the street and feel intimidated and fearful as a result. It is time the bail laws were radically reformed. It is time the people in question were immediately put behind bars. Is this being deliberately permitted because we do not have the space in prisons to put these vicious criminals away? I am not talking about people who carry out petty crimes but about murderers, rapists and vicious attackers. They should be held on remand while their files are being considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have received from the latest CSO figures for the first quarter of 2016. They paint an equally depressing picture, with a total of 6,049 crimes being committed where the suspected offender was out on bail for other offences. Meanwhile, these are the people who are enjoying free legal aid at taxpayers' expense, even in the most cut and dried cases. The people want to know when this ridiculous state of affairs will be brought to an end. They want to know when we can expect to have realistic laws which will threaten severe penalties for those who reoffend while out on bail. I am aware of the Bail Bill which is included in the legislative programme and in respect of which the justice committee finalised its pre-legislative scrutiny report on 11 November 2015. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to the people who are the victims of serious and vicious crimes that he will take these vicious criminals off the streets, hold them on remand and not allow them back onto the streets to terrorise and reoffend?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	40	I thank the Deputy for his comments and question. A moratorium on Garda recruitment was introduced in 2009. It has now been lifted and 1,200 gardaÃ­ have been recruited. The programme for Government commits to bringing Garda numbers to 15,000, which is important. The Government wants gardaÃ­ to be mobile and visible and have the facilities they need to do their job. More than â¬34 million has been invested in new vehicles, including motorbikes and patrol cars, a massive increase on the â¬4.8 million provided previously. I have spoken to senior Garda personnel, including the Commissioner, and the Minister for Justice and Equality on a number of occasions and they made the point that they were well aware of specific gangs carrying out specific burglaries and travelling to various parts of the country to do so. That is why Operation Thor was put into effect. It meant extra high-visibility patrols, the increased use of checkpoints, the use of high-powered vehicles for regional activities, programmes to reduce the level of offending by prolific offenders, a high-profile national prevention awareness scheme and enhanced support for victims. The Deputy will be aware from the many localities with which he deals that an additional almost â¬400,000 has been provided this year for the community alert and Crimestoppers programmes. They have developed as an important crime prevention mechanism, with more than 700 local groups and involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers. An estimated 200,000 text messages are sent each month to povide community information on possible criminal activity in different areas.Every Garda station, rural and urban, now offers a text alert service, and the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na published guidelines to assist the establishment of local groups. I want Deputy Grealish to understand that the Government believes that serious and serial offenders should be imprisoned. They should be imprisoned. That is why the TÃ¡naiste has asked the Attorney General to work on this legislation during the summer break to deal with a bail Bill. That will allow for refusal of bail in respect of repeat offenders, strengthen Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail and allow for the use of electronic tagging for those on bail where requested by gardaÃ­ or the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. The changes that have been made in terms of investment in Garda facilities and the changes that are coming in terms of the legislation, where repeat offenders can be refused bail, Garda powers are enhanced and, if necessary, electronic tagging will be introduced, are also an important deterrent in dealing with a system that has been out of hand in locations throughout the country. I am glad that Operation Thor is bringing that to heel, as it were.
#NoelGrealishPD	unknown-#NoelGrealishPD-party	unknown-#NoelGrealishPD-dob	unknown-#NoelGrealishPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	41	I am not questioning the Garda. What is happening with the bail laws is frustrating for the force. I do not doubt the Government's good intentions regarding reform of these laws. However, Government legislative programmes stretching back to when the Taoiseach took office in 2011 contained a commitment on introducing a bail Bill. Such a Bill has never been laid before the House and we are in 2016 without any having been enacted. I hope the current commitments prove more successful. There is a serious situation with criminals who have zero regard for the law. Something must be done quickly. According to a recent study, almost half of prisoners released from jail in Ireland go on to re-offend within three years, and the majority within one year. In the case of burglary, the rate is even greater at 70%. The guts of 100 crimes are being committed daily by people who are out on bail, obviously having calculated that the penalties for a second offence will be no greater than for the original. They are laughing in the face of our criminal justice system. Does the Taoiseach not agree that our bail laws have failed people? In the past ten years, people on bail have been responsible for 89 murders, 237 serious sexual offences, 50,000 thefts and more than 18,000 burglaries. Does the Taoiseach agree that the current bail laws have failed the victims of crime?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	42	Yes, I agree that the current bail laws need to be changed, and that is why the TÃ¡naiste has asked the Attorney General to work on the bail laws over the summer period. That will involve those three things: the refusal of bail, the enhanced powers for the Garda where breaches take place, and electronic tagging, if necessary. I would make the point as well that we should commend the members of the Garda, with the increased facilities they have, on the arrests they make, the burglaries they prevent and the gangs they take out of business. I note in the local newspapers that a gang reputed to have carried out in excess of 100 burglaries, or people associated with it, have been arrested, probably to be brought before the courts. I think that Operation Thor has been an undoubted success and will continue to be so, and that came about because of specific requests and information that gardaÃ­ had about particular gangs that were carrying out multiple burglaries. If one looks at the statistics in many locations in the country, because of the community alert scheme and the increased capacity of gardaÃ­ to be around and be mobile and visible, many of the different sectors of crime have fallen off, so to speak. There are still too many, and one is one too many. Bail laws that are changed will add to the opportunity for gardaÃ­ and the courts to do their duty in respect of burglaries. The Deputy is right to raise the point.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	53	With regard to the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill, the Taoiseach is aware of the case of Mary Boyle who went missing in 1977 while visiting her grandparentsâ home in County Donegal. It has been the subject of considerable public interest. Her family are, obviously, devastated by their loss. Obviously, no one in the House can interfere with an ongoing investigation and it was recently confirmed that the serious crime review team, known as the cold case unit, was investigating Mary Boyleâs disappearance. That is to be welcomed. Will the Taoiseach ensure, in the context of victimsâ rights, sufficient dedicated resources will be made available and that the investigation will be wholly independent of previous investigations and separate from what happened before? I have received correspondence from the Minister for Justice and Equality on a request made by Mary Boyle's sister, Ann Doherty, regarding when the coroner's inquest would take place. There is a legal precedent for accepting her request. Again in the context of victimsâ rights, will the Taoiseach re-examine the issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality? I have received a reply from the Minister on it, in addition to the replies to parliamentary questions I have tabled, in which she has confirmed that she is very much aware of all the issues involved and the allegations that have been made about the case but that the Garda, first and foremost, is investigating such allegations. I believe the forum in question would be the proper one in which to investigate this case.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	54	Like the Deputy, I have had some meetings with members of the family. I am glad that the special unit will examine the case completely independently. It will be seen to that the resources it needs to do its job independently will be made available because the family is still grieving over the loss of Mary Boyle. The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill is priority legislation and a great deal of work has been done on it. I do not know whether it will be published before the end of this session, but it is moving towards completion. A coroners Bill is being worked on in the Department of Justice and Equality. I will update the Deputy on the extent of the work done in this regard.

The programme for Government states the Government will utilise the rural development programme to support the promotion of farm safety. The Health and Safety Authority's report for 2015 has revealed that 56 people were killed in workplace accidents, 18 of whom were working in the agriculture sector, the sector with the highest number of deaths. The report also reveals that there were over 7,500 non-fatal injuries, which represents a huge increase on the figure for the previous year. At the same time, there has been a decrease in the number of inspections and investigations, by more than 40%, since 2009. The chairman has blamed this on resource issues. Is this acceptable? What steps will the Government take to honour its commitment in the programme for Government to promote farm safety? Will it increase funding and make more resources available to ensure health and safety at work?

There is a constant stream of warnings and calls to people to be exceptionally careful when working with farm machinery in any location. More inspections and contact with farmers by the authorities is part and parcel of this. Unfortunately, lives are lost every year in accidents involving machinery, PTOs, and tractors that one might think would never happen.

The previous Government phased out mortgage interest supplement for new applicants as of the beginning of 2014. Everybody who receives the supplement will be removed from the scheme as of 1 January 2018, while those in receipt of mortgage interest relief will no longer receive it as of 1 January 2017. The Government has made a commitment to replace these schemes with what it describes as sustainable solutions. When will we see the sustainable solutions the Government has promised aimed at keeping in their homes people who previously received some assistance through these schemes? I am dealing with people who are in trouble. They took the Minister's advice and contacted their lenders and some have done deals, but they continue to find themselves in extreme financial difficulty because mortgage interest supplement or relief is not available to them. When will the promised sustainable solutions to replace these schemes be introduced and what action will be taken in the interim for those who find themselves in difficulties and are no longer able to avail of the schemes?

The Minister for Justice and Equality is considering a new and enhanced service from the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, which would deal specifically with these issues. This will be brought forward as soon as possible. It is in everybody's interest that as many people as possible are allowed to stay in their homes. These timelines mean that an alternative service has to be produced in order that people can avail of these facilities to stay in their homes. I will update Deputy Boyd Barrett on the work that is under way. A new enhanced MABS is being considered and worked on to deal with many of these kinds of cases.

I have become aware that last Monday an official from Transport Infrastructure Ireland or, as it was previously known, the NRA, informed Cork County Council that this project was not going to go ahead until 2022. Who is in charge of the provision of infrastructure? Is it the NRA, the Government or the Minister? It looks to me like there is no accountability in DÃ¡il Ãireann.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	83	I know that when one crosses the county bounds heading for Cork, one runs into that particular problem every day. The National Roads Authority has responsibility in terms of the preparation, presentation and design of major road infrastructure throughout the country. The Government's role is to be able to provide the facilities and money to deal with infrastructure development, whether roads, bridges or whatever. There is a â¬42 billion capital programme out to the mid 2020s. If someone from the NRA says that the project is not due to go ahead until 2022 or whatever date Deputy Healy-Rae said, then there is a reason for that, whether it be objections or compulsory purchase orders or whatever. Those in the authority are professional in the way they do their business in respect of all the roads in the country. I recall when the capital programme was being put together that this road was deemed to be a priority. However, it is not for the Government to say that a route has to take this line or that line or a particular design based on the geological formation for the development of a road. As Deputy Healy-Rae is aware, from Ballyvourney outwards there are some difficulties with the terrain.

The data released yesterday along with the census data to be released tomorrow mean that the Summer Economic Statement as printed is not only inadequate because it was predicated on a "Remain" vote winning in the UK, but we now have the extraordinary new data and size measurements for the Irish economy. It makes it impossible to do the new politics in which we are meant to get information on a timely basis from which we can make economic decisions. I am not asking for it to be done next week, but if we could have it sometime around 10 September, the July and August figures would be incorporated and it might then be a serious measurement? It would also give the CSO time to look at the real size of the Irish economy.

These will be dealt with by the sectoral committees in early September. As the discussion about Brexit develops, the situation pertaining to sterling and the outcome of yesterday's CSO figures will lead to that discussion taking place. I will bear it in mind and make arrangements with the Ministers for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform that it be dealt with either through the sectoral committees or here in the House when the opportunity presents itself.

State policy or at least State philosophy in this country is that elderly and infirm people should be catered for in so far as possible in the comfort and security of their homes. However, as in many other cases, philosophy and practice diverge. If somebody reaches the position that they are too old and infirm to look after themselves or for their family to look after them without support, two routes are open to them. The first option is the fair deal scheme where somebody goes into a nursing home, pays the appropriate contribution and is supported by the State. The second option is home-care services. As the fair deal scheme is on a statutory basis, people have an absolute right to it if they fulfil the relevant criteria. Home-care services, on the contrary, are given on a discretionary basis. Therefore, State policy has directed more people to the fair deal scheme than should otherwise be the case. Another issue with the home-care scheme is that it is geographically based. Therefore it depends on whether the various ingredients that make up an appropriate home-care package in any case are available in the locality where the patient resides. Local health officials may determine that if the necessary ingredients are not available in a locality, the patient will have no option but to opt for the fair deal scheme. Ironically it costs the State approximately three times as much to provide a fair deal package as it does to provide a home-care package. If the home-care package were put on a statutory basis whereby people who meet certain criteria have an absolute right to it, more people would opt for the home-care package with a considerable saving to the Exchequer. Existing home-care services are sporadic and inconsistent. They are not patient driven and there are significant geographical disparities in the availability of services. Often it depends on where the person happens to live. There is no transparency in eligibility criteria and decision-making; it is entirely at the discretion of the health service. In view of this, many elderly infirm people have little choice but to opt for nursing-home care at far greater cost to the Exchequer. The ultimate solution to this is to amend the legislation providing for the fair deal to have a similar set of criteria for home-care packages. The health criteria should be the same but the financial criteria would be different to reflect the different cost structures of looking after somebody in a nursing home as opposed to at home. I am currently drafting legislation to encompass this but in the meantime this Bill would provide a temporary solution whereby if somebody is assessed for the fair deal, he or she would have a right to request that a home-care package be put together. The health service would be compelled to put that home-care package together and the patient would be entitled to receive it as opposed to the fair deal scheme if it is less costly for the Exchequer and also if it can be safely done.I emphasise that when I say "less costly for the Exchequer", I am talking about the difference between the net cost to the Exchequer of home care packages under the fair deal scheme after the person's contribution has been deleted and the full cost of a home care package. I am not suggesting that as part of this Bill we should propose to impose a charge for home care packages. I think this legislation is a reasonable first step towards putting home care services on a statutory basis for the benefit of the population at large and, not least, for the benefit of the taxpayers of this country. I commend the Bill to the House.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	96	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together. I had a short telephone call with Prime Minister Cameron on Friday, 24 June last. I indicated my regret at the outcome of the UK referendum and my respect for the democratic decision of the UK electorate. I expressed my appreciation for the close working relationship we shared over a period of unprecedented warmth in relations between our two countries. He echoed these sentiments and agreed that the bilateral relationship will remain a joint priority for both Governments, with a special focus on Northern Ireland. Obviously, Mr. Cameron is leaving office today. In this regard, on Monday, 27 June last, I spoke to First Minister Foster and Deputy First Minister McGuinness to underline that issues likely to affect Northern Ireland and the North-South relationship will be top priorities for the Government in future negotiations. I also spoke to First Minister Sturgeon of Scotland. While I did not have any formal bilateral meetings with other European leaders at the European Council on 28 June or at the informal meeting of 27 member states the following day, I spoke specifically to Prime Minister Cameron about the common travel area, the peace process and the open Border situation. I had short exchanges with a number of other leaders, including Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Tusk and President Juncker. The issues we discussed were mostly those addressed in the 29 June statement, about which I addressed the House on 5 July in my report on the European Council meeting. I took every opportunity at the European Council and in the other discussions, to underline our unique relationship with the UK and our concerns regarding Northern Ireland, North-South relations, the common travel area and trade between the UK and Ireland. At the European Council and since then, Prime Minister Cameron has spoken along exactly the same lines. We have been emphasising these points to our EU partners for some time. They are widely understood and appreciated. I reiterated these concerns when I travelled to Berlin yesterday to meet Chancellor Merkel. She fully acknowledges and is understanding of our perspective. She has assured me that we share the objective of constructive negotiations towards a close future relationship between the EU and the UK. I also took the opportunity to highlight Ireland's strong commitment to EU membership, as I have in my discussions with all our counterparts. We agreed that we must use the period of reflection before Article 50 of the EU treaties is triggered to address how the difficulties facing the EU can be overcome and the confidence of citizens can be increased. President Hollande is planning to visit Ireland on 21 July next for a Somme commemorative event and a bilateral meeting. I am sure the EU-UK question will be the major issue for discussion at our meeting. With regard to events in the UK over recent days, I hope to have an early opportunity to speak to David Cameron's successor as Prime Minister, Theresa May, once the formalities of her appointment are confirmed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	97	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. With a new Prime Minister taking office today, we should be moving forward with a greater degree of certainty in the relationship with Britain and on the Brexit question. There has been much uncertainty in the past three weeks, but matters have moved much faster than originally anticipated. Some of the coverage of yesterday's meeting in Berlin with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is reading too much into what she said. Nobody could reasonably object to the idea that we need to know what the United Kingdom is seeking before we can agree a way to respond to it. There appears to be an idea developing in certain sections of the Tory Party that the timing for triggering Article 50 is to be used as a negotiating weapon. That is of no help to anybody. We cannot all be held to ransom, particularly by those who demanded Brexit, while they try to figure out what they meant and what they want. The uncertainty can cause economic harm and damage the global economic situation, particularly in Europe. Article 50 should be triggered sooner rather than later. We all had accepted the September timeline as being reasonable to give the London Government time to arrive at its basic position and then trigger Article 50. What is the Taoiseach's view? Has he made this point to the UK Government and will he make it when he meets and speaks to the new Prime Minister? Mr. David Cameron leaves office having, unfortunately, presided over the debacle of the Brexit referendum which was poorly planned. It was poor judgment to call a referendum in the first instance. I realise the Taoiseach had a reasonably good personal relationship with Mr. Cameron, although I am not sure how that was reflected in substantial policy outcomes. Mr. Cameron neglected Northern Ireland to an excessive degree and probably indulged anti-European Union rhetoric too much. In the last while he probably took this on board to an excessive degree and I believe it had an impact on the subsequent result. The referendum result has and will continue to have an enormous impact. It was an enormous risk to take without any plan B or thought being given to what would happen if the Brexit vote was won. It is now too late to stop it. It is going to happen, but we must ensure British policy changes. The Taoiseach has indicated that he envisages speaking to the new Prime Minister shortly. Will he indicate when he expects a meeting to take place? Will he seek an early summit on Northern Ireland? Obviously, it would include a discussion on the Brexit negotiations, but it would also cover the need to restore political faith in the political process and ensure greater momentum. The Taoiseach indicated previously to the House that officials of the State were to meet British officials for preparatory discussions on the common travel area and to prepare the ground for the Brexit talks. Have the officials met? Is there an acceptance on the British side of the need to deal with the Border issue? Are there signs of flexibility in how they envisage this unfolding? What new full-time resources have been assigned in the Taoiseach's Department to work on Brexit and have staff been delegated from other Departments to work on it?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	98	Given the worrying rise of political forces in Britain who have traded on anti-immigrant sentiment which is dangerous and, frankly, racist, will the Taoiseach join me in wishing Mr. Jeremy Corbyn the best of luck in the Labour Party leadership battle? A victory for him is the best hope some politics might emerge in Britain that will move in a more progressive direction, particularly in view of his unconditional support for the rights of migrants and immigrants in Britain. He is thoroughly anti-racist and in the aftermath of the Chilcot report, anti-war, unlike the discredited Blairite rump that is now trying to stab him in the back. Perhaps the Taoiseach might respond to that brief question. My main question relates to the European Union and the debate and controversy into which it has been thrown, particularly in the light of Brexit. When there have been questions raised and criticisms made of the European Union, it has presented itself as the benign and progressive force in European politics. Does the Taoiseach think there is a supreme irony and hypocrisy in the fact that it is the European Union which claims it supports the free movement of people which might be the obstacle in the way of the free movement of people between Britain and Ireland? It demonstrates that the European Union's commitment to the free movement of people and internationalism stops at the borders of Europe, at frontier Europe, even in so far as it may affect us and our relationship with our nearest neighbour, Britain. Does the Taoiseach agree that he must be steadfast in pointing out to the European Union that if it claims to be committed to the free movement of people, that free movement should extend beyond the borders of fortress Europe, be it between Britain and Ireland or to poor Syrian refugees who are trying to get into the European Union? Did the Taoiseach raise at the European Council the recommendations made by the Committee on Housing and Homelessness? The committee urged the Government to urgently seek flexibility from the European Commission in the application of EU fiscal rules to the financing of social housing. That is what the all-party committee established by the DÃ¡il to deal with the social housing emergency asked the Government to raise with the European Union. Will the Union give us flexibility under these crazy fiscal rules that are preventing us from spending even our own money to provide the social housing we urgently need? Did the Taoiseach raise that issue? Will he insist on us being given such flexibility or will he only insist on what I heard the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, say, that Ireland might leave the European Union if it dares to do anything about corporation tax? That appears to be a red line issue for the Government. Is it a red line issue for the Taoiseach to go to the European Council to demand flexibility under EU fiscal rules to deal with the biggest crisis facing the country in order that we can make the investment required in the provision of urgently needed council housing?

The Foreign Ministers of the six nations that founded the European Union met separately on at least three occasions before the Brexit referendum and again afterwards. Representatives of this state were not invited to attend those meetings. That is very strange.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	112	I really would not have expected Chancellor Merkel to say anything different from what she said yesterday, but as a number of people acknowledged, things have moved on since then. Theresa May, MP, becomes British Prime Minister today. That change in Downing Street has moved more quickly than expected. She has said she will not consider triggering Article 50 until next year. This is vitally important, in that as Prime Minister she is equal co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. That is an international Agreement. We have been advocating for some time for the Taoiseach to enlist international support for it. Mrs. May has said that she wants to scrap the Human Rights Act, which is a fundamental cornerstone of the Agreement. She has also indicated that she wants to do away with other human rights aspects of it. Did the Taoiseach raise this with Chancellor Merkel? If he did, did he make it clear that the Irish Government will not countenance or tolerate any action by the British Government if it undermines the integrity of these international Agreements? On Brexit, I met members of the East Border Region Group last week, which covers six council areas each side of the Border. All those involved, who secured almost â¬50 million in the last 16 years, are very concerned about up to 19 projects that are now threatened. When I raised this with the Taoiseach last week, he said it was a stalled process.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	116	At the informal meeting of 27 EU Heads of State and Government on 28 June there was a preliminary discussion about next steps, further to the outcome of the recent referendum. I should emphasise that a large degree of uncertainty persists on the UK side in regard to a number of key issues. These in turn will have a significant bearing on the process in the months ahead. To a great extent therefore, it is not possible to speculate on negotiation outcomes at this point. Partner countries accept that UK politics has been going through a turbulent phase and we will have to wait until new Prime Minister May outlines her Government's approach and her strategy regarding its future relationship with the EU. Of particular note will be clarity around the timing of the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, as well as the separate question of what type of relationship the UK will seek with the EU. Access to the European Economic Area is one of a number of options that might be considered by the UK in terms of its future relationship with the EU, but this will be a decision for the British Prime Minister to take in due course. In the meantime, a number of important matters have been clarified. The 27 EU leaders agreed that there can be no negotiations until Article 50 is triggered, and that, while this will not happen immediately, it should take place as soon as possible. In addition, it was agreed that the European Council, that is, the Heads of State and Government, will direct the process. The European Commission and the European Parliament will also play important roles. Indications are that the negotiations could take at least two years. In the interim, the UK remains a full member of the EU. Regarding Irelandâs strategic approach to negotiations, our overall interest lies in a stable, prosperous and outward-looking UK. The closer its future relationship is with the EU, the better from our perspective. We will need to make sure in due course that the negotiating mandate, which has to be given by the Member States, including Ireland, reflects our particular concerns. We have been emphasising our unique perspective, especially in regard to Northern Ireland, North-South relations, the common travel area and trade, to our EU partners for some time and I am confident that this is now widely understood by them.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	117	Will the Taoiseach consider establishing a forum on Anglo-Irish relations outside the North-South Ministerial Council and outside any veto that any party might have within it? It is the sort of forum we need, like the Forum for Europe, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation or the New Ireland Forum. It is vital we have some sort of place where we can think about this in a certain way. Will the Taoiseach proceed with that idea outside the North-South Ministerial Council or any of the confines of the Good Friday Agreement? Will the Taoiseach also make certain in the negotiations that there is recognition of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the possibility of the reunification of Ireland in any future agreement between the EU and the UK? In other words, we cannot have an agreement that might preclude the possibility of a reunification of Ireland. That would obviously have real consequences for whatever deal would have to go through. Will the Taoiseach consider establishing an advisory council similar to what First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, MSA, established in Scotland, which is bringing in international, academic and other national experts outside the public service system, and which would advise our Government in the approach it needs to take? First Minister Sturgeon set that up within days of the Brexit vote. Such is the scale and the implications of this issue, it is vital for us to set up a similar advisory council. We have a meeting tomorrow and we might be able to consider the details of it, but I would be interested to know the Taoiseach's views in the House as to whether such an advisory council might be set up.

It is important to say that I want to restructure the Department of the Taoiseach in the sense of forming a new Cabinet committee, which will be chaired by me with principal Ministers to attend and those, if necessary, beyond that; to strengthen the numbers in the different missions we have abroad in Rome, London, Berlin, Paris and so on; and to take in extra staff to the relevant Departments, either by contract or by moving from one Department to the other. We will transfer some staff from the Department of the Taoiseach back to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in order to have a more specific focus in the Department of the Taoiseach, assisted by a second Secretary General and staff to focus on Brexit and related issues. The Deputy mentioned an Anglo-Irish forum. This is worth considering, but we have a lot of contact at the moment. Senior officials are meeting. Deputy Martin raised this question already. I will look for an early meeting with new Prime Minister May. In respect of a Northern Ireland summit, these are important issues. It is becoming very clear to Northern Ireland representatives what the implications of Brexit might mean, depending on the eventual outcome. On the question of the implications in terms of the reunification of Ireland, we are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement. That contains the elements for consideration of whether that might be given consideration, triggered by a future Secretary of State if it was felt there was a majority in favour in that regard. The meetings that have now taken place with some Ministers here on a cross-Border basis are beginning to be understood by many of the MLAs. The costs could be quite considerable, as will the deficit in infrastructure and planning for future years. If, for instance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform needs to provide moneys for project X or Y, if there will be a decline or withdrawal of European moneys we cannot front-load it from here with no compensation coming from the other side. These are all things that will have to be teased out. Clearly we will have to wait and see first what the British want. Do they want a Norwegian, Swiss, Canadian or Singaporean strategy?What is the intent of the new Prime Minister? I hope to be able to get an early meeting with her to discuss some of this. It is important that we should have the capacity to draw on some of the experience that exists here on Europe and the United Kingdom. I would not want to set up a statutory council, but there are people around who have had great experience in Europe over the years and have dealt with Britain and Europe. They have a lot of experience on which we can draw. There were some discussions about a consultation process on an all-island basis, and while particular parties can have different points of view I have worked very well with First Minister Foster. I was in Enniskillen in each of the past five years for Remembrance Sunday. It is necessary that I, on behalf of the Government, understand the feelings and challenges of Northern Ireland business and how people are looking at the outcome of the vote and the consequence of Brexit for them. While we do not have a negotiating mandate down here, it is important for them to understand that we have an interest, obviously, because of the Good Friday Agreement and North-South association. These matters will have to be teased out in great detail. If we have a situation where we have a country remaining in the EU, which is Ireland, and the United Kingdom leaves, we will have some capacity to monitor goods travelling through from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland, that is from an EU country to a country that is not in the EU. I do not want to see any hard border or the checkpoints that were there for many years. We do not want to see that. There is a range of issues, and I will brief Members on them tomorrow, in respect of the changes we will make to the structure in the Department of the Taoiseach to deal with Brexit and its consequences and beefing up those things. In that sense, I know First Minister Sturgeon put together a capacity for international advice. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already brought back all of the ambassadors and we have a lot of contact and a lot of connection there. We do not need too many entities, but it is important that the wide range and spectrum of advice and information is available to us and it will be. All of this is moving and the next step is for the Prime Minister to say-----

A real driving focus from a specific committee here with capacity to call in Ministers and deal with all of those different agencies and get the information will all come to heel whenever Prime Minister May triggers article 50. I tend to agree with Deputy Martin that it should not be delayed too long. The Prime Minister was not to be elected until October, then it was September and now it is today, so there would be a view across Europe that if this were to be delayed too long into the new year it would cause a lot of confusion, uncertainty and angst, particularly in financial sectors. It is the right of the country which wishes to leave to trigger article 50 and we will have to wait and see what she actually says.

Things have moved at a quicker pace than we expected even last week, regarding the formation of the new British Government and potentially the triggering of article 50 of the treaty. The point we were discussing here on how to formulate an agreed basis for an approach from Ireland that would impact well for the people North and South is something that now has new urgency. I will not make any comment about how this has been handled to date, other than to say I do not think it should derail the need to do it still. I do not think anybody has a veto on that. I have had discussions with some colleagues. I was at a Party of European Socialists leaders' conference last week, and Deputy Boyd Barrett will be delighted that I had discussions with Jeremy Corbyn there. I and Colum Eastwood made a joint presentation to all colleagues on the unique impact of the British vote on Northern Ireland. Perhaps tomorrow is the time to discuss this, but we need to put on the table the proposal of many people here for some type of forum to know what is the optimum end game for the people of this island so that we can condition the ground rules that will be set by the Council for the negotiations once the article is triggered. Deputy Ryan made a very valid point on broadening the scope of people. I do not want to sound in any way critical, but many of the very fine civil servants we have engaged in these matters, who are some of the finest public servants in Europe, come from a mindset that is very eurocentric. We need to broaden this debate now because we are in very changed times. The point made by Deputy Adams, which the Taoiseach answered last week by stating structural fund issues were in abeyance or on hold - I cannot remember the exact phrase used - is that people are depending on these funds to plan not only the infrastructure matters the Taoiseach has discussed but also community initiatives and PEACE IV, and we need to have very much sooner than later a clear timeline on how these matters will be funded and resolved.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	126	I want to caution against any additional structure between this State and Britain. Of course the State has a duty and responsibility to engage with the British Government on matters relating to this State, but the virtue of the arrangements we have with the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council is that we have an all-island North-South joined up position despite the difficulties and differences of opinion.

I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks today about getting the opinions of the business sector in the North. I can tell him it is not just clear-cut; many people now understand this will not be good for the economy or for harmony in the North or for the people in Border counties. We will have the chance to talk tomorrow and once again argue for the need to have all-island inclusive involvement of as many people as are prepared to be part of it. The three leaders here have all agreed on this idea and the Taoiseach has said it is a good idea, so one leader saying "No" should not stop us.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	129	It is not the first time a Unionist party has disagreed with a party down here. Back in the 1980s, the late Garret FitzGerald invited the parties to talk at the New Ireland Forum. The Unionist party did not participate formally, but the two McGimpsey brothers did. Irrespective of the difference of opinion about it, it is important in an all-island sense that we have a fix on this because people involved in Northern business are making contact stating they would like to put forward their views on what they think are the challenges. It will be very important when discussions take place about the future relationship. Ireland is at the elbow of the journey to the UK and Europe and, clearly, our association with Northern Ireland is critical to this. When the projects and proposals are being looked at, we will have a resource problem unless we can get agreement on how these things can be dealt with.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	130	The Cabinet committee on infrastructure, environment and climate change had its first meeting on Thursday, 7 July. It is an important committee which will focus on the implementation of the infrastructure commitments of A Programme for Partnership Government and the capital investment plan. It will also address the climate change challenge in terms of domestic policy and measures as well as in relation to our EU and international obligations.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	131	Was the Cabinet's decision to adopt a commercial stimulus model as its ownership model for broadband and to leave our communications infrastructure in the hands of the private sector discussed by the Cabinet committee on infrastructure, environment and climate change? If it was, it reinforces what I think is a serious mistake because rural Ireland, as the Taoiseach knows, has been denied essential services which many urban areas take for granted.That is especially the case for broadband. The former Minister for Communications, Alex White, told me in a response to a parliamentary question last December that there are still 15,000 households and premises in my constituency of Louth to be covered. He said that he hoped - this was six months ago - that 85% of the addresses in this State would have access to high-speed services by 2018, with all addresses covered by 2020. Now the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has said this will not happen until 2022, so I do not know how we can believe the Government on matters of timeframes. In the meantime, rural Ireland suffers. Ba mhaith liom ceist amhÃ¡in eile a ardÃº go gasta, the issue of climate change and climate justice. I am conscious that, in the case of those families, businesses and rural communities which suffered so badly from the flooding, roads and buildings are still not fixed and a total of 300 locations across the State are being assessed. These locations have been designated in the draft flood mapping, which has not been finalised. I ask the Taoiseach when the draft plan to provide flood defences will be published. May we get a report on the draft Shannon catchment flood risk assessment and management plan? Can the Taoiseach give us some sense of the work of the Shannon flood State agency co-ordination working group to tackle flooding along the Shannon?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	132	The Deputy has raised a number of questions. The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, had meetings with the different groups about the response to flooding and what should be done, both in regard to the more long-term situations arising from the Shannon and other locations where serious money has been invested, and in regard to smaller areas where there has been flash flooding, such as in areas around south Galway where individual houses were flooded. I am sure he would be happy to give Deputy Adams a detailed account of the progress made in that regard. The Government decided on 5 July on the ownership model for broadband. The next stage of the procurement process is the commencement of the detailed technical and financial negotiations with qualified bidders. This competitive dialogue phase is scheduled to commence in July and is anticipated to take at least ten to 12 weeks. I dealt with Deputy Howlin on this matter last week. This is not a situation like that of Eircom, where there was a nationally owned public system, but rather an extension of private facilities. Two models were considered. First, the commercial stimulus or, as I said, gap funding, where the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network, with contractual obligations to the Department in respect of users and people. Second, the full concession, which means the private sector finances, designs, builds and operates the network, with contractual obligations to the Department and the asset being handed back to the State after 25 years. Therefore, while the Government recognises the long-term value of the State's owning any networks built, the advice received was that under a full concession model, the entire cost of the project, which is very significant, would be placed on the Government's balance sheet, with serious implications as a consequence for the available capital funding over the next five to six years.

However, given that both models would deliver the same service and be governed by almost an identical contract, the concession model would have reduced the amount of money available to Government for other critical priorities, such as climate change, housing or health, over the next five to six years. Those technical negotiations are now ongoing and I hope that when the contract is awarded, it can then be rolled out by the task forces in the different local authority areas and bring the broadband situation to a head. Did the Deputy ask me about another matter?

The Cabinet committee that is the subject matter of this discussion is reviewing this because we need urgent and ambitious plans to address our infrastructure. There was an announcement during the week that, for example, the Macroom bypass, the N28 and other road projects will now not be completed until 2022. I know there has been a tendency in recent times that pre-election promises tend to be two-election promises; in other words, they are never meant to be implemented in the immediate aftermath of the election but will come on stream after the following election. Is it envisaged that a revised capital investment plan be produced this year? There is a need for strategically important investment to include broadband, road infrastructure and other issues. In terms of the climate change aspect of this committee, not enough has been made of the dramatic news in recent weeks about the hole in the ozone layer narrowing and closing. The great story there is that it illustrates corrective action works. One of the great difficulties for climate change has been a lack of acceptance of the phenomenon by key policy-makers and political leaders for too long and a sense that there is nothing we can do, that it is inevitable and so on. The example of what is happening to the ozone layer and the corrective action, legislatively and that parliaments and governments around the world have taken, has apparently had a very significant impact, according to scientists. There is a need for the Government to drive that message home in a national programme in terms of climate change so that we get the whole of society to embrace the idea of action to mitigate the impact of climate change. This is already happening, as the Taoiseach is aware, globally, in Africa. We talk about migration in the context of the Syrian conflict but there will also be very significant migration out of Africa because of climate change. There therefore needs to be an understanding of this among our society. It was a missed opportunity by many governments - not just our own - and states and societies not to use that example of what is happening to the ozone layer as a catalyst for greater urgency and momentum behind climate change action.

It has been timed very well for us to start showing leadership on climate change. If we can lead with that planning framework, thinking long-term, and if we think to, say, 2030, 2040 or 2050, we know one thing for certain. We know very little about what will happen in 2050 but we know we have to completely decarbonise our entire energy system, transport system and heat system. The planning framework gives real opportunity to be the centre of our leadership. The timing is also good in that the planning framework could lead on or influence the review of the capital plan which, I understand, will be available early next year. The Chief Whip was at a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, a number of weeks ago at which we talked about this issue. One thing we agreed on, I think, at that meeting was that, more than anything else, we need to ask our people for help rather than all the time having a top-down approach, choosing which town or city will progress, which town will get the money and which one will not. We need to start asking our people and our communities, as part of this planning process, what are their ideas as to how they can develop their home as a sustainable, prosperous place. It seems to me that the forces are aligning in a certain way that allows us to set and show leadership on climate, which I believe we have to do and which will benefit our country in every way. I know this will come up later but there is an opportunity to include the issue of climate change in the citizens' convention so that at that top, central level we also consider how we lead on this. There is a sense of something positive but the forces are aligned for this committee to use those structural elements within Government to really change our approach to the climate issue.

There has been a significant change in ECB monetary policy from the period of Mr. Trichet to that of Mr. Draghi. Money is now available virtually at zero interest to states, which is all well and good if states could spend it.On the fiscal side the structural rules are still very rigid. For example, the â¬400 million raised from the sale of Bord GÃ¡is Energy, BGE, assets that was and still is available to the State to invest immediately in social housing cannot be deployed because it would break the fiscal rules on expenditure. Last week I talked to a number of colleagues across Europe and there was a great deal of support for considering amending the fiscal rules. The European Union needs to show that it is capable of dealing with crises. We cannot always learn in looking backwards. We must also learn in looking forwards at people's needs. We must show, in a prudent manner - God knows, I would not be arguing for profligacy - that we can use resources and the cheap money being made available by the European Central Bank to address real infrastructural deficiencies, including broadband provision, completion of the road network, schools, hospitals and health care systems. Will the Taoiseach take up the issue with colleagues to see if he can build, as we tried to do in the past, a consensus among member states to exempt infrastructural investment, to some degree, from the fiscal rules?

She had just returned from Ethiopia, where, she told me, a population of 80 million would increase to 200 million by 2050, 50% of whom would be under 17 years of age. They are extraordinary demographics. Climate change is challenging on the African continent. I take Deputy Eamon Ryan's point about asking people to help. The Chief Whip has informed me that she wanted an amendment in respect of the citizens' assembly to deal with the issue of climate action. I am happy about this and I am sure the citizens' assembly will be very happy to consider it. I suppose Deputy Brendan Howlin was talking about EUROSTAT.

A couple of months ago I wrote to President Juncker about the matter and he sent back a very good reply, offering an opening. I spoke to the European Council about it and other countries have followed suit. I met one of the chief directors of EUROSTAT, which categorises these matters in a particular way, and I have put officials here in touch with her. I expect that we will make some headway. Social housing has been ruled out for PPPs in a number of countries by EUROSTAT categorisation. I am not seeking a change in the rules but a method of accommodating the fact that people should be able to spend their own money and borrow money cheaply to provide houses. That is one instance. I will send the Deputy and the other leaders a copy of Mr. Tusk's letter and the response. I hope we can make some headway on it, given that it applies not only in Ireland but also in a number of countries which are concerned about it.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	148	The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union creates considerable challenges for the agrifood sector. The United Kingdom is by far our largest trading partner. Last year we exported almost â¬5.1 billion worth of agricultural products. This included more than â¬1.1 billion in beef products and almost â¬970 million in dairy products. Ireland is also the United Kingdom's largest destination for its food exports which were worth â¬3.8 billion last year. This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs. It is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the United Kingdom is a significant net contributor. Given these linkages and as the United Kingdom is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship. The resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up in years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the European Union and the United Kingdom. These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and during this period existing arrangements will continue to apply. Nevertheless, my Department had engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the United Kingdom's decision. The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on euro-sterling exchange rates. It should be noted that the fall in the value of sterling against the euro, while significant, is not unprecedented. Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern. In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result. It will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions on potential risks. Actions by the European Central Bank, ECB, and other global actors will be monitored closely. I have asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and BIM, to provide practical guidance for SMEs. Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies to maintain their competitiveness. Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland. Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the United Kingdom is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the United Kingdomâs departure is completed. In the meantime and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted. I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues I have mentioned. I have convened a consultative committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed. I am ensuring the response of the relevant agencies is fully co-ordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee. The Department will continue to feed into the central contingency framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.

I do not need to tell the Minister about the tremendous concern in the farming community about the potential impact. Deputies Jackie Cahill and Bobby Aylward and I have met a number of the farming organisations and others involved in the sector during recent weeks and there is real concern about how it may play out. This concern was exacerbated by comments during the past week or two by the German Economy Minister, when he indicated that there would probably be a reduction in the CAP budget as a result of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. The CAP Is a crucial cornerstone of the agriculture sector in Ireland and throughout Europe. In Ireland 130,000 farm families depend on it and two thirds of net income comes from CAP payments. What steps has the Minister taken, or will he take, particularly in engaging with his German and French counterparts, to ensure the CAP budget will be secure and that there will not be a threat hanging over it? Will there be any further comment from Ministers such as we heard during the past week on protecting its budget?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	150	Given that the United Kingdom is a net contributor to the European Union, its departure, whenever it is finalised, will have consequences from that date forward for the CAP. The financial arrangements underpinning the current CAP are secure until a new CAP is negotiated in 2020. We are very conscious of the implications. I will be meeting the French Agriculture Minister in late August in Paris to discuss all of the consequences arising from post-Brexit issues. Notwithstanding the comments of the German Agriculture Minister, it is important that we do not raise fears that are not real. There is no threat to immediate funding under the CAP. I am very much aware of the significant funding we draw down in direct payments and areas of natural constraint and under the rural development programme. These payments are secure in the current CAP budget. It is likely to be at least two years, possibly longer, before the United Kingdom manages to extricate itself legally from membership of the European Union.However, the current budget is secure, notwithstanding the comments by the German agriculture Minister.

Is he saying there is no threat whatsoever to the CAP budget between now and 2020 and that the pot will remain as it is regardless of whether Britain exits in the meantime and its payments are withdrawn? Has that been clearly indicated to him, or confirmed to him, at European Council level or is that his own sense of this from within the Department? The Minister indicated he will meet his French counterpart in August. What are his plans regarding engagement with the German Government because Germany and France are big players in respect of the future of CAP? Has he plans to meet his German counterpart, particularly in light of the concerning comments made by the German economic Minister? When is the mid-term review likely to take place? When is it due to commence?

The Commissioner has not decided whether that will happen. I met the German agriculture Minister last month at the Council meeting and I will meet him again next Monday morning. There is a great deal of concern in the broader Community about Brexit and there are issues of substance to be dealt with but I urge all stakeholders, and there are many both inside and outside the farm gate, to remain focused because a lot of loose talk can generate the instability to which the market reacts. Whereas I do not wish to underestimate in any way the significance of the issues and the challenges, not least because of our market dependence and complications such as Ireland having the only land border following the departure of the UK, which will be significant, something I have asked my officials to engage with the Northern Ireland Minister on, it is important that we do not overstate the concerns we have to deal with in such a way that they exacerbate the issue in the marketplace which poses the most immediate challenge, which is currency fluctuations.

These inspections address a range of issues in relation to land eligibility, scheme specific eligibility and other EU regulatory requirements. The basis for the inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually. These inspections are a necessary requirement to draw down approximately â¬1.5 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances.  The legal case to which the Deputy refers has not yet reached its ultimate conclusion, and, as the matter progresses - I understand it will be finalised on 28 July - I will obtain legal advice, as appropriate, on the wide range of complex legal issues involved. Accordingly, any issues arising as a result of the legal case can only be addressed following the completion of this legal process.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	155	This case went through the courts on 2 June. The farmer in question lodged an appeal to the Department. When officials came out to his farm, they did not fulfil the regulations set out by the Department and the EU. If the shoe was on the other foot and the farmer had not fulfilled the regulations, we know what would have happened. As the court said, this farmer has to be compensated for his losses because his appeal was not dealt with properly. Hundreds of other farmers are in a similar position. They did not receive a control report, which was supposed to be provided, and this is at the nub of the case. Many of them are examining their positions and saying they had a fair case which was not dealt with properly and they did not get the fair play they felt they deserved. Now they want to know whether they can apply to get their money back and to be compensated for their losses. If the shoe was on the other foot, the Department would do so. Will the Minister commit to repaying them for their losses as a result of this failure?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	156	I am acutely aware of the interest the issue has raised among many farmers, not least farmers in my constituency who have spoken to me about the implications, with them having been on the receiving end of departmental disallowances, fines, increased fines on review etc. The judgment goes to the heart of the process about the failure of the Department to issue a control report prior to imposing penalties. However, before we are in a position to conclude on what the spillover consequences will be for any other farmer, we need to have the finality of the judge's decision and that will be published on 28 July. We have the broad substantial outline of his judgment and I will not hide behind the ultimate qualifications which he may make. Much of the commentary will be in respect of costs etc., but there are other issues on which parties have been invited to make submissions that can be considered by the judge before he makes his final deliberations on the matter. I am acutely conscious that many farmers feel aggrieved by the process. Whatever the consequences of the case, the Department has to operate within the law, and if we require further clarification of the law, so be it. We await the final decision and I am acutely aware of the heightened level of interest in the farming community in the matter. However, the Deputy will understand that until I have the ultimate interpretation of the judge's ruling, I cannot comment in detail or, indeed, raise expectations of farmers who feel they may have been aggrieved by the issues raised in the court case. This afternoon, legal advisers from my Department are meeting senior counsel to explore all the consequences of the ruling
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	157	It is disappointing that we are in this position. The judge stated, "The lack of respect for fair procedures was extended to the review when other penalties were imposed without any opportunity given to the applicant to make submissions in advance of the imposition of an extra penalty." In other words, when the appeal was lodged and the officials visited the farmer to conduct the review, not only did they uphold the first penalty but they imposed a second penalty on the farmer. That is the case for many farmers throughout the country. While I acknowledge the Minister said farmers feel aggrieved, they also feel vindicated by this case. The Department has many questions to answer in this regard. If farmers are obliged to do something for the Department to secure a grant, strict time limits are set and they must do it this way, that way or the other way. I have experience of this on many occasions. Every hurdle is set in their way, yet when the Department does something, officials seem to be able ride roughshod over everybody. That sense of officialdom always winning out has been challenged and defeated in the courts on this occasion. It would be a measure of due respect to the entire farming community if the Minister simply put his two hands up and said the Department was totally wrong in this case and it will look after the farmer.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	158	The Department has many responsibilities in this area. One is to secure the level of payments we get annually from the Commission. The amount is â¬1.5 billion across the various schemes. Prior to the Deputy's arrival in the House, but in the not too distant past, the State incurred fines of almost â¬70 million for not adequately policing EU schemes. This hit affected the entire farming community. While fair procedures must be ensured, we must also abide by the accountability process to which we are subject in respect of public funds the EU gives us under the CAP. This must be done fairly and I acknowledge the court's decision in this regard. We will study it, and if there are spillover consequences in respect of other decisions the Department has made, we will have to consider how the judgment impacts on them. However, it is a little premature at this stage. We await the judge's final comments on 28 July and there are meetings this afternoon in the Department between senior counsel and senior officials in my Department to study all the implications of the judgment. I acknowledge it is a significant issue in which farmers are interested. Many of them feel they would have been unfairly treated. We will have to see the implications, if any, of the judgment in this respect.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	159	The new programme for Government commits to the introduction of a scheme for sheep farmers under the rural development programme, with a budget of â¬25 million to be provided in budget 2017. This scheme, in addition to the existing supports available to sheep farmers under the basic payment scheme, the green low-carbon argi-environment scheme, GLAS, the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability of the sheep sector in Ireland. This commitment is a clear acknowledgement of the contribution the sheepmeat sector makes to the agrifood economy, generating an output value of â¬320 million in 2015 and supporting 34,000 farm families directly, as well as providing several thousand jobs indirectly in rural areas. As regards the specifics of the scheme design and operation, my Department has engaged in extensive consultation with farm organisations. In addition, two weeks ago they met officials of the European Commission to discuss the proposed new scheme in the context of the specific requirements of the rural development programme. Any such scheme must comply with the rural development regulation. My officials are working on the final details of the scheme in the light of these consultations. The scheme is being proposed as an animal welfare scheme under Article 33 of the rural development regulation. All eligible actions will have to be linked with improving animal welfare conditions for applicant flocks and payments will be calibrated to compensate farmers for costs incurred or income forgone as a result of such actions. Eligible actions must be verifiable and controllable and must go beyond the normal standards of husbandry practice.  My objective is to ensure the scheme is administratively simple, both for applicants and my Department, complies with EU regulations, makes a real contribution to the development of the sector and is available to the maximum possible number of participants, including both lowland and hill sheep farmers.

It is very necessary because incomes in the sheep sector have been under pressure in recent years and we have also seen a reduction in flock numbers, something which needs to be arrested. The average income of a sheep farm family is just over â¬15,000, of which a very high proportion, not far off 100%, is made up of farm payments. Will the Minister elaborate further on the structure of the new scheme? It is crucial that the mistakes made with the beef data and genomics programme which was regarded by farmers as being particularly cumbersome, leading to a lower take-up than had been predicted, are not repeated. Will the Minister comment on the requests made to him by hill farmers, in particular, for a â¬5 top-up payment and the need for a single menu? Is this something he is considering and plans to introduce, particularly in the light of the fact that the sector has been much less profitable in recent years, particularly for hill sheep farmers?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	161	I do not want to get dragged into a cul-de-sac, but it is interesting to note that, with respect to the aforementioned beef data and genomics scheme which I believe will do for the beef sector what the electronic identification, EID, scheme has done for the dairy sector, there is a huge demand to have it reopened to new applicants. I do not believe it is flawed but that, over time, it will prove itself as regards the merits of the beef herd in terms of genetics and climate control measures. It is a signficant scheme. I acknowledge the allocation of â¬25 million for the scheme and appreciate the interest and co-operation of the Deputy. We have discussed the matter both off-camera and in the Chamber previously. It represents a significant investment in the sector, but not to over-egg it, it is relatively small in terms of what can be achieved in ewe numbers. The sector has waited long enough in the queue for such recognition.  I am very anxious to have a practical scheme that will take account of on-farm management practices on both lowland and hill sheep farms. The menu of options farmers will be invited to buy into will reflect the range of management practices followed. I have met representatives of hill sheep farmers and the IFA. I have also discussed the matter witth Macra na Feirme and the ICMSA. My Department has had even more extensive consultations on these matters. I do not propose to have a top-up payment. An across-the-board payment will be made to all those involved, but the menu of options will take account of the different management structures in place on individual farms.

When does he expect to receive final approval for the scheme and to complete the process of engagement with Brussels in signing off on the range of options to be offered and the structure and make-up of the scheme? He has indicated that he is not looking at the option of having a top-up payment for those involved in hill sheep farming sector, in particular. Will he elaborate on his reasons for not going down that route in the light of the fact that the hill sheep farming sector indicates that welfare measures can be more costly in their implementation for hill sheep farms and the fact that the sector has been operating at a loss for the past year or two? Will there be one menu from which sheep farmers will be able to choose regarding the range of the welfare options available or does the Minister plan to introduce two menus for lowland and hill sheep farmers?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	163	My ambition is to have payments made in 2017 as per the commitment made in the programme for Government and, therefore, to conclude the negotiations with the Commission. In that respect, I appreciate that sometimes we await decisions from the Commission and that sometimes we have to finalise the paperwork. We have a broad outline of the scheme and are discussing the detail with the Commission. That process will continue, but I hope to get Commission approval in 2016 and be in a position to invite applications, if not late this year, certainly early in 2017 with a view making payments at the earliest possible date thereafter. What I am aiming to achieve with the scheme is that it will include a menu of options that will reflect the different management practices associated with either lowland or hill sheep farming and that, therefore, there will not be additional costs incurred by hill sheep as opposed to lowland sheep farmers in the suite of options available. The necessity for a top-up payment would not arise because there would be appropriate measures in place for hill and lowland sheep farmers.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	164	Following an exposÃ© in The Guardian newspaper late last year about the extreme exploitation of undocumented non-EU migrant crew members on Irish fishing vessels, 500 atypical worker permits were to be made availble to the owners of these vessels. Will the Minister advise how many of these permits have so far been applied for; the ports in which the applicant vessel owners are based; the number of fishing crew at each port; and the countries of origin of migrant fishing crews?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	165	The report of the Governmentâs interdepartmental task force on Non-EEA workers in the fishing industry recommended the establishment of a sector-specific atypical worker permission system which would provide a structured and transparent framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the commercial sea-fishing fleet. This system is an extension of the existing atypical worker permission schemes administered by the Department of Justice and Equality through the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS. The granting of permission to work in the State under the scheme is a matter for decision by the INIS. My Departmentâs role in the Department of Justice and Equality scheme is limited solely to hosting a central depository, the specific purpose of which is to provide an Internet based system that facilitates applications for pre-approval under the atypical working scheme; process pre-approval applications received from applicants, certified by solicitors, who subsequently seek to apply to the INIS for an atypical working scheme, crew member, permit;  issue a unique identifier for each eligible contract that meets the scheme criteria; communicate the unique identifier detail to the INIS; maintain a central depository of eligible contracts of employment; and monitor the ceiling of 500 pre-approvals in any 12-month period. The central depository does not retain information on the ports in which the applicant vessel owners are based or the number of fishing crew at each port. As of the week ending 8 July, the central depository had processed 159 contracts. The countries of origin of these 159 crew members are as follows: 83 are from Egypt; 57 are from the Philippines; nine are from Ghana; seven are from Indonesia; two are from Ukraine and one is from Sri Lanka. I have been informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that it has granted atypical worker permission to 131 applicants.  I advise the Deputy that if he requires further information on the scheme to make direct contact with Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	166	So, the answer to the big question is "159". It was agreed to make 500 permits available but five months - not five days or five weeks - after the deadline, fewer than one third have been issued. The initial reaction of the representatives of the fishing industry to the reports in The Guardian was to deny the magnitude of the problem. They did that in debate with Ken Fleming of the International Transport Federation. From a position of initial Government denial, the then-Minister, Deputy Coveney, whose Department published a report which estimated that 48% of people working in the industry were non-EU migrants, which would be more than 1,000, agreed to provide not 1,000 but 500 permits. Now, only 159 have been applied for. That fewer than 160 applications have been made five months after the original deadline can only be interpreted as two fingers from the industry to workers' rights and a shameful indictment of all of the enforcement authorities which have been provided with more than enough concrete evidence of specific instances by Mr. Fleming of the ITF.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	167	That is one interpretation and I am not surprised it is the one the Deputy takes of it. There is another interpretation which is that while there is room for substantially more applications with the industry being entitled to apply for up to 500 atypical worker permits, the problem is not as widespread as might have appeared in the first instance. The 159 applications might suggest as much, although the Deputy might like to explore the matter further with the INIS. I remind the Deputy that the task force established to consider the matter consisted of representatives of the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Justice and Equality, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Social Protection, and Defence, the Workplace Relations Commission, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Marine Survey Office, the Health and Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners, BIM, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Naval Service, the Office of the Attorney General and An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na. There is no anxiety on this side or among the State agencies to exploit workers of any origin unfairly in the fishing industry. We have put in place a system that allows workers to regularise their situation where they are within the industry but are not documented. The atypical worker permit gives them the rights any worker has in terms of entitlement to wages and contracts, etc. While I appreciate the slant the Deputy may wish to put on the 159 applications, it might also suggest that the problem is not as great as the Deputy at first anticipated.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	168	The Minister says there is no desire to exploit, but is there a desire to turn a blind eye? I have reports here from the International Transport Federation which indicate clearly what is going on. I will present them to the Minister straight after the debate. There is no problem about that. The International Transport Federation enjoys the right in other countries to inspect vessels. It is willing to provide that service here at no cost to the State. Clearly, it is more motivated to sort out exploitation there than the Garda, NERA and, especially, the Marine Safety Office. Does the Minister agree that the International Transport Federation should be granted inspection rights here?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	169	Many thousands of people work in the fishing industry at sea and in the processing sector who have valued and secure employment within a legal framework. The State is the ultimate guarantor of the legal framework within which they operate and has no vested interest in allowing the exploitation of any worker in that framework. I appreciate that Deputy Barry may not be a supporter of the State in all of its manifestations, but all of the necessary arms of the State were involved in the working group dealing with this matter. The State does not need an international body to assist it in policing working conditions or the rights of employees.

The necessary authorities were involved in the working group. If the Deputy has specific issues he wishes to bring to the attention of the appropriate authorities within the State, he should do so, but he should please not cast aspersions on the bona fides of people who work at the coal face of the industry, go to sea, land their catches and have them processed in the republic, creating very valuable employment in so doing.

Does the Minister have an update in that regard? Has a quota been secured? If so, will he ensure that it is allocated to vessels under 10 m in length?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	176	There are two herring stocks in the north west area and there have been, correspondingly, two separate International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, total allowable catch, TAC, areas. Ireland has a share in both TAC areas. Following a benchmarking exercise in 2015, ICES found that while there are two separate herring stocks, it is not possible to segregate them in commercial catches or surveys. ICES considers that both stocks are depleted and recommended a zero total allowable catch for 2016. Following the provision of advice by the Marine Institute, Ireland sought at the 2015 December Council a small commercial TAC for both VIa north and VIa south in 2016 to avoid the loss of scientific data for these areas and to prevent gaps in the time series. The Commission agreed to seek additional scientific advice on the elements needed for a small commercial fishery, including the timing and geographical areas, with a view to setting a small commercial total allowable catch and quotas. Last week, a draft proposal was circulated by the Commission suggesting a total allowable catch of 4,840 tonnes with 1,360 tonnes in VIa south and 3,480 tonnes in VIa north. At the request of Ireland and the UK, the Commission is currently examining the case for a slightly higher combined total allowable catch of 5,800 tonnes with the same proportional split. This proposal was made on the basis that it would pose no additional risk to the stocks and would make it more likely that the necessary data would be acquired by making the fishery more economically attractive. As soon as the total allowable catch and quotas have been set, I will consider quota management for 2016 and whether there is a case to amend the quota management policy in place on an exceptional basis, taking into account that the quota available will be small and is being made available to support the collection of scientific data. Any proposed amendment will be subject to consultation with stakeholders.

Will the Minister outline the timeframe for deciding on the additional requested quota and whether that will delay things much more? The Minister's predecessor stated specifically that a good proportion of the quota would be ring-fenced for small-scale fishermen in the inshore sector with particular reference to fishing vessels under 10 m in length. That is vital. While the quota is small, it represents a significant income for fishermen at that scale and would be of most value to them. The quota would not be of much commercial use to larger-scale fishing vessels due to the costs involved in catching the fish. It is vital to ring-fence the quota for small vessels under 10 m in length. I urge the Minister to ensure that the regulations are implemented to reflect that.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	178	I am aware of the broad interest in the herring quota which has been fished by boats of all sizes. The Deputy makes the point well on smaller vessels.In the context of the exceptionally small quota that has been proposed, there is a case for considering amended arrangements focusing on the inshore fleet. We must first await the outcome of the request that we made to the Commission. I hope that it is finalised sooner rather than later. If there this is to be a 2016 quota, we need to get the arrangements in place. If we are to amend the apportionment of quota arrangements vis-Ã -vis inshore fishermen, we must engage in consultation on the process sooner rather than later. I hope for a definitive word from the Commission, which would allow us to enter consultation with a view as to how the quota is reallocated.

Could the Minister not consult on the basis of the 4,800 tonnes that were initially granted so as to start the process earlier and enable people to avail of the quota? I presume that the National Inshore Fisheries Forum will be a part of the consultation on the quota allocation. That would be important. I cannot understate the importance of smaller vessels and the inshore fleet availing of the quota if their viability is to be ensured.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	180	I have met the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, which gave an interesting presentation on a range of issues, including this one. It will be a part of any consideration of how the quota is allocated. I am conscious of the fact that if we do not get this matter over the line by the end of July, the Commission will go into hibernation for August. The clock is ticking and I am anxious to have the issue finalised soon. I do not want to give a specific timeframe, as I appreciate the logistics of getting a final word from the Commission, consulting and people being told of their entitlements within what is a relatively small quota allocation. When I am in Brussels next Monday, I hope to have an opportunity to progress this matter.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	181	The actions in question were undertaken under the overall control of the official assignee in bankruptcy acting as an officer of the court, who has stated publicly that the decision to proceed in the way he did in respect of the cattle was made reluctantly and in the interests of the public safety of the local community. It should also be noted that the cattle were at the time in the ownership of the official assignee, into whose name the herd number had been transferred, and that the herd in question was TB restricted on 18 February due to the disclosure of TB lesions in cattle slaughtered from the herd. Significant efforts had been made to contain the animals, but these proved futile because of their feral nature. In the interests of public safety, the official assignee, in consultation with the Garda and the Department, considered that the optimal course of action to be taken was for the animals to be euthanised. The protocol agreed between my Department and the Department of Defence was invoked and the animals were subsequently killed by skilled Army personnel in line with it. It is the view of my Department that the actions taken were the most humane in the circumstances and I am advised that there was no alternative action available to the official assignee in the circumstances, taking account of the fact that the interest of public safety was the primary consideration at all times.

Given the size of the national herd, I find it difficult to believe, and many people found it shocking, that these cattle could have gone feral in the first instance and that expertise was not available, in particular to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to gather up the cattle and have them removed from the farm without their needing to be shot by the Defence Forces. For how long was the official assignee responsible for the herd? How was he managing the herd in the run-up to this situation? There should have been another way of dealing with it that was not as visible and shocking to many people as seeing soldiers in fields shooting cattle. Will the Minister examine whether the Department could have had the expertise to address the situation more efficiently?

How often do the Defence Forces act at the request of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in such cases? Was a departmental vet present? Do the Defence Forces receive training in how to handle such situations? Are they always under the charge of departmental personnel when they are called on to aid the civil power in cases where livestock is the focus?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	184	Deputy Clare Daly is correct, in that there is more to this than meets the eye, although some weekend publications gave a pretty accurate summation of the bigger picture. The Department is not in the business of shooting cattle. In any circumstance, it is the last resort. For this reason, there is an official protocol. This was invoked by the official assignee in consultation with my Departmentâs veterinary office in Cavan. Departmental veterinary inspectors and local gardaÃ­ were involved. On at least four occasions, unsuccessful efforts were made to round up the cattle. There were other instances in which locks on gates were tampered with and cattle were on the public road. The area is near the Carrickmacross-Dundalk road. In trying to manage the herd, the assigneeâs concerns about public safety escalated because of incidents. I appreciate that the outcome was a sight that no one wanted to behold, but what if the cattle had caused a serious, even fatal, accident on the public road? My Department would have equally been in the dock. It was a no-win situation but, in the assignee invoking the protocol and the participation of the Garda, my Departmentâs veterinary service and the Defence Forces, there are sufficient checks and balances to ensure that this is not something that is done lightly. I am not aware of when the protocol was last invoked. It is certainly not a routine occurrence. It is not an annual occurrence. We would have to search our records to see when it was last invoked. I will try to find that additional information for the Deputy. Given the considerable public interest in this matter, I assure the House that the protocol is a last resort for the Department. We do not use it lightly. Associated matters surrounding the appropriate management of the farm and the ability or otherwise of the assignee to manage the process effectively in extraneous circumstances led to this event occurring. It was regrettable, but ultimately necessary for the protection of public safety.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	185	Food Wise 2025, the new ten-year strategy for the agrifood sector published last July, replaced Food Harvest 2020. It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper. Food Wise 2025 includes more than 400 specific recommendations spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness, as well as specific sectoral recommendations. The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success. I chair the Food Wise high-level implementation committee, HLIC, with high-level representatives from all relevant Departments and State agencies. The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis in order to identify and solve problems quickly. Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes and, by the end of this year, the HLIC will have reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the 12 individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025. As such, it is very much a live and continuously updated process. For example, the HLIC convened following the UK vote to leave the EU to agree on a co-ordinated approach for the agrifood sector. I today launched a first year progress report on Food Wise 2025, entitled "Steps to Success 2016".Of the 414 actions in the Food Wise implementation plan, 330 were due to commence in 2015 or 2016. Of these 330 actions, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken, and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well. Food Wise 2025 stressed the need for my Department, other Departments and State agencies to work collaboratively, and I am pleased to say this is occurring. Some of these collaborations are reported in Steps to Success 2016. I would like to emphasise the following successes from year one of this ten-year strategy. Bord Biaâs The Thinking House, which opened in June, will be a world-class consumer insight and innovation centre. The meat technology centre, hosted in the Teagasc food research centre, Ashtown, will be an internationally leading centre of excellence for meat processing research and innovation. I am pleased to announce that in 2017 we will launch a major initiative focusing on improving grassland management use and profitability. The Department will establish a committee with representatives from the agencies and relevant stakeholders to plan a year-long programme of events. It will celebrate and build on Irelandâs comparative advantage in sustainable grass-feed production. A detailed report on the status of Food Wise 2025 actions is available on my Departmentâs website together with the progress report for the first year.

There was a target to increase milk production by another 20% on top of the existing target of 50% envisaged as a result of Food Harvest 2020. Considering that the past year has been a very difficult one for dairy producers, how does the Minister envisage the targets being achieved over the coming years? There is a target to increase the value of agrifood exports by 85%, to â¬19 billion, over the next ten years. This is very ambitious. Does the Minister believe the target can be achieved in view of the challenges facing the beef and dairy sectors? Additional challenges have emerged in recent weeks with Brexit. There will be serious sectoral challenges and uncertainty over the value of sterling. How does the Minister envisage the targets being achieved? Were they too ambitious initially?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	187	I do not believe the targets were too ambitious. They were compiled by all the stakeholders together. Food Wise 2025 is, in fact, the industryâs document. It involves the collaboration of the industry both inside and outside the farm gate. Therefore, the plans are not overly ambitious. In the context of difficulties we are facing owing to Brexit and fluctuating commodity prices, as alluded to by the Deputy, I do not believe it is a time to lose our nerve. One response to the challenges that exist is to diversify the range of markets into which we sell. On the dairy side, for example, China has in a very short space of time become our second largest market destination after the United Kingdom. My Department is continually attempting to seek new market opportunities in order that we can lower the risk if any particular market runs into difficulty. We have discussed this previously on Question Time. We face specific difficulties associated with currency fluctuations in the UK market but, at the same time, the euro has weakened relative to the dollar. Therefore, in dollar-denominated markets, we have opportunities arising. It is a time in which to hold our nerve regarding our ambitions, which are significant and can be achieved over a ten-year horizon while acknowledging the present difficulties. The UK beef market is the best market to be in. I will be leading an effort to diversify our product in this regard. We will be going to China and south-east Asia in September. In the past two weeks, the US market for beef for grinding opened up. This is a significant step in the right direction. Some 80% of beef consumed in the United States is beef ground for mincemeat or burgers. We were already in the US market for prime cuts but this is a significant breakthrough. It is now up to the industry. Now that the market has opened, it faces a significant challenge to avail itself of market opportunities presented in that context. What is important is that Food Wise 2025 is the industryâs document. The Department is obviously a facilitator in terms of the industryâs ambition. In the post-quota era, we have harnessed it collectively to achieve very significant targets in terms of export earnings and job creation. The jobs are, by and large, in rural areas. It is important that we continue to have faith in the industry to achieve the targets.

We should be emphasising and concentrating on that advantage further. What are we doing to ensure our competitive advantage is maintained? There is no doubt job creation in the industry is very significant. Over the recent difficult years, agriculture was key to rebuilding this economy. We have to diversify. Diversification is important in the industry and we need to create more jobs. A good news story in recent years has been the re-emergence of distilleries and breweries. We need to concentrate on them. I recently attended the opening of a new brewery in my area. Some â¬25 million was invested, and the brewery will employ 60 people in a rural area. This will be very beneficial, but we need to maintain a competitive advantage and to be concentrating on these issues.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	191	Questions relating to the release of the person referred to by the Deputy are a matter primarily for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In this regard, I understand his Department, both in Dublin and Cairo, is actively engaged in seeking a resolution in this case, as is the Taoiseach. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, gave a comprehensive speech to the House last Thursday, 7 July, on this matter. I understand Deputy Clare Daly also contributed to the debate which resulted in an all-party motion being passed by this House. My Department has had no involvement in this consular case. The Irish Government has not finalised a deal with the Egyptian Government on the sale of live cattle to Egypt. However, veterinary officials from the Egyptian General Organization for Veterinary Services conducted a technical visit to Ireland in February to determine the suitability of Irelandâs animal health controls and agree a veterinary health certificate for the export of live cattle to Egypt. The protection of farm incomes is a key plank of A Programme for a Partnership Government, and in this context there is a specific commitment to prioritise and develop new live export opportunities to provide farmers with alternative markets. This is particularly important in light of the pressure on the incomes of the 100,000 farm families involved in the production of beef, the prospect of increased cattle numbers in the latter half of 2016 and the potential for this and other market factors to exert downward pressure on farm incomes. The outcome of the visit in question was the recognition by the Egyptian veterinary authorities of Irelandâs veterinary health certificate. This will allow Irish operators to export to Egypt, subject to the normal exigencies of the marketplace, and may provide a potentially valuable alternative market outlet to hard-pressed farm families. I reiterate that questions in regard to this important and sensitive consular case are a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

There is a certain doublespeak in the attitude of the Irish Government. On the one hand, we are passing motions stating the manner in which the Irish citizen is being dealt with is terrible but, on the other, we continue to do business with and turn a blind eye to what is, in essence, a brutal regime. The Minister made the point that the protection of farming is a key part of the programme for Government. Is that at any cost? With regard to farming per se, we could have alternatives to the exportation of livestock, for example. With regard to the publication of the Amnesty International report today, Mr. Colm O'Gorman was on the airwaves expressing concern over the fact that many countries continue to maintain close diplomatic trade and other ties with countries without prioritising human rights. This is simply not good enough. As Mr. O'Gorman stated, we should be using our influence to pressurise Egypt into ending these appalling violations that are being committed under the false pretexts of security and counterterrorism. It is regrettable that the Minister would not do that.

While I respect Deputy Clare Daly's concern about the Halawi case, all the countries with which we trade have flaws. In developing live exports, the approach to the pooling of cattle is causing problems for dealers and purchasers of livestock. They would like the Department to take a more relaxed approach to the way in which cattle are collected because the current approach is causing problems.

The Government and its predecessor have left no stone unturned in this case. Notwithstanding some of the public commentary and finger-pointing that has taken place, the Government, both individually and collectively, is as committed to the release of Ibrahim Halawa as any other Member of the House.

The Deputy can frown as much as she likes but she should not impugn my motives or those of any other Member. On a human level, we are concerned as anyone else is about the fate of Ibrahim Halawa. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, and the Taoiseach have raised this issue at every opportunity. If Deputy Coppinger believes it is appropriate for veterinary officials in my Department to raise this issue with veterinary officials in the corresponding Egyptian department, she fails to comprehend how best to pursue the release of Ibrahim Halawa.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	199	I tabled this question and I assure the Minister I am not being in any way mean-spirited. Like my colleague who spoke last week, I do not doubt that, on a personal level, Government representatives are absolutely committed to the release of Ibrahim Halawa. However, the point we were trying to make last week was that the tactics the Government has employed in trying to secure that end have not yet worked. The Government is sending mixed signals by making representations, while continuing to do business as usual. The comparison we made was with the Australian Government, which adopted a much more hardline attitude in a case involving an Australian citizen. The Australian embassy in Cairo made clear that the case would have ramifications for Egypt in terms of trade with Australia and the country's reputation. The point we are making is that mixed signals are being sent and it is utterly appropriate to use trade and influence to deliver human rights. That is not a mealy-mouthed contribution to the debate.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	200	I spoke recently to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on this matter and also when he was a Minister in the previous Government. While I appreciate the point Deputy Clare Daly makes, there is no monopoly of wisdom on this matter. We must make judgment calls on how best to pursue the interests of Ibrahim Halawa whose case would not be best served by disadvantaging Irish agriculture. That would not advance the process one iota in terms of bringing forward Mr. Halawa's release date. We must maintain the maximum possible diplomatic, consular and political pressure. A dialogue on the issue between the veterinary service of my Department and its counterpart in Egypt is not an appropriate mechanism for pursuing the interests of Ibrahim Halawa.

I am sure the Minister is aware of concerns surrounding this issue. Three renowned animal welfare organisations, the ISPCA, the Irish Blue Cross and Dogs Trust Ireland, wrote to his predecessor expressing concerns about the export of three greyhounds to Macau.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	202	As stated in a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by the Deputy on 17 May last, the position is that once appropriate animal health and welfare certification requirements are met, dogs, including greyhounds, may be exported internationally. Exporters are also required to comply with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport. I emphasise that while a very small number of greyhounds were exported to Macau earlier this year, it is nevertheless imperative to ensure the transport of greyhounds over long distances is conducted in a manner which safeguards the welfare of animals being transported and minimises the risk of transmitting infectious diseases. Bord na gCon is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in the Republic as well as the well-being of greyhounds. The board has developed a comprehensive code of practice on the welfare of greyhounds which sets out specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet. The code emphasises that owners and keepers take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice. On 23 May, departmental officials met representatives of Bord na gCon and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum, which was represented by the ISPCA and Dogs Trust in Ireland, to consider the issues surrounding the export of greyhounds. At that meeting, the officials emphasised that the well-being of greyhounds, including their physical and social environment, is at the core of Irelandâs greyhound industry and the need for the industry to comply with the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the associated code of practice, which sets out clearly specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet.  Bord na gCon has reiterated its advice to all owners involved in the export of greyhounds to only export to destinations that provide the expected levels of care and management, as defined in the board's code of practice for the welfare of greyhounds. I fully endorse this view. The Minister met representatives of the ISPCA on 29 June last. On the specific issue of Macau, the ISPCA recalled the positive engagement of the International Greyhound Forum on this issue. I understand that trade with Macau has ceased and I am confident that greyhound owners heeded the advice being offered by Bord na gCon.

Does this mean the Department will introduce a ban on the export of greyhounds to China because a ban is the only safeguard animal welfare organisations are willing to accept? The export of greyhounds to countries known to have a poor record on animal welfare is ill advised and a major step backgrounds for those seeking a well-regulated greyhound industry. I have been contacted by a man who has followed the case involving the export of greyhounds to a track in Macau. He states that the track involved is old and narrow and its length is not good for animals. Many accidents happen, which results in dogs being killed and more being needed to replace them. He notes also that dogs cannot be brought in from China as they must be quarantined for rabies, which is impossible because of the lack of space. The individual in question states that approximately 30 dogs per month die in the Macau racetrack. No one in Ireland would support allowing the export of greyhounds to this race track. People want reassurance on this matter.

If the Department tried to ban greyhound exports to Macau, the animals would be transported to the region indirectly through another jurisdiction if the people involved wished to continue to export them. I appreciate everything the Deputy said on animal welfare. International pressure was brought to bear by people involved in the welfare of greyhounds and the airlines responded to it. Everyone should accept that if no mode of transport is available, no greyhounds will be exported.

From what I have read, the airlines involved were based at Heathrow Airport and their decision was not connected to the Department. Concerns were raised about the mode of transport used to export greyhounds. Deputies received an e-mail which indicated that people involved in animal welfare believed the Department was about to agree to amend the Welfare of Greyhounds Act and introduce changes to the greyhound industry to prevent the export of greyhounds to countries that do not have good welfare standards.This was something people were hoping to hear an announcement on. I do not think the Minister of State is in a position to make that announcement and that is rather disappointing.

While the fall in the value of sterling against the euro is significant, it is not unprecedented. Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern. In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result. The bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions with regard to potential risks. Actions by the European Central Bank and other global actors will be monitored closely. In addition, I have asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and BIM, to provide practical guidance to small and medium-sized enterprises. Last week, Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses. These measures include managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach. The aim is to help companies maintain their competitiveness. Similar support is being provided by Enterprise Ireland as well. I will continue to monitor the situation closely, in particular through the consultative committee of stakeholders that I established recently and which met for the first time last week. I will also ensure that the response of the agencies is fully co-ordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 high level implementation committee.

The Minister referred to what would happen if this continued for a sustained period. What constitutes a sustained period in terms of the actions of the Department? There is a need to be ready to intervene to assist businesses in a practical way, perhaps by supporting their exports rather than advice and leaving them to rely on Bank of Ireland to deal positively with people. This needs to be managed closely. I am somewhat concerned with the reference to the fluctuation lasting for a sustained period. The Department needs to be able to move quickly to react and support businesses in a very practical way, rather than simply offering market advice and support.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	209	Since the counting of the votes in the United Kingdom and the announcement that the UK was leaving, my Department has been proactive. Bord Bia and BIM have had engagement with their stakeholders and the companies they work with that export to the UK. The feedback of the high level implementation group on Food Wise 2025 has been interesting. The group includes agencies such as BIM, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia etc. Some feedback included concern emerging from their client companies. There was also feedback from their producers to the effect that price was an issue but also that quality and sustainability of the product was recognised as a significant factor in our favour. While we need to be vigilant in respect of all of these matters, particularly in respect of currency fluctuations, we need to be careful not to panic people in this situation as well. I appreciate that certain sectors are significantly exposed and we are working with these to try to manage the volatility in currency exchange rates. However, there are opportunities on the other side in dollar-denominated markets. They offer significant export opportunities in other areas that we are trying to exploit in terms of new market opportunities.

It takes time to open up those markets and feed in to them. There have been anecdotal stories of businesses having orders cancelled since the Brexit vote. This indicates the immediate impact. We need to be ready to step in and protect these businesses to keep them going if the current situation continues to take hold. I am concerned about the Minister's reference to a sustained period of fluctuation. What is a sustained period? If the devaluation continues or if it stays at this level for a longer period, how quickly can the Minister act? What can he actually do in practical terms to assist people?

This is something the industry has managed previously. I appreciate that it is painful for some as well as threatening in terms of feasibility for others. While we have to watch this space in terms of the range of policy instruments that we may have to invoke, at the moment I am satisfied in terms of my Department's reach to its client companies, through BIM and Bord Bia. We are monitoring the situation and keeping in contact not only with those companies but with substantial purchasers of Irish exports in the UK to try to ensure that we navigate successfully the immediate impact of the Brexit decision in currency fluctuation. On the other hand, we are preparing a range of contingency measures in respect of negotiating strategies etc. I am liaising with my counterpart in Northern Ireland in respect of cross-Border issues that will arise in the context of negotiations as well. I am satisfied that the dedicated unit in my Department and the reach the agencies have with their customers as well as the contingency planning under way in consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach are helping us to position ourselves in the best possible way to deal with the immediate and medium term issues that will arise in the context of the Brexit negotiations.

Clearly, those in Bord na gCon are failing the greyhound industry with their incompetence. They seem to have no regard for the integrity of the sport. The Government seems to support them no matter what and no matter how incompetent they are. I presume the Government will support them 100% until it chooses to support them 0%. It is rather frightening that irrespective of how bad and incompetent they are, the Government seems to stand by them.

The Morris report was carried out at the request of Bord na gCon by Professor Tim Morris, the independent scientific adviser to the Greyhound Board of Great Britain on anti-doping and medication control. The purpose of the report was to examine the use of doping and medication in the greyhound sector in Ireland. It will enable Bord na gCon to develop further its policy and regulation. The Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Bord na gCon welfare code of practice provide a strong framework for regulation and enforcement. Bord na gCon has made progress in tightening up on regulation in recent times. While publication of the report is a matter for Bord na gCon, it is my understanding that the board expects to publish the report within the coming weeks. Once the Morris report is published I will examine its recommendations to determine whether any further measures are required.

I find that really interesting. That is an interesting position for the Minister of State to take. Numerous people who own and train greyhounds in Ireland have contacted me in respect of drugs and greyhounds.They are disheartened that no proper procedure is in place. I cannot understand why the Government does not want the thing to be done right. Why is it acceptable to have a report for 12 months and not publish it?

I was Chairman of the committee in the last DÃ¡il that sought to have the new greyhound legislation brought before the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny. In the time since I became Minister of State about eight weeks ago, I have asked the officials who drafted the heads of that Bill to send it to the agriculture committee. I mentioned it before the Deputy came into the Chamber. I have had plenty of contact with all parties, including several that claim to represent the industry. I am trying to meet everybody who represents the industry. This group is not cohesive, as a collective, and work needs to be done. I am prepared to help make that happen. I am interested to ensure that the sector continues. The Morris report will be published and its findings will be acted upon. Some procedures are in place and there will be more. However, until the sector is given some shape, it is doing itself no favours.

When someone presented the greyhound, Loughlea Pretty, for a sales trial at Thurles greyhound stadium on 23 June 2015 with the prohibited substance flunixin, the only outcome was that the nature of the substance, flunixin, was noted and a minimum fine of â¬100 was applied. It is completely nonsensical. The testing cost more than the fine. The disciplinary committee of the Greyhound Board of Great Britain fined an Irish sales agent Â£2,000 in November 2015 and banned him for three months for the presence of the same prohibited substance. It is little wonder the British are recommending to their owners and trainers not to buy Irish dogs because they are drugged to the ears. That is what they have said. The trainer, Graham Holland, appeared before the Bord na gCon control committee meeting in May owing to the presence of the prohibited substance in four of his dogs. He was represented by a legal team and he got off scot free because he had a fucking legal presence. Another guy appeared before the committee over one dog. He did not have legal representation and was fined â¬100. What can be garnered from that is those with a legal presence will get away with anything, but without it they might pay a little fine.

The steps Bord na gCon has already taken are out-of-competition testing at kennels; publication of laboratory results where there is an adverse analytical finding; prohibition of a greyhound from racing where an adverse analytical finding has been made until a further test for prohibited substance has been carried out and the result is proved to be negative; establishment of a list of laboratories approved for the testing of B samples in place of the public analysis; and publication of control committee decisions along with the reasons for them.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	229	The decision of the UK to leave the European Union is one that creates considerable challenges for the agrifood sector. The UK is by far our largest trading partner. Last year we exported almost â¬5.1 billion worth of agricultural products. This included more than â¬1.1 billion in beef products and almost â¬970 million in dairy exports. Ireland is also the UKâs largest destination for its food exports, worth â¬3.8 billion last year. This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health, and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs. It is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. Given these linkages and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship. In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised. Together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, this will help us to negotiate our way through the challenges ahead. It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the European Union and the United Kingdom. These negotiations may take up to two years - perhaps longer - and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UKâs decision. The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on euro-sterling exchange rates. It should be noted that the fall in the value of sterling against the euro, while significant, is not unprecedented. Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern. In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result. The bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks. Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely. I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs. Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses. These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness. Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen relate to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and Customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. 
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UKâs departure is completed. In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely: I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned; I have convened a consultative committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed; I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully co-ordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 high level implementation committee; and the Department will continue to feed into the central contingency framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.

At that time he outlined some of his efforts to communicate with Northern Ireland farmers and others as his predecessor also did. Unfortunately, from an agriculture perspective we have got the result we did not want. The Minister has outlined some of the very good reasons we did not want it to happen and it will be a challenge for us. There is considerable concern among many farmers and businesspeople in the agriculture and food sector. I ask that those specific agriculture-related concerns are raised when the Taoiseach is meeting various European leaders. It is one of the strongest reasons for us needing special consideration for our position. The bloodstock industry, which is worth â¬1.1 billion to our economy, is inextricably linked to the UK in terms of our sales of foals and horses. Any changes to tariffs or borders with implications on trade would have a devastating impact on a bloodstock industry that is worth a huge amount to our economy and employs over 16,000 people. These are the key points that I am sure the Minister and his officials are bearing in mind.

Everybody talks about when the British will trigger article 50. My concern is the six months leading into it. It is like the sheriff being sent to a property and the person in trouble gets word of it - he could clear out the contents. That is my concern. There is a window of six months before the incoming British Prime Minister proposes to trigger article 50 and I am concerned that the damage could be caused by then regarding our trade deals etc. My question related to the milk sector in general. Over 12 months ago, organisations were putting the Government under pressure about collapsing milk prices. At that time it was barely above the cost of production at 28 cent or 29 cent a litre. Now the base price is 21 cent or 22 cent a litre. Farmers have gone very silent. They are not silent because they are doing well; they are silent because they are afraid to talk out. There is concern there. I go to agricultural shows around the county and one would know there is a problem there, but they are saying nothing. It is a new form of protest to say nothing. They are afraid that they are not being listened to. I ask that more emphasis be placed on the next six months as opposed to the period after that when the UK leaves the EU.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	232	I thank the Deputies for their questions. The Government has done a great deal of contingency planning for Brexit. This work has been done across all Departments and has been co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been representing the interests of the agrifood sector as it has been feeding into the Brexit contingency process. Those interests can be summed up by the fact that we export agricultural products worth â¬5.1 billion to the UK. We are doing everything we can at that level. We are very conscious that the immediate impact relates to the decrease in the value of sterling. I have dealt with that issue already. I acknowledge the point made by Deputy Heydon about bloodstock exports, in particular. This question was raised as a specific concern when I met representatives of the bloodstock industry yesterday. Obviously, we are very anxious to maintain such exports. The Department of the Taoiseach has been doing preparatory work. As the Deputy will appreciate, the Taoiseach visited Angela Merkel earlier in the week and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has met his German counterpart. I will be meeting my colleagues in the Council of Ministers. We are creating and elevating an awareness of the unique position we are in because of our relationship with the UK and our trading exposure there. Deputy O'Keeffe raised a few points about this matter as it affects the dairy side. This matter will be on the agenda at next Monday's meeting in Brussels of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I will be attending. We expect to receive from the Commissioner some proposals to assist the dairy industry. On previous occasions, we have successfully prosecuted the case for assistance at Commission level. My Department made payments earlier this year on foot of an announcement that was made in October 2015. That funding of â¬12.7 million was matched by â¬12.7 million in Exchequer funding. Deputy O'Keeffe will be interested to hear that these moneys went to both the dairy and pigmeat sectors. I appreciate that such approaches do not constitute an answer in themselves in light of the scale of the losses, especially this year when prices have decreased so significantly. Consideration must also be given in this context to the provision of direct aid, the bringing forward of single farm payments and the initiation of discussions with the banks. I accept the point made by Deputy O'Keeffe in the last case. I have met representatives of the three major banks - Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank - to create awareness of the fact that a cohort within the dairy industry is significantly exposed as a result of investments that have been made. I have to say my request for forbearance in that context received a good hearing from the banks. I appreciate that a perfect storm is brewing at the back end of this year when merchant credit, tax liabilities and superlevy bills will come together. We need that kind of forbearance from the banks. We are working within the leeway we have been given by the Commission to develop other financial packages that might assist farmers, particularly in the context of the difference between the cost of a package that we might be able to put together and the cost that is being paid at present for credit, especially merchant credit and short-term loan facilities from the banks. We are working on a range of issues.

I was about to make a point about the assistance that can be provided by financial institutions and others. It is good to see that the Minister is on top of such an approach. Will he outline whether any opportunities that Brexit might provide for the agricultural sector have been revealed during the contingency process? I appreciate that the opportunities in the financial services sector and other sectors are more obvious. We are trying to look for a silver lining in every cloud. Does the Department believe there are some areas in which Brexit might benefit the agricultural sector? I particularly welcome the Minister's comments on the bloodstock sector which, like the beef production sector, is a key area that is very vulnerable. It is important for the Government to take a co-ordinated approach. As the Minister has outlined, such an approach is being taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach and the officials in his own office.

On the issue of financing, would the Government be prepared to put in place a low-cost credit scheme under the state aid mechanism? Would that be possible? The Minister mentioned earlier that the CAP payments are secure for this duration, but I remind him that the mid-term CAP review is ongoing. The Minister and his colleagues have followed up the Food Harvest plan with Food Wise 2025. Farmers need to be able to look forward as regards projected incomes and sources of income from the EU. They need to know how they can make a living.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	235	While I appreciate that markets are extremely difficult on the dairy side at present, I remind the House that markets bounce back. The Brexit situation is complicating what was already a difficult situation, but the markets will recover. I do not want to predict when that will happen, but there are straws in the wind. I will not put it more strongly than that. We may have bottomed out and the recovery may be evident in 2017. That remains to be seen. It is important we do not add to the volatility in the market by making statements suggesting we are in a doomsday scenario. The market will recover. We will manage to ride out the sterling issues. If additional policy interventions and instruments are required, they will be considered by the Government in due course. We have been in this space - I refer to where sterling is today relative to the euro - on a number of occasions over the past ten years. I assure Deputy O'Keeffe that we are exploring the option of low-cost credit. I accept that our bank charges are out of kilter with the cost of credit internationally. We are working with organisations like the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to examine how this issue might be addressed. We are working on a range of fronts. I regret to tell Deputy Heydon that I do not see an upside of Brexit for the agriculture sector. We are trying to ensure our unique relationship with the UK and our dependence on the UK as a significant market is recognised during our negotiations on Brexit.

If this situation is not resolved, all of these people will be out of work from 1 January 2017. They will be unable to take up positions in Ireland or anywhere else in the world. It is intolerable that these people cannot be employed on any vessel anywhere until they get this certification in place. There seems to be some kind of stand-off between the Marine Survey Office, which is part of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the National Maritime College of Ireland. We need to get this resolved as quickly as possible. Many of these people cannot go anywhere else in the world to get these courses. They took these courses in good faith and expected that everything would be all right. It is intolerable that they have been left out in the cold in this manner. I implore the Minister to sort out this problem as a matter of urgency. It needs to be done immediately in order that people can be reassured.

Their jobs will be at risk unless we resolve a dispute between the National Maritime College of Ireland and the Marine Survey Office. In February 2015, the National Maritime College of Ireland made a submission to the Marine Survey Office seeking approval of a refresher course, but it has not yet received such approval. Following the Marine Survey Office's failure to respond, the National Maritime College of Ireland approached the UK Marine and Coastguard Agency through a dedicated maritime offshore joint venture training company. The UK agency is highly regarded globally and has approved courses undertaken in a number of EU member states, including France, Spain, the Netherlands and Croatia. Every member state recognises the appropriate certificates issued by other member states. The seafaring upgrade that was carried out by the UK Marine and Coastguard Agency in conjunction with the National Maritime College of Ireland relates to on-board safety and basic seafaring safety skills. The Minister can resolve the stand-off that has developed as a consequence of all this. He needs to convince the Marine Survey Office of the legitimacy of the refresher courses that were provided by the UK Marine and Coastguard Agency. The agency, which is recognised globally, came here to provide these courses, and 400 seafarers took part in them.Their jobs are now at risk if this is not resolved, as well as the jobs of 20 lecturers. I believe the Marine Survey Office is in contravention of Article 3 of the 2005 directive due it not recognising this. I understand the National Maritime College of Ireland has written to the Minister about this and is awaiting a response. Has the Minister received and read that letter? It can also test this by proceeding through court proceedings if necessary. This could be very embarrassing both nationally and internationally for the Minister's office and the situation pertaining to the recognition of the legitimacy of this course.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	239	I thank the Minister for attending this debate. I ask him to intervene in this situation, not just in terms of the specific issues in dispute but also with regard to the wider issue of the relationship between the Marine Survey Office, the Department and the National Maritime College of Ireland. As the Minister with responsibility for education at the time, I was involved in sanctioning the public private partnership that led to the establishment of the National Maritime College of Ireland for â¬65 million in capital spend, a major infrastructure in maritime education. It is dismaying and deeply depressing that a row of this nature has developed. The level of hostility, although that might be too strong a word, between a national college and a parent Department is unacceptable. My colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, attended a meeting yesterday with some officials from the Marine Survey Office, MSO, and the head of the maritime college. There was a robust exchange of views. It should never have come to this, that there is a major public dispute about accreditation in the maritime field. That, above all else, demands the Minister's intervention, and his commitment and determination to resolve this and to put the relationship between his Department, the agencies under the Department and the maritime college on a better footing for the future. As a former Minister with responsibility for education I cannot comprehend how such a dispute has developed. One does not see this type of intractable row developing with Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, the institutes of technology, universities, the National University of Ireland, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC and further education bodies. In this case, 400 mariners had been certified under a British accreditation agency. The programmes were delivered in a joint venture by the National Maritime College of Ireland and SEFtec Global Training. They offer these courses, a number of refresher training courses, in the maritime college in Ringaskiddy. They are approved by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in the United Kingdom, but not by the Irish equivalent. That is contrary to the mutual recognition of qualifications directive under the European Union. It appears that the MSO is requiring fully qualified master mariners to deliver the courses whereas people who have knowledge of this issue say it is not the place of master mariners to teach these basic courses. In colleges throughout the world the courses are taught by ex-boatswains, ex-petty officers from the navy or other such seamen who are used to launching and recovering life rafts, lifeboats and so forth on a daily basis. Likewise, firefighting courses are normally taught by people who are experienced firefighters. Ship masters are not required. There appears to be a lack of pragmatic engagement here. The upshot is a damaging public dispute, which I regret, as well as potential redundancies, the ending of the joint venture, damage to the reputation of the college and the undermining of its future. I urge the Minister to become involved due to the macro dimension to this, the need to put that relationship on a much better footing than it currently is. He also must have the issue sorted for the 400 people who have done the course.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	240	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for accepting this issue today. I am not surprised we are discussing it. It is good that it is being aired in the House. It should not have come to this but we must air the matter now to ensure we do not have to return to it in the future. The most damning part of the statement from the NMCI is that it applied for accreditation in February 2015 and as of yesterday it still had not received formal approval for the course. Noting the delays in the Marine Survey Office, it was able to go to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, MCA, in the UK, get approval in May or June last year and have a course up and running in August 2015. It has now trained more than 400 personnel and given them a European recognised accreditation, yet the Marine Survey Office refuses to recognise that accreditation. There is something badly wrong if such a situation can develop and the inertia from February 2015 through to today is allowed to continue. I have dealt with fishermen who were obliged to deal with the Marine Survey Office over the years and I am aware that they have great difficulty getting processed and dealt with through that office. I have raised issues on numerous occasions in the House relating to fishermen getting their skipper's tickets recognised for work in the offshore industry and in the workboat industry. In the UK jurisdiction, a person who has a full skipper's ticket can automatically get a workboat licence for a workboat up to 500 tonne weight. One cannot do that here. The Marine Survey Office insists that the person must go on a two-year course in the national college and work up six months sea time in the sector before it might consider giving them the certificate. There is a real problem with the Marine Survey Office responding to the needs of people working in the industry and getting their certification. I hope the Minister will intervene to resolve this issue and that the issue can be resolved. The prospect of 400 seafarers being out of work, the possible closure of the training course and the losses this would cause is too much to lose at this stage. However, it might be welcome if it leads to changes in the Marine Survey Office so that it will do what it is supposed to do and respond by facilitating the training and allowing it to happen, rather than sitting on an application for more than 16 months with nothing being done about it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	241	I thank the Deputies for raising this subject. I will address the immediate issue for those who are unaware of it. There was a meeting yesterday between my officials and representatives of the MSO and the NMCI and it appears they have reached an agreement on a solution to this problem. However, I take the point made by Deputy Martin, which is new to me. If there is a bad relationship between the two organisations concerned and if it is a permanently bad relationship, I will address it with the officials and find out what is happening. Obviously that could have led to this outbreak, although I am not saying it did. One of the features of this row was that an extraordinary amount of political speed and agility was shown. I learned about it last Thursday or Friday night. Deputy Ferris asked me to intervene. I am not prone to intervening directly unless I have to, but I rapidly asked my officials to meet with the MSO people involved. They did that yesterday. It appears at this stage to have been sorted on agreeable terms. The implementation of it is still to be proven, but the action terms appear to be agreed. I will address the wider subject and if there is bad blood between these two organisations, let us address it. In the meantime, the intervention, the fact that they met and that there was not so much megaphone diplomacy meant it could be resolved to the satisfaction, I believe, of all parties involved in a very short time. I will outline some of the background to this dispute and the parties involved. Ireland is a party to the International Convention on the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, STCW. This is the convention which regulates the safety of seafarers on a global basis. Ireland has been subject to evaluation by the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, which has confirmed that Ireland is giving full and complete effect to the provisions of this convention, as a result of which Ireland is placed on the IMO whitelist for the provision of maritime education and training.We also comply fully with all our international obligations relating to mutual recognition of qualification in the maritime sector. My Department, through the MSO, approves and certifies a number of providers within the State for the provision of training in accordance with the convention. This includes the National Maritime College of Ireland, which is the principal provider of seafarer training in Ireland. My Department also approves many other course providers that provide short courses in sea survival, boat handling and firefighting skills. The Deputies will appreciate that the provision of courses in line with an international convention in safety is one which is taken very seriously by my Department. The Deputies have raised an issue which has been the subject of a good deal of communications in recent weeks between SEFtec NMCI Overseas Training, the commercial partners of the National Maritime College of Ireland, among others, and my own Department. My Department has, at all times, endeavoured to engage constructively with what are sometimes sensitive and complex issues. I am also aware that there have been media inquires during the past week to which we have provided responses, so I am happy to have this opportunity this afternoon, as Minister with responsibility for safety regulation in the maritime sector, to clarify a number of important issues on the record and for the benefit of Members of the House who may have concerns or inquiries on behalf of constituents. Let me at this point confirm that my Department, through the MSO, has approved the programmes mentioned by the Deputies in the National Maritime College of Ireland. The NMCI sought approval in 2015 for these programmes, which are mandated by the convention I mentioned earlier. The programmes cover a number of vital safety areas, including sea survival, boat handling and fire fighter skills. Full approval was granted in autumn last year in respect of two of the five categories sought. On the remaining three categories of courses, a final application was received in spring 2016. My Department has given preliminary approval to the NMCI to deliver these courses. Final approval is given when my Department officials attend the first programme and confirm that it is delivered in accordance with the approval. This is a normal practice when certain programmes are being approved.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	242	If a meeting has occurred between the Department and the two organisations, they have buried the hatchet to some extent at least and got things moving along, then that is very good news and a positive outcome. The issue, which has been going on for a considerable length of time between these two organisations, needs to be resolved permanently. I am sure that the Minister and his staff will work to ensure that whatever kind of reconciliation is required will happen quickly and that we will not be in this position again. It is deplorable that two State organisations providing a service as vital as this one should be at loggerheads over something. It is unbelievable that it can come to this stage. I welcome the result that has occurred. I hope we will work out a way to ensure this never happens again.

It is an indictment of the entire system when it takes an intervention by the Minister to resolve it, for which I commend him. People who have the trust of the Government and elected representatives should live up to and honour that trust, not be in the situation where we read headlines in the papers about what is happening, where the livelihoods of 400 plus people were in jeopardy because of ego, or for whatever reason this could not be resolved. From what I have been told about this and what I have read about it, the intervention is timely in so far as this could have ended up in the courts. It would have been highly embarrassing from a European perspective, especially in the EU maritime section. It would have been highly embarrassing for our situation here. I again thank the Minister for intervening and commend him on it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	244	I thank the Minister for his response. I have not used the phrase "bad blood", but I make these assertions in the context of what has unfolded. It seems difficult to comprehend how the situation developed in the manner it has. The Minister was not in a position to give the full reply because of time constraints, but he said that final approval is given when Department officials, "attend the first programme and confirm that it is delivered in accordance with the approval". To date I see that the NMCI has not notified us of the date for the first programme. This is contrary to what we have been told about the courses. The Minister's full reply states that he is conscious of the plight of the 400 mariners, that the reasons are too complex to go into any real detail, but he will do something about it. I trust that anyone who has undertaken the courses will have validation and be sorted, because they undertook them in good faith. I welcome the Minister's intention to get involved in the relationship issue, because there should be a seamless system in place to facilitate accreditation of courses delivered by national colleges. The Minister's reply confirms that this college is a main provider of a range of seafaring programmes under the auspices of the MSO. Therefore, it is imperative that a seamless, constructive, engaged process is delivered in terms of accreditation of programmes. The joint venture is an important enterprise because it is key to the Cork harbour area and to the development of education and research. The National Maritime College is a very important aspect of that. We are a maritime nation.

I am glad to hear that this issue has been resolved. Again, it should not have to be taken to the floor of the House to be resolved and the Minister should not have to intervene in a process to make sure that a resolution is reached. I welcome the fact this has happened because that might change the practices and change how business is done between the Marine Survey Office and the people it is there to service. Sometimes you wonder whose role it is to service who. That might be part of the problem. We also get the suggestion thrown up that this is a safety issue. That is a way to try to shut down any discussion and conversation on how business is carried out. I urge the Minister to make sure we do not get into this kind of situation again in the future. That is the key thing that has to be learnt from this.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	246	I thank the Deputies for their responses. I cannot promise the same result in any other disputes looming on the horizon, but this one seems to be resolved for the moment and I hope permanently. The area covering the seafarers is a big issue. For those who might have been in limbo and those who have already undergone relevant training in SNO, which are obviously parallel or similar programmes to the ones the Deputies referred, I make it clear we are conscious of their position. Without getting into the details, some of which are quite complex, I can confirm that a process is being put in place which will ensure that maritime safety, employment and the validity of the qualifications of seafarers are fully respected and protected. I understand that both parties have undertaken to act very quickly to ensure that the necessary applications, analyses and validation can take place within a matter of weeks, and that no further disruption to course activities need occur, nor should there be any further question mark relating to employment. In passing, I thank not just all the Deputies here who have been involved, but Deputy Michael McGrath for the role he played in bringing everybody to the table.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	247	I am grateful to the Cheann Comhairle for listing this issue among the Topical Issue matters for today. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee for dealing with this. A lot of media and public attention has correctly been focused on the emerging administrative, management oversight, employee, auditing and financial aspects of the Console scandal, but there is, as I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate, another dimension to this story of equal importance, which until today has not gathered much traction. That concerns the clients the charity serves. The focus over the last two weeks has correctly been on the emerging scandalous management of what is known as the national suicide charity, Console.While the mismanagement of Console has been to the forefront and the news has focused on how the organisation was managed essentially as a constant credit supply to its chief executive without proper supervision or auditing, while simultaneously being in receipt of significant State funding, I am sure the Minister of State will agree that there are voices which have not been heard and which have been given little volume since the story first broke. They are the voices of clients who, most disturbingly, seem to be the very last to be considered as talk of a wind-down of Console gains traction. The question of what would happen to the clients of Console arose once last week. They are the individuals who turned to its counselling service for help because they were suicidal or had familial experience of suicide. One answer suggests the services of Console will be transferred to another agency. Several agencies have been mentioned in this context. Neither of the two agencies I have heard mentioned specialises in the services offered by Console in the past ten or 15 years and this point has been made in the media and on social media. As the Minister of State is aware, Console is specialised and provides bereavement counselling services. A profound challenge which is unlikely to be met by those responsible for dealing with the financial and administration issues which have arisen concerns where the clients have been left. The CEO of the HSE moved today to address some of these issues but in a general way. However, I very much welcome his intervention and some of what he said. The HSE has contingency plans in place which involve maintaining the existing services and replacement services. I wish to focus on replacement services.  After the Minister of State responds, I may have further questions to ask.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	248	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As he rightly stated, the revelations relating to Console in recent weeks have, unfortunately, once again sent shockwaves through our very small nation. While we are a small nation, we are very generous and have always given to charitable organisations. Therefore, something like this is very upsetting not only for those who are availing of the service but also for those who work in the organisation. Console is one of the charities funded in part through the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention. The services it provides are counselling therapy and support services for people who have been bereaved by suicide and they have a huge benefit for many individuals. The HSE audit of Console was initiated in April 2015 by the National Office for Suicide Prevention following an examination of the 2013 records from Console to the HSE which were received in late 2014. The HSE has confirmed that concerns arose in a number of areas, including corporate governance and the financial management of the agency. Concerns had been raised in 2009 by the HSE about Console's cashflow, resulting in certain controlled actions being taken at the time by the National Office for Suicide Prevention. In 2014 the HSE put in place a revised governance framework for all organisations funded by it. A question has been raised about the new revised framework which did not work. I have been informed that at the time the HSE was confident the matters that had been raised would be resolved and its aim was to work with the organisation and ensure the services remained. We now know that there was much more to it. The need to maintain public confidence in the charities sector is of the utmost importance, particularly in view of the excellent work carried out in the sector which is of benefit to the most vulnerable people in society. I fully support the involvement of the Charities Regulatory Authority in this matter. As all Deputies are aware, An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na is also involved at this stage. While it is a serious matter that needs to be comprehensively investigated, it is important that the services offered by Console not be affected. The Deputy has rightly said much of the media attention has been on the scandal of the mismanagement of funding, but all the while consideration by the HSE of alternative service options has been under way and worked through in parallel with this process. While I cannot comment on some of the work being undertaken, there are two groups of people whom we need to ensure are looked after properly. We need to ensure we look after the service users, their families and friends in order they will know the service they have been receiving until now has been the correct and proper service. We also need to ensure the counsellors, staff and volunteers who are also victims do not feel abandoned by us and that they know, whether they move to another organisation and whether the services needed are created somewhere else, that they are part of it and not left behind. That has been my priority throughout. It has also been the HSE's priority and needs to continue to be our priority.

The Minister of State has her finger on the pulse and it sounds as though she has had her finger on it since the issue began. She knows and appreciates that the relationship between a counsellor and a client is special and confidential. A number of questions might be going through the minds of clients about alternative or replacement services, particularly for those in a vulnerable position. They may be wondering whether they will see the same counsellor again, if the same counsellor will be available to them in a replacement service and where will they see the counsellor. They may be wondering who will be responsible for their case notes if there is a replacement service, where the case notes are now and whether they are the responsibility of the counsellor or Console. They may also be wondering who will make contact to inform them. If Console has responsibility for the details and case notes, will they, without the knowledge of the client, be passed on to another organisation designated to do the work of Console? While Mr. David Hall and his team are to be commended - they may be attempting to address the financial and administrative issues - it is important to distinguish between the relative ease in the business world with which clients can be transferred from one business to another after a liquidation and the sensitivity surrounding the issue. When the CEO of the HSE speaks about contingency planning and replacement services, it needs to be spelled out a little more. The board of Console will meet this evening and I understand the Minister of State may not be able to spell it out now, but it is a question that must be answered. I note from Console's website that its plans for later in the calendar year are still being advertised. Does the Minister of State agree that it is vital to keep the counsellors and clients of Console fully briefed on ongoing developments? Does she understand the sensitivity of the issues surrounding the replacement of services as opposed to their continuation? Does she agree that should Console be wound down, the services it has offered will still be badly needed? What contingency plan does she or the HSE have in place to meet this possibility? Is she committed to the continued funding of mental health services, specifically for those bereaved by suicide? Will she reassure the clients of Console that their needs will be placed front and centre, as they appear to be, and that this will continue to happen as the scandal reaches its conclusion?
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	250	I assure the Deputy, the staff, counsellors, patients and service users of Console that how this issue has affected and will affect them has been to the forefront. The reason we have not heard many comments on it from me, the Department of Health and the HSE in recent weeks, in the past week in particular, is it is sensitive and we want to ensure they are briefed and happy with what is happening, that whatever process happens next is right and suits their needs and that the service provided will continue. That is the priority.  The Deputy mentioned the provision of information for service users.The HSE and all public staff have responsibilities under data protection legislation. These responsibilities ensure personal data such as medical records are used and shared appropriately and legally, that they are stored securely, that they are not disclosed to unauthorised third parties and that they are disposed of appropriately when no longer required. They will apply to any information on service users, regardless of whether it is transferred to another service. Moving forward and to follow on from our discussion last night, it is welcome that the Minister will now commence section 4 of the Charities Act, that this will give the regulator more power and that more money is being raised to hire more staff to carry out its duties. Now more than ever we need to make sure people have confidence in these organisations in order that, wherever the service users will move to, they will have confidence in that organisation. A lot of confidence has been knocked and, unfortunately, what has happened at Console and one or two other organisations previously has left a bad taste in people's mouths. However, it is not the norm. Therefore, we need to make sure there is a proper regulatory body that can act and make sure something like this will not happen again. I again reassure the Deputy that the service users, counsellors and staff working within Console are and will continue to be at the forefront of everything we are doing.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15925	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	251	I am delighted to be able to raise this matter. Today, at 3 a.m., a serious fire engulfed the Patrician Academy post-primary boys' school in Mallow, County Cork. It caused extensive damage to the administrative block, science labs, technical drawing and woodwork rooms and computer facilities. The building dates from 1886. The school was established by the Patrician Brothers and has since been laicised. The fire caused such extensive damage that adjoining residential premises were evacuated in the early hours of the morning. In the meantime the Garda has confirmed that a technical examination of the site is under way. In raising the matter I recognise that it will take considerable time to move to construction phase and that people are still getting over the shock of what happened last night. The school community still feels very raw about it, but I ask the Minister for Education, Deputy Richard Bruton, once the school community, the principal and the board of management make formal contact with the Department, if emergency accommodation can be provided in advance of the start of the new school year in September. Parents, the principal, the teachers and the community are very anxious not to be left without at least temporary accommodation, particularly for those students who will be facing into State examinations from September onwards. I am, therefore, raising the issue to ask that these resources be made available.  I acknowledge that the Secretary General of the Department spoke to me today about the matter. I recognise that there are quite a number of issues that will have to be gone through, including insurance, investigations, etc., but I am hopeful the Department will prioritise this project. We acknowledge that there has been a considerable degree of capital investment in the school in the recent past, including the provision of an autism unit, as well as additional classrooms. I am hopeful, therefore, that at least in the short term, pending further planning for the rebuilding and future-proofing of the school, emergency accommodation will be provided as soon as possible and that, once the school makes formal contact with the Department, the matter will be expedited.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23131	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	252	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I know that he raised it earlier on the Order of Business and I can only imagine what a devastating blow it is to the community in Mallow. As he said, it concerns a school with a great and outstanding record and it comes as a great blow to it that it suffered such damage in the fire. I thank him for contacting the Department and assure him that we will take the matter extremely seriously. My officials have since spoken to the school principal about the extent of the damage caused and while it is too early to determine the level of structural damage caused, the principal has advised my Department that the school has made contact with its insurance provider and that an assessor is due to visit the school today. A member of my Department's technical service will also visit the school site today. The Deputy will appreciate that the position is fluid, but the outcome of the assessor's site visit is expected to suggest a way forward. I understand the statutory authorities will also conduct a technical investigation. My Department will work very closely with the school and other interests in the community to make sure we make the very best provision possible for the children who have been impacted on. I undertake to track the issue and report back in due course to the Deputy on how the project is evolving, following the receipt of the technical assessments.

#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	255	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I thank everybody for being here to welcome my Bill which is required to bring legal clarity to au pair exchanges. There is no definition of au pair in Irish legislation and the absence of such a definition has created a legal lacuna for host families and au pairs. In March the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, made a ruling on an au pair payment which threatens to undermine the tradition of au pair exchanges. The issue affects 20,000 families who use au pairs and have been criminalised by the ruling. I am not trying to say one group is wrong and another is right. I am trying to find an expression that represents the 20,000 families who have engaged in the tradition of having an au pair. Without action on the issue, the au pair system will be a thing of the past. This would be a tragedy for the families and children who host them and the thousands of young men and women who come to our shores every year and live with an Irish family, learn English, experience our culture and build long-lasting relationships with young people from other countries, as well as Irish families. Groups such as Migrant Rights Centre Ireland aim to do away with the tradition and practice of having au pair. They dislike it because of its informal exchange of mutual benefit rather than being a conventional employee-employer relationship. It is ludicrous to take the position that parents who take in au pairs and provide them with lodging, hospitality and pocket money in exchange for flexible child minding arrangements and doing light housework are in an exploitative relationship. The majority of au pair-host relationships in Ireland and almost all other countries in western Europe, including those with the highest quality and most accessible child care services in the world such as Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, are not exploitative, but this is not to say there has not been exploitation. I totally acknowledge that there has, which is why legislation is required. The claim that the status quo arrangements are working and should not be touched is untenable. Since March the 20,000 families who use au pairs have been terrified that they are breaking the law, which is why I have brought forward the Bill. I have received telephone calls, as have Deputies around the Chamber, since March. People are asking us, as legislators, to assist and support them. The case-by-case adjudication made by the courts or the WRC is not good for au pairs. The Bill will provide far superior protection for au pairs and host families than they enjoy. More than 50 cases are awaiting adjudication by the WRC. Many of these so-called au pairs were working up to 50 hours per week, often for two to four years, but that is not what the Bill is about. For the first time, it will make clear what is not an au pair exchange. It defines an au pair exchange as a cultural, educational exchange programme involving light child care and domestic chores in return for the host family providing lodging, hospitality and pocket money. The Bill will provide far greater protection for au pairs. By defining clearly what is and is not an au pair exchange, the Bill will also provide far greater protection for domestic workers who are wrongly taken in under the guise of an au pair position. More often than not, in exploitation situations, the workers are taken on directly via an au pair website rather than through an intermediary such as an au pair agency. If a young person who enters into an arrangement as an au pair with a host family believes he or she is being overworked or treated unfairly, the only recourse is through the courts or the WRC.The new arrangement proposed in the legislation provides much greater protection for au pairs with a much more easily accessible dispute resolution mechanism prior to going to the courts or the WRC. New protections for au pairs are provided in the following manner: first, the Bill will outlaw the current practice of au pairs and host families finding each other directly via au pair exchange websites. In this scenario, a host and an au pair either enter directly into a relationship without an intermediary au pair agency, which would usually interview the potential au pair as well as the host family and identify the suitability between both. Under our legislation, for an au pair placement to be considered as such by law, au pairs and host families will have to go through an accredited agency or an intermediary. Second, the Bill provides for a written agreement between the host family and the au pair prior to entering any arrangement. These agreements will be standardised according to regulations set down by the Minister in conjunction with the sector. The written agreement will ensure both families and the au pairs enter into an arrangement with both eyes open. The agreements will set down in detail what the light child care domestic chores will involve, how many hours per day or per week and, importantly, by definition, if au pairs work in excess of these hours, they will no longer be classed as au pairs but as domestic workers. In return, the agreement will specify the lodgings that will be provided to au pairs, their access to meals and other hospitality, as well as the pocket money they will be furnished with. While the idea of providing pocket money rather than a wage has been criticised, such criticism is misguided. It is usually more beneficial to both au pairs and to the host families for this to be considered as an informal exchange where the young person lives with the family rather than as a conventional employee-employer relationship that does not involve lodging. Some 20,000 au pairs travel to work in Ireland each year. However, if families had to register as employees and pay the current minimum wage as well as employer's PRSI while complying with employer regulations associated with the formal employer-employee relationship, the number of families taking traditional live-in au pairs would reduce significantly. We estimate the number would reduce by between 80% and 90%. The WRC ruling does not properly take into account the value of accommodation and hospitality for au pairs. I bring my personal experience to bear in this debate. I am a mum working full time and I need the support of an au pair. My children go to school and come home at 3 p.m. but I still have to hold clinics in the evening and, therefore, I need assistance between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. That equates to six hours a day, five days a week, giving a total of 30 hours. That is the support working families are looking for. I do not see myself as a criminal but that is what I will be classified as and, therefore, I ask Members to support the Bill.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	256	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I compliment my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, on bringing the legislation forward. As a party, Fianna FÃ¡il is responding to the legal lacuna highlighted in March this year when the WRC made a ruling that threatens to undermine the tradition of au pairing, which dates back in excess of 40 years, and threatens to criminalise tens of thousands of families. The ruling highlighted the need to bring clarity to the status of au pairs in Ireland by providing a regulatory framework to protect young persons and ensure they maximise the educational experience that can be derived from this cultural exchange. The Bill provides a legal framework to prevent the exploitation of au pairs through regulation. The WRC's determination was made in the absence of any legislation or regulation and it is up to the commission to determine the relationship between au pairs and host families. It is up to us who have been honoured to be elected to this body to legislation and to introduce regulatory frameworks. As a party, we are proposing a reasonable, proportionate system of regulation, which will protect au pairs and the tens of thousands of families, which Deputy Rabbitte has rightly identified as relying on the services of au pairs, but, most important, it will protect the children of the families who are cared for by au pairs. As legislators, we have a duty to do this. "Prime Time" broadcast an exposÃ© earlier this year, which showed a minority of families who exploit these young people. The legislation outlines a set of minimum standards which must be complied with; we have none currently. Families must go through an accredited agency. One of the minimum standards is a stipulation requiring a written agreement which will identify what light child care and domestic chores involve, up to a maximum of 30 hours a week in return for lodgings, hospitality and pocket money. The Bill seeks to establish an au pair council, the primary responsibility of which is the protection and vindication of the rights of au pairs. If disputes arise, there will be an agency to deal with them and if they are not happy with the agency, the au pair council can deal with them. We are setting out a clear regulatory framework to deal with this sector going forward because it has not been dealt over the past 40 years. I am annoyed by critics both inside and outside the House. They have done nothing since March and they are happy to let young people continue to be exploited and to leave tens of thousands of families be treated like criminals. It has been stated au pairing is a substitute for cheap child care. I am one of the greatest advocates of quality, affordable child care. This legislation is not about cheap child care and, by definition, it will not be considered as another form of child care. The Bill will eliminate the black market or unregulated sector. One of the greatest flaws in the argument put forward by one of the opponents to this legislation is the attempt to equate these workers with domestic workers. There is a difference between domestic workers and au pairs. Au pairs are not domestic workers. Every other European country does not consider au pairs to be domestic workers. Au pairs travel to Ireland voluntarily to learn a language and experience Irish culture on an exchange programme. Most are from other western European countries, which also have such programmes. If they wanted to travel to be employed as domestic workers earning the minimum wage, they could do that. I am party spokesperson on tourism and I have met representatives of the Irish Hotels Federation and people working in the tourism sector who are crying out for domestic workers. People who come to work as au pairs do so out of choice. There is a clear difference between them and domestic workers. The 1969 Council of Europe agreement on au pairs states that persons placed as au pairs belong neither to the student category or the work category but to a special category which has features of both and, therefore, it is useful to make appropriate arrangements for same. We are 47 years further on as a country but we have not done so. We, as a party, have brought forward legislation to deal with that and it is a genuine attempt at a fair, reasonable and proportionate response to the current situation. It behoves all Members to at least support the Second Stage reading and allow the Bill to pass through to Committee Stage. If amendments and improvements can be made, we will be open to that.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	257	I very much welcome this Bill which is very much needed in order to bring legal clarity to the au pair exchange programme in Ireland. We have been in limbo since the WRC ruling in March of this year, which states that the host-au pair relationship is the same as that of an employer and employee and which does not accurately reflect the reality of the au pair exchange programme or the intention of both the au pair and the host family. The reality is that this is a unique relationship that Ireland has participated in for many years and while the host family gets assistance with child care and housework, the au pair is very much part of the family and gets food and lodgings and an opportunity to learn or improve their English. It is a cultural exchange where both sides to that exchange benefit enormously. Deputy Rabbitte spoke passionately about the assistance the arrangement gives families, in particular families living in rural communities who do not have the same level of access to and choice of child care facilities. The fact that there is no definition of an au pair in Irish law is clearly not adequate and we as legislators have a responsibility to address this legislative deficiency on our Statute Book. This Bill addresses this in a clear, decisive and helpful way. It is important to note, as has already been mentioned, that there are approximately 20,000 families with au pairs in Ireland and I expect they will all very much welcome the clarity this Bill provides for their situation.  I note and take account of the concerns raised by different stakeholders and groups in and around discussing this Bill. Issues of au pair exploitation have arisen due to a lack of definition of what an au pair is, a lack of regulation around the au pair exchange programme and the lack a proper legal framework within which people can operate in this country. There is no doubt that abuse of people participating in au pair programme has occurred in the past , and I do not and never will condone this behaviour and neither does the Fianna FÃ¡il Party. Au pairs deserve to be well looked after by host families and treated with dignity and respect. It is a great privilege to welcome someone elseâs child into one's home and with that comes a great responsibility. I think most families treat their au pairs as they would want their own child treated if they went abroad on a similar exchange programme. It is important to note that those bad experiences and instances of abuse and neglect are the exception and not the norm and most families provide excellent care and hospitality to their au pairs.  The Bill seeks to crack down on less regulated elements of the au pair sector by requiring that both the au pair and host family sign a written agreement through an accredited au pair agency. The Bill also provides for setting up mechanisms for hearing complaints and resolving disputes on behalf of au pairs and host families. Those are all very welcome improvements to the current situation and go towards addressing the concerns raised. If the au pair programme is to survive as an opportunity for both au pairs and host families in this country, the focus needs to remain on English language development, the cultural exchange and the inclusion in family life which the exchange offers, which is key to the programme. Employment law does nothing to protect or promote those values I mentioned.  If one makes someone an employee, it completely changes the relationship that an au pair has with their host family and we would be naive to think otherwise. We want host families to feel comfortable having someone in their home, interacting with their children and being part of the family. If an au pair is an employee and no longer a student or a young person participating on an exchange programme, there is no doubt that host families will feel nervous about this new arrangement and relationship and they will likely constantly worry about their legal position as unintended employers. Changing the relationship in this way will reduce the number of au pairs coming to Ireland and the number of families willing to take au pairs into their family home. That is something I do not want to see happen, nor, I am sure, do the majority of people in this country.  I am mindful of examples of some families that I have spoken to about this issue in my constituency of Mayo. One family in particular that would be friends of mine have had au pairs come into their home for a number of years and it has been a family arrangement. Those au pairs have been very much part of the family, have participated in family outings and events, have eaten meals at the family table and the family's children have seen them as part of the family. That is the relationship that we want to maintain. Some of those au pairs have come back to visit the family in question and the family has also travelled to the home country of au pairs to visit their families. It is that relationship we want to build upon, but if we change it into an employer-employee relationship, it damages all of that. It changes the relationship into something quite different and does not respect the unique relationship that exists under the arrangement. It does not go towards meeting the intention of the au pair and what they are seeking from that relationship and nor does it go towards meeting the intention of the host family.  In light of this I very much welcome the Bill and I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House in support of it, alongside my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, our spokesperson on children and youth affairs, who put forward this legislation.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	258	I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this important issue in her Private Members' Bill but the Government is opposing it for the reasons I will detail. I would ask Members across the floor of the Chamber to listen attentively to what I have to say. I acknowledge that the issue of child care presents a very real difficulty on a daily basis for thousands of families across the country. However, to attempt to address this issue by dependence on unqualified and poorly remunerated overseas labour working for board, lodging and pocket money is not the way forward. Do the Members opposite truly believe that one human being should work 30 hours per week, or seven hours per day, for another in return for board, lodging and pocket money? That is why we cannot support this. Taking away rights from such vulnerable workers will not provide the solution to the need for affordable, quality child care. The approach set out in the Bill runs counter to the Governmentâs approach to the affordability of quality child care which my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, will deal with in detail later in the debate. The Bill provides that a person of any age who participates on an au pair exchange with an agency can provide childminding, domestic chores and other household duties for 30 hours per week or seven hours per day in return for hospitality lodging and pocket money. The absence of an upper age limit in the Billâs definition of au pair is notable as well, especially in view of the fact that the Long Title refers to the better protection of rights of young people. The Bill envisages people of all ages working for board, lodging and pocket money. The Members opposite do not see the need for some minimum level of pocket money. It could be as low as one euro. What does â7 hours a dayâ mean? Is it 35 hours per week? Is it 49 hours per week? How many hours per week do they expect people to work, in return for board, lodging and pocket money? Again I reiterate that the Government fully understands the financial and other pressures faced by many working families as regards child care. I will give a few examples. Do the Members opposite realise that under our existing laws - we should look at those - a worker under 18 years of age, who lives in with meals provided, under the terms of the National Minimum Wage Act could work 31.8 hours per week for â¬150, when account is taken of the monetary amount that can be included as reckonable pay when board and lodgings are provided. A person over 18 years of age, and in the first year of employment, could work 27.9 hours per week on the same basis. A person over 18 years of age, and in the second year of employment, could work 24.8 hours per week, while a person over 18 years of age who has worked for more than two years could work 22.3 hours per week provided board and lodgings are provided. Those examples show how child care can be delivered within the terms of the National Minimum Wage Act. Of course, this will never match 30 hours per week, seven hours per day for board, lodging and pocket money. The National Minimum Wage Act permits an employer to include a monetary allowance as reckonable pay if they provide an employee with full board and lodgings, which is usually the case with au pairs. The current amount for board and lodgings, namely, â¬54.13 per week or â¬7.73 per day, is set out in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. I am conscious of the passage of time since these rates were set and it is timely perhaps that they would be reviewed with respect to board and lodgings. To this end, it is my intention as Minister of State to ask the Low Pay Commission to review the allowances for board and lodgings, provided for under the National Minimum Wage Act, as part of its next work programme. That is something we can seriously consider and that might be a way to solve the problem. The Bill does not explicitly provide for an exclusion from the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, nor from the range of other employment rights legislation such as the Organisation of Working Time Act.This effectively means that host families securing child care through the elaborate structures proposed in the Bill would remain open to challenges by persons working as au pairs that they are in fact employees and those families would remain exposed to potentially significant awards being made against them. It would be giving families a false sense of security while leaving them very exposed. This brings me to an important point which needs to be emphasised in this debate and which should underpin our consideration of the Bill. National policy on employment law has consistently been to avoid the creation of sub-categories of vulnerable workers with low or no employment rights and with no access to the protections the status of employee provides. In this regard, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that during our Presidency of the EU in 2013, Ireland was to the forefront in opening the way for EU member states to ratify the ILO's domestic workers convention. We announced out intention during the Presidency and I am pleased to say that the Government ratified the convention in July 2014. The Bill represents a reversal in that policy and would cause significant reputational damage for Ireland. One of the key strengths of our employment rights policy is that we do not discriminate between different categories of worker. While the Bill is completely silent on employment law, it is clearly intended to remove au pairs as defined in the Bill from the protections of employment law. So far, I have centred my reasons for opposing the Bill on national employment law, but any consideration of the issue of au pairs must have regard to the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The court has considered the status of au pairs on a number of occasions and has consistently held that they are workers. The case most often cited in this regard is the Lawrie-Blum case. More recently, the Payir case reaffirmed this view. It is worth quoting from those cases. In the Lawrie-Blum case, the court said, "The term 'worker' covers any person performing for remuneration work the nature of which is not determined by him for and under the control of another, regardless of the legal nature of the employment relationship." In the Payir case, the Advocate Generalâs opinion stated that an au pair who looks after the host family's children and does housework for 25 to 30 hours a week will as a rule have the status of worker. We need to note the view of the Court of Justice of the European Union. It is also worth mentioning two further cases which addressed issues about remuneration. The Watson and Bellman case related to an au pair employed as a family help who looked after children in return for board and lodging. The Advocate General stated in that case, "As this would in fact be work performed for a consideration (board and lodging), she could be classed as coming within a master and servant relationship or if this were not the case she would at least come under the alternative heading of provision of services". In the Steymann case, the court accepted that remuneration can be in forms other than money, including, for example, services provided by the employer to the employee. The Bill takes no account of the position under European law as set down in the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. I ask Deputy Rabbitte to consider that when she makes her submission. In my contribution to this debate on what is an important topic, I have set out why the Government is strongly of the view that the Au Pair Placement Bill 2016 should be opposed. The heart of this stance does not rest on complex legal arguments with reference to national or EU law, although these can be made and I have referred to them here this afternoon. Instead, the Government's opposition to the Bill is based on the principle that vulnerable workers, such as those working as au pairs, need to be protected. The Government is acutely aware of the pressures facing families as regards child care. My colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, will set out the Government's position in this regard. However, it is wrong to try to address this issue by taking away rights from vulnerable workers. For that reason, the Government opposes the Bill.

Ireland may be unique in Europe in its absolute failure to provide any semblance of a national child care policy or services. The situation continues to persist in spite of the fact that since the early 1990s, we have seen increased participation by women in the labour market. Shifts in the global economy have meant that for the first time in its history, Ireland is a receiver of immigrants from countries from within and from outside the EU. This poses huge challenges in terms of the regulation of the labour market and raises real concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable workers in the hidden labour market, especially those workers who are undocumented. In the domestic and au pair sector, the workers are almost always women. The failure to regulate has led to a domestic work sector that is now dominated by informal and irregular work carried out by both au pairs and undocumented migrants. These are two vulnerable groups who experience barriers accessing their rights and frequently remain in exploitative situations in private homes. The disconnect between labour migration policy and employment demand has created an unregulated and exploitative system. The International Labour Organisation's domestic workers convention, ratified by Ireland in 2014 as the Minister said, defines a domestic worker as a person engaged in domestic work within an employment relationship. This definition includes au pairs. Irish employment legislation applies to all workers where an employment relationship exists regardless of the job title given to the worker. Furthermore, all workers come within the remit of the Workplace Relations Commission. Sinn FÃ©in favours the regulation of the au pair sector but we do not feel the Au Pair Placement Bill 2016 achieves this. The Bill will undermine domestic workers' rights and create a flawed and unnecessary hierarchy of rights within the sector. The proposed definition of "au pair" within the Bill is vague and lacks clarity. The Bill fails to provide a clear definition of "light housework" or "light domestic duties". This is a key weakness that has been exposed in other jurisdictions that have au pair schemes. The focus of the Bill is too narrow as it proposes no more than a 30 hour working week. The Bill will also require resources in order to establish and run an au pair accreditation council to be tasked with the protection of the rights of au pairs. However, a body already exists in the Workplace Relations Commission and this proposal undermines its work. It is clear that the sector needs to be regulated, but Fianna FÃ¡il's Bill to categorise au pairs as cultural exchange participants will result in a domestic worker scheme which creates an underclass of migrant domestic workers who have been put out of reach of labour law protections. This is not acceptable as migrant women are more at risk of poverty and suffer in relation to the gender pay gap. Addressing the exploitation of au pairs requires the enforcement of existing laws, resourcing the WRC and informing the public of their responsibilities as employers.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	261	While the Bill acknowledges the need for the regulation of this sector, Sinn FÃ©in cannot support it as it does not go far enough. It is not sufficient in its current form and in its recommendations as my colleagues have and will continue to outline in their contributions. As party spokesperson on child care, I will focus briefly on the elephant in the room, which is the cost of child care. The lack of affordable, accessible and quality child care remains one of the biggest crises across the State. Parents, workers, child care services and children continue to suffer as a result. Child care should be regarded as a public service for both children and parents and, as such, we should address the issues in the sector with the same consideration we give to other levels of education. The major factor in and root cause of the huge increase in the use of au pairs is the cost of child care. Ireland's child care costs are considered the most expensive in the EU and are second to only to the USA worldwide. The cost ranges from â¬800 to â¬1,000 euro per month dependant on location. OECD figures show that the fees paid by a low-income, dual-earner family in Ireland with two young children consume at least 35% of the family's net income. For a lone parent family on the average wage, the fees amount to 40% of income in contrast to just 10% to 13 % across the EU. The jump in the number of families employing au pairs should come, therefore, as little surprise.There has always been a history of au pairs, traditionally European, coming to Ireland and working with families, but the increase of recent years is down to the lack of affordable, accessible and quality child care for many families. Many parents look towards the au pair sector to fill this gap. The Bill provides no detail of what "light housework" and "light domestic duties" entail. The prospect of having an au pair mind one's child or children in one's own home for as little as â¬120 per week with the added bonus of house cleaning and whatever else a family requires is an enticing option for many parents who are struggling to balance the cost of child care with what they earn. Responsibility for the protection of these workers lies with the Government. There is also an onus on au pair recruitment agencies to be aware of and comply with the Employment Agency Act 1971. Trends indicate a growing number of migrant women working in unregulated child care, in other words, an informal workforce providing care in private homes. The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, has identified an increase in the pattern of exploitation experienced by au pairs. We support the MRCI's call for an immediate and co-ordinated response by the Government and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, to ensure that the employment rights of au pair workers are upheld and enforced, with particular emphasis on recruitment agencies and direct employers. We will not support the Bill, as it does not go far enough and is not sufficient in its current form.

I commend them on at least allowing us the opportunity to debate this matter. It is always helpful when people introduce Bills and solutions. If we believed that there was any chance that the Bill could be improved, we would have allowed it to move on to Committee Stage. Previously, we supported Opposition and Government Bills, including some moved by Fianna FÃ¡il, when we believed them worthy of our support or capable of being improved. However, we must also be honest on this occasion. In this instance, the Bill is so fundamentally flawed and regressive that we are not in a position to support it. Au pairs have fought a battle to be seen as workers. Recent WRC decisions have confirmed that they are workers and entitled to the full protection of the law. In introducing a Bill on if-and-when contracts last week, we showed that workers' rights needed to be improved. We must approach the question of au pairing not just from the point of view of children or those who employ au pairs, but of the au pairs themselves. The attempt in the Bill to reframe au pairing as something other than work indicates that employment rights are not at its centre. Interestingly, it was a Fine Gael Minister of State who first mentioned employment rights in this debate, which shows that politics has well and truly been turned on its head. The Bill replaces the minimum wage, which is a statutory rate, with the phrase "pocket money", which is not given any legal definition in the Bill. Nor does one exist in any current legislation. What constitutes "pocket money"? Is it â¬10, â¬20, â¬50 or â¬100 per week? The Bill would establish an independent public authority for accreditation of au pair agencies, but no details are given as to how that would work and no powers are transferred to the authority. All of this is to be worked out by the Minister in question, with the main sanction placed not on the family exploiting the au pair if such a case arises, but on the agency that allocated the au pair to the family in the first instance. This means that a family could break its contract with an au pair in terms of pocket money and not receive any sanction whatsoever. Currently, the family is at least responsible for payment of the minimum wage, whereas the Bill's legal come-back is on the agency, which may receive a written warning from a board that has yet to be established. I wish to be constructive, but Deputy Troy stated that some people who were critical of the Bill had done nothing. Was he referring to the MRCI, which has rightly articulated its concerns, other organisations, the Government, the Opposition or the trade union movement, which has offered reasonable objections to a broad Bill? I want him to correct the record of the House. I hope that he is not referring to the MRCI, which has lobbied all of us and has strong views on this issue. I am the Sinn FÃ©in spokesperson on workers' rights and if I believed that the Bill could be improved on Committee Stage, I would support it. We gave this issue due consideration, but we are not in a position to support the Bill because it is flawed and regressive. That said, I acknowledge that its authors are well intentioned in wanting to address this issue. Perhaps the relevant committee can re-examine the matter, find different solutions and propose a Bill or other measure that receives the support of the House.

We must recognise that au pairs provide a service, are workers and must consequently enjoy minimum working conditions, which we would all expect for ourselves were we migrant workers.

This is a child care issue. Deputy Funchion outlined how the exorbitant cost of child care is a major burden on families. However, it is also a workers' rights issue. We must ensure that the rights of these workers are protected and that this or any legislation introduced with the same intention does not allow other domestic workers to be undercut or any category of workers to have protections lesser than currently exist in the Industrial Relations Act 1990.

The MRCI, which has done a great deal of work in this area and lobbied us all. It states, "The proposed bill undermines the mandate and the expertise of the WRC, suggesting instead that resources be sunk into the establishment and running of an Au Pair Accreditation Council â a wholly unjustifiable cost to the taxpayer". It goes on to say that the introduction of such an au pair system would seriously undermine our legal commitments under the ILO Convention 189 Decent Work for Domestic Workers. The MRCI does important and valuable work. Through that work and the MRCI's campaigns, it should be clear to us all that there is considerable exploitation of migrant workers in Ireland. There are numerous examples, with the case of Muhammad Younis coming to mind immediately. A body of research shows that exploitation of migrant workers is not isolated to a few incidents. This sector requires concise legislation that addresses all aspects and issues holistically rather than through a bit-part approach. TÃ¡ gÃ¡ le reachtaÃ­ocht leis an staid reatha, tar Ã©is an cÃ¡s cÃºirte nÃ­os luaithe sa bhliain, a cheartÃº, ach nÃ­ hÃ­ seo an reachtaÃ­ocht. As has been pointed out by my colleagues, there appears to be a closed-minded view that au pairs come to Ireland to further their grasp of English as well as gain cultural experience. There is little acknowledgement of the work carried out by au pairs and the way in which that work contributes to families. Work is work and must be treated and paid as such. Remuneration at below the minimum wage is not something that we should encourage by any means. The current situation allows opportunities for those housing au pairs to avail of a cheap childminding service. We cannot allow the interests of families and agencies to trump that of the workers. Aside from au pairs, there is a great deal of unregulated childminding, some of which is relatively benign, but some of which involves exploitation and childminders being paid less than the minimum wage. This affects migrant and non-migrant workers and is an issue to which the House should revert.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15925	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	265	I thank the Ceann Comhairle. If the unaligned Deputies present themselves, I will be happy to share time with them. I have no hesitation in agreeing that au pair hosting is a valuable tradition. It can benefit both host families and young foreign visitors who are helped in a domestic environment to improve language skills and enjoy a positive cultural experience. None of us wants to undermine the viability of genuine au pair arrangements, but we must recognise there are two sides to this story. Not all experiences are mutually beneficial. We must also recognise that this Bill, no matter how it is presented, is aimed at removing statutory protections that are currently enjoyed. Until now, au pairs have not been treated as a separate category of worker in our employment law. If there is an agreement to do work, regardless of what title one gives the worker, he or she is entitled to the benefit of our employment protection laws, including on the national minimum wage. A realistic debate on this issue has to take into account the facts on the ground. It seems clear that in many cases au pairs are being used as underpaid domestic workers because of our crisis in child care provision. For example, last yearâs survey by Migrant Rights Centre Ireland showed an age profile for au pairs that does not match the popular perception. It showed that 37% had no contract at all and 40% a verbal contract only. Some 20% had paid a fee to get the job, 38% were expected to work more than originally agreed, 31% had been asked to work when they were sick, 58% were paid â¬120 or less per week, one in ten did not have her own bedroom, and one in five was expected to be on call at night. A balance is needed here. On the one hand, au pair relationships are unique and deserve to be fostered. I agree that the allowance for providing board and lodging, which can be deducted from the minimum wage but which was last properly examined in 2000, needs to be reviewed urgently. On the other hand, I do not believe the best way to regularise activity in the sector is simply to exempt individuals who are legally employed on an employerâemployee basis from our entire suite of employment rights legislation. One should remember that, traditionally understood, au pairs are here primarily to improve their English. They stay here as language students and the domestic setting is an adjunct to the time spent in a language school or college. It is important to bear this in mind when considering how much time an au pair should be required to devote to what this Bill describes as "light domestic duties". Section 2(1)(b) of the legislation states a criterion for placement is that one âbe a non-citizen of the EU ordinarily resident in the Republic of Ireland with a student entry visa as prescribed by Ministerial Order under the Immigration Act 2004." Our immigration laws restrict part-time students to working no more than 20 hours per week. I see no reason we should expect au pairs to work longer than other students for less pay in an entirely unprotected statutory environment and to the detriment of the studies that bring them here in the first place. The objectives of the Bill are inadequate. For example, it proposes an au pair accreditation council to perform important statutory functions but it does not make any provision in respect of the membership of the council, who gets to appoint the members and to whom they are accountable. The Bill does not explicitly state au pairs are exempt from minimum wage legislation, which I presume is its central purpose and the reason for the reference to âpocket moneyâ. There are so many questions raised but left unanswered by this Bill that my party and I cannot support it. It seems to us to be designed more to meet the demands of those in the au pair sector who want light alternative regulation rather than registering as employment agencies than it is designed to meet the needs of families or au pairs themselves. Perhaps the Deputy who is proposing the Bill might respond to that. I do not make that point as a charge. We are all inherently in favour of what the sector delivers for families and the au pairs themselves in terms of the experience they gain. However, we want to ensure we have the right motives when presenting legislation of this nature. It may be that wholesale amendment could improve the Bill but we would not in any circumstances support a legislative regime brought in simply to ensure foreign au pairs could be used in an unprotected way as a resource to meet a need that is not being met within the domestic labour market.

I ask those who introduced the Bill to consider withdrawing it because it has some serious defects. I welcome the au pairs in the Visitors Gallery. Can we stop using the term âau pairâ? We are talking about child care workers. I welcome also the members of Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, who have made many submissions on this Bill and who are completely opposed to it. It is mystifying and very strange that one of the first Bills Fianna FÃ¡il introduces in this Parliament is on such a subject. The Bill is very patronising, regressive and sexist. It refers to 30 hours of light domestic âhelpâ, not labour. Obviously, when women do work, it is not actually labour; it is help. The Bill treats so-called au pairs as non-workers and refers to "pocket money" for 30 hoursâ work. I seriously ask the sponsors of the Bill to consider withdrawing it before they do any more damage. Camouflaging exploitation in a cultural exchange has no justification. The Bill peddles a very dangerous myth, namely, that au pairs - child care workers - are students in a gap year having a bit of craic and fun while staying with a host family and learning a language. That is not the reality. The reality is that the individuals are child care workers who are generally older women. They are mothers themselves, for Godâs sake. They have children themselves to support. It is not pocket money that they are doing the work for. They are trying to send money home in many cases. They are women, workers and mothers, and this is borne out by the statistics. Most of those concerned are aged between 30 and 35. Let us please stop peddling these very dangerous myths and undermining workersâ rights. There is a perception that people are learning a language and engaging in a cultural exchange. It is not the first time I have heard this. There was an article on this subject in The Irish Times by John McManus on 9 March 2016. I do not know whether anyone present read it but they should do so. It refers to an au pair from Italy who was dizzy and baked cakes all the time. It is stated the family had to repair damage to the table, costing "a multiple of what we were paying her". This says it all about the patronising attitude of these wealthy people to employing other people. They were giving out that the au pair was talking to her boyfriend on Skype in her bedroom. What she does in her bedroom is her own business. It is as if one owns the au pair lock, stock and barrel. Let us end this abuse of people. The individuals are not live-in slaves. People should have rights. These rights should be set down and people should be respected for what they do. In a recent case in March, a Spanish au pair, so-called, won an award of almost â¬10,000 and was supported by Migrant Rights Centre Ireland. It was established that such individuals are women workers who are entitled to be treated like workers and to be paid at least the minimum wage. However, that is not what occurs.Before coming to the Chamber, I spoke to an au pair who works 35 hours per week for â¬110, which equates to â¬2.50 per hour, and must pay for food at weekends because the family does not provide any. It is not always the case, therefore, that au pairs receive bed and board. I live in a constituency with a large number of young families and probably the youngest population in the country. Child care is a major issue for my constituents and if the Fianna FÃ¡il Party had proposed a Bill on child care, I would have said "fair play" and sought to amend it, where necessary. Instead, the party introduced legislation that will not do anything for child care workers and will only benefit people who want to exploit them. The Bill sets out a list of duties for au pairs. I do not know if au pairs would have any energy after completing 30 hours of domestic work, chores and childminding. People seem to believe childminding is easy but those who mind children know that is not the case. We must stop treating everything women do as second class. The prescribed duties amount to labour and, as such, au pairs are entitled to be treated the same way as any other worker is treated. They should also earn a hell of a lot more than the minimum wage.  Unfortunately, international experience has shown accreditation is mainly bogus. Despite this, I am willing to engage in a discussion on accreditation. Our amendment calls on the Fianna FÃ¡il Party not to proceed with the Bill at this point because it could jeopardise a number of cases due to come before the Workplace Relations Commission.

It was an exciting time for young women, and as a young woman I had a good experience as an au pair in Germany where I worked with a wonderful family. I acknowledge the legitimate concerns some people have about possible changes which they fear may end the au pair experience for families and students who had a good experience of au pairing in the past. There is, however, a much different experience involved in what is known as au pairing and staying with a host family. The purpose of the amendment is to change the reality of this experience. If the Bill is passed, the first consequence, intended or otherwise, would be to legitimise some of the worst examples of gross exploitation of workers, primarily migrant women who often lack the language skills to defend themselves. Many au pairs work for as little as â¬100 per week and, as Deputy Coppinger pointed out, when we use the word "work", we mean real work. The type of work done by women in the home is both physical and mental. Caring for young children, preparing food and cleaning a home are not light domestic duties but hard bloody work. The role of an au pair does not involve making the odd cup of coffee or preparing a meal here or there. It is demanding work which must be respected and treated as such. The Migrant Rights Centre carried out an important and thorough study which revealed some startling facts. It found that 98% of respondents were women aged between 31 and 35 years. I was a good deal younger than that when I visited Germany as an au pair. The level of au pairing being done by women of this age indicates that au pairing is not, as many people believe, about young people having a bit of craic and learning a language. I fundamentally agree with the view that the Bill would legitimise the abuse of workers by removing their right to access the Workplace Relations Commission, notwithstanding the weaknesses of that body. It would end the protection afforded to these workers under the law and remove protection against bullying. For this reason, we strongly oppose the legislation. Au pairs have a right to access the labour laws of the countries in which they reside. The Bill, if passed, would be a retrograde step. It is interesting to note that Fianna FÃ¡il proposed the Bill. We have received letters from teachers and other workers who point out that they rely on au pairs to provide child care. They are concerned that child care may become much more expensive. It is clear that what is needed is a proper system of affordable, subsidised child care that will meet the needs of women workers. Fianna FÃ¡il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have failed to provide such a system.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	269	This is probably the first time virtually all Deputies have opposed a Bill. The Migrant Rights Centre and the Mandate trade union, both of which have many dealings with migrant workers, oppose the Bill because it fundamentally weakens the rights and protections afforded to workers. Domestic workers are housekeepers, childminders, nannies and au pairs, all of whom are covered by employment law, including in respect of the minimum wage. All domestic workers, including au pairs, come under the remit of the Workplace Relations Commission. In recent years, Ireland strengthened the rights of domestic workers, from ratifying the International Labour Organization's domestic workers convention to introducing protection for workers in diplomats' households and commencing labour inspections of private homes. These and other advances have made Ireland a relatively safe country for domestic workers, although there is always room for improvement in this regard. A survey carried out by the Migrant Rights Centre in 2015, which involved 550 au pairs, found that 98% of respondents were aged between 31 and 35 years, 80% did not have a written contract and 58% were paid less than â¬120 per week. The idea that au pairs are young people taking part in a cultural exchange aimed at improving their English does not correspond to the reality of exploitation experienced by workers in this area. This Bill is staggering. It defines au pair placement as a cultural, learning and educational exchange that would include not more than 30 hours per week or seven hours per day spent doing light domestic duties in exchange for hospitality, lodgings and pocket money. The Fianna FÃ¡il Party must define the terms "light domestic duties" and "pocket money". What we need is not the Bill before us but the enforcement of existing law and an insistence that the agencies involved in au pairing make families and employers aware of their obligations under employment law. The Government must also provide the Workplace Relations Commission with the resources it needs to carry out inspections.

My experience of it over many years was mainly positive as it involved people from other countries, primarily young girls, coming here to learn English while enjoying the benefits of living safely as part of an Irish family where they were included in all family events and holidays. The work involved was certainly not onerous and au pairs were not used as full-time housekeepers or child care workers. In many cases, the relationship between the au pair and the host family continued for years after the au pair's stay ended. In some cases, agencies were used, while in others the arrangements were made privately, with perhaps a friend of the au pair taking her place. This system had learning English at its core. Au pairs did not come here to earn money as such and this was evident in the type of light work they did. My experience of the au pair system, which is based on what I have been told by people I know who used it, is that au pairs were treated as members of the family, were given their own room in the home and had time to attend classes. They had free time and the arrangement was generally voluntary and private. Unfortunately, the system has changed.  Deputies are familiar with the ruling by the Workplace Relations Commission in the case of a Spanish au pair, which provided that au pairs should be paid at least the minimum wage. We must also take into account the findings of a recent survey by the Migrant Rights Centre, which showed that the au pair system is being exploited. According to the Migrant Rights Centre, the Bill would "create an underclass of migrant domestic worker completely removed from the reach of labour law protections". The results of the centre's survey of more than 500 people were alarming, particularly on the issue of working hours. They indicate that there has been a significant move away from the original idea of what an au pair should do. We are informed that the work done by au pairs far exceeds what is defined as light domestic work and amounts to much more than a few hours of work per week. The au pair system was underpinned by good intentions but it is being used to provide cheap labour on the pretext of being a cultural exchange.The fears and concerns of those who support workers in various settings must be taken seriously. Migrant Rights Centre Ireland data suggest the majority of au pairs in Ireland are different now. Many are older than before and many have degrees from universities in their home countries. They are expected to do far more work than under the original system. This work certainly does not come under the definition of light housework by anyone's interpretation. I do not understand the proposed council which could simply be another layer of unnecessary bureaucracy. We already have the Workplace Relations Commission. Why is it not doing more? It is not being given the resources or funding to do so. I fear that the proposed council could simply become another Private Residential Tenancies Board with limited powers of enforcement. Anyone coming to this country to work, whatever the setting, should have protection and be free from exploitation. To the extent that such persons do experience exploitation, there must be recourse to a legal system that will protect them. If we are being told that the au pair culture has changed and that there is exploitation, we must take this on board. I do not believe the Bill will do anything in that regard. It is unfortunate that those families who treat au pairs in a far more positive and inclusive way as part of the family are being blacklisted with those who have been exploiting workers.

It is outdated and irrelevant, as well as degrading. It attempts to further erode the rights of workers. Au pairs are recognised as workers, but Fianna FÃ¡il prefers to see them being classified in a subcategory of worker to justify the importation of cheap labour for domestic and child-care duties. It calls this form of exploitation a tradition and takes the view that providing for greater regulation of the sector is the solution. It is perpetuating two dominant myths, the first of which is that au pairs are young and inexperienced individuals from throughout the European Union, as if to suggest they do not deserve adequate pay. The second is that they come here as part of an education and cultural exchange programme. According to Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, only a small percentage of au pairs are under 21 years of age. Its casework to date reveals that the majority are older and highly educated, often with third level degrees obtained from universities in their home countries. Moreover, they are often experienced in a variety of professional fields, aside from child-minding qualifications. The Bill also uses the flawed concept that there is a cultural exchange programme in place. There is no such programme. It is an outdated concept and there has not been such a programme in any real way since its heyday in the 1970s. Fianna FÃ¡il may claim that there is a programme of this nature in place. The Bill will ensure a so-called cultural exchange will be used as an excuse to import cheap domestic and child-care labour. Tying an au pair to a cultural exchange programme, as opposed to the status of a domestic worker - this is what they deserve to be called - would only weaken the protection of au pair migrants in destination countries and bring about the following consequences. First, in respect of remuneration, the pocket money allocated would be below the minimum wage. Second, with regard to residency status, the temporary visa would be tied to the au pair contract. Third, the protection of the worker would be limited as the control of the employer or host family and the working environment would be beyond their reach. I find it damning that Fianna FÃ¡il has criticised the Workplace Relations Commission's ruling last March on payments to a Spanish au pair because it believes the arrangement should have been considered to be part of a cultural or educational exchange programme rather than work. Substandard illegal jobs continue to be advertised by au pair placement agencies. They fall well below the national minimum legal standards. These agencies are employment agencies within the meaning of the Employment Agency Act. As such, they should be required to hold a licence to carry on business.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	272	I am delighted to welcome the Bill. It is vital that the au pair sector be protected and that the role of the au pair be given a legal definition. I compliment the proposer of the Bill, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and hope the Bill passes through the DÃ¡il. I do not believe the Workplace Relations Commission's ruling earlier this year was the correct one for this sector. That is my personal opinion. Arrangements for participants in the au pair programme are significantly different from those for simple domestic workers owing to the cultural aspects of the programme and the accommodation provided for them. This must be taken into account. The programme embraces cultures and there is a long tradition of having au pairs in this country. While there might have been some bad apples and cases of bad treatment - we cannot accept this under any circumstances - I am not in favour of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The au pair exchange programme involves interaction between two cultures. However, it is also important that au pairs not be abused.  I welcome the establishment of an oversight body which will accredit au pair agencies and hear complaints from those working for Irish families. This is important. Agencies must be examined and there must be careful scrutiny. I do not want to see another quango being set up. It would be another big organisation. However, I certainly want to see oversight and respect for those au pairs who come here. The proposal will ensure they are respected. This represents a good effort to find a balance to ensure the needs of families are met and au pairs are protected. I know that there have been numerous cases of au pairs being taken advantage of, which is deeply regrettable. However, it would also be regrettable if the idea of having an au pair staying with a family to look after children were to disappear or be driven underground. That would leave au pairs in a far worse position. Often we bring forward regulations without thinking of undertaking an impact assessment. If the sector was to be driven underground, it would be akin to slave labour and there would be widespread abuse. We do not want to see this happen either. The rising cost of child care must be addressed. It must also be acknowledged that not all families are in a position to send their children to the various child care settings. There are differences of opinion in this regard. I was involved in the setting up of a voluntary crÃ¨che, a naÃ­onra. The State has put all of the focus on preschool services in the provision of the free preschool year and the second free preschool year announced in the last budget. However, in many cases, this is of little or no benefit to families owing to the manner in which the programme is run. This is not a reflection on the way those involved run the various organisations but rather on the system. This issue must be re-examined and the focus must be shifted towards supporting families who need child care services. The au pair programme simply involves one setting. Not only does it provide foreign students with an opportunity to learn about our culture, it also allows young children in families to learn about the culture of the country from where the au pair comes. It is important that we do not lose sight of the exchange element. The programme has been very beneficial to many families and is a two-way street. I knew several au pairs who had a wonderful time with families here and enjoyed the language and cultural exchange and living in Ireland with Irish families. Au pairs should be welcomed. What has happened to the Ireland of the thousand welcomes, the cÃ©ad mÃ­le fÃ¡ilte? They must be welcomed to learn about life with an Irish family, our heritage and culture. They must be given the opportunity to learn about an teanga, mÃ¡s fÃ©idir linn, the Irish language, Irish dance, take music lessons, etc. If that is the purpose of the programme, their role should not be limited to minding children or doing housework for several hours without a break. There must be limits and respect, an important word in this regard. It must always be a two-way street. I have relatives who have travelled to work as au pairs in other countries. They appreciated the opportunity given to them, the accommodation and the pocket money they received in return for light work and minding the children. In the main, they had good experiences. We all want it to be a friendly engagement, a learning engagement and, above all, an enjoyable experience for the au pair. I also know, however, that difficulties can arise in other countries between a family and an au pair. This is not unusual, but it should not be used as a reason to get rid of the programme, effectively by stealth. We must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, if one pardons the pun.  Deputy Thomas Pringle is right about the people who come here. They are now of a different age and have a range of experiences.The situation has evolved and it is not the young students who used to come in the past. They can be of different ages and have various qualifications. They are well capable of minding themselves and making complaints if there are issues. It is important that we would have an oversight agency to which complaints can be brought. We should also look very seriously at the agencies facilitating the au pairs who show interest in being placed with families. I know there are concerns about abuse and any abuse of au pairs should be dealt with seriously. However, it would be incorrect to treat them in the same way as domestic workers without any acknowledgement of the cultural aspect. The Bill represents a move in the right direction to try to have some regulation and have some respect for the situation of au pairs without destroying the scheme completely. It has operated for countless decades. I have had very many valuable experiences. I never had one in my family home, but I know of many families who have. I saw the au pairs with them on many outings and different engagements with children and with the rest of the family themselves. They holidayed with them and brought them to different cultural events in Ireland to give them a real taste of Ãireann go brea. It is very important that they would have that taste for culture. We always need to keep that to the forefront to sell our culture, our heritage, our dÃºchas. Au pairs should enjoy it when they come and it should be a memorable experience so that if they have enjoyed their time in Ireland they would recommend to others to come here. Those who have been au pairs can be ambassadors and support the scheme by telling people about their good experiences. If they have bad experiences, they should inform the State and it should be stamped out. I support the Bill.

#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	274	This Bill is required to bring legal clarity to the situation of au pair exchanges in Ireland. As has been stated here today, in March 2016, the Workplace Relations Commission made a ruling on au pair payments which, in my opinion, undermines the tradition of au pair arrangements in Ireland. Rather than being considered as an educational or cultural exchange, the WRC ruled that the host-au pair relationship is the same as that of an employer and employee. This means that host families must pay au pairs the statutory minimum wage, pay employer PRSI contributions, and maintain a detailed record of hours worked and duties undertaken. That food and lodgings are supplied in most cases is not taken into consideration. The Minister of State said that he could not support the Bill because "to attempt to address this issue by dependence on unqualified and poorly remunerated overseas labour working for board, lodging and pocket money certainly is not the way forward". The Minister of State went on to say that the current amount for board and lodgings was â¬54.13 a week. I welcome that he said it would have to be looked at. I have put a son through five years in UCC and I certainly could not find board and lodgings for â¬54.13 for a week. I have a daughter who has just completed a year in Mary Immaculate College and she had to pay closer to â¬180 a week. The Bill defines an au pair placement in line with its traditional definition and I think that has been lost in translation here today. The traditional definition is as a cultural, learning and educational exchange rather than as an employee-employer relationship. It adopts a definition of au pairs which is standard in other EU countries. It also attempts to crack down on less regulated elements of the au pair sector.  The Minister of State also referred to the seven hours a week - or is that 49 hours. Section 2(c) clearly states that this must "involve no more than 30 hours per week, or 7 hours per day".

However, this is the reason legislation is required in this area. This Bill provides for superior protections for au pairs and host families than are currently in place. By clearly defining what is and what is not an au pair exchange, the Bill also provides far greater protections for domestic workers who are taken on under the guise of an au pair. A new public body will be set up to provide accreditation to au pair agencies and ensure new standards are upheld. Importantly, the Bill also establishes new mechanisms for hearing complaints and resolving disputes on behalf of au pairs and host families. Without legislative action on this issue, au pairing will be a thing of the past and 20,000 families in Ireland will be left in limbo.

It was a matter that had arisen during the campaign. I commend Deputy Rabbitte on the swift manner in which she has brought the Bill before us. I also welcome those in the Gallery who are here to give support for this Bill and also to seek protection for themselves and the visitors from abroad whom they welcome into their homes. Much has been said about the WRC's landmark decision involving the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland. With this case, MRCI has quite correctly exposed the fact that very occasionally au pairing is being used as a cover for the exploitation of illegal immigrants as child-care workers. That exploitation needs to be exposed and we must ensure that we, as a society, stamp it out. However, I passionately believe this is absolutely the exception rather than the rule. I have witnessed very warm, loving families extending their welcome and great friendship to the au pairs they have in their homes. I welcome legislation to ensure au pairs and host families are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities. Like Deputy BrÃ­d Smith, I have had the very positive experience of being an au pair abroad and I have always resisted the idea of classifying au pairs as domestic workers whereby the spirit and tradition of the au pair being welcomed as part of the family to learn the language would be lost.  The lack of definition of "au pair" in Irish legislation has created a legal limbo for both host families and au pairs. On average 20,000 households host au pairs in Ireland each year. Most of them come from other EU countries and participate on English language programmes while here. Au pair placement agencies have indicated that this could be reduced by 80% if legislation is not brought in to give clarity to the au pair-host family relationship. This is a very common situation in Kildare given that 50% of workers living in Kildare work outside the county. I know many families who rely on the au pair system to help support their working lifestyles, and who consequently have developed lifelong friendships and relationships both interpersonal and with our country. Many au pairs' families come to visit and travel our country supporting Irish tourism. Essentially, the au pair is an individual who wishes to improve his or her knowledge of the English language by undertaking an au pair arrangement through residing with a family. These families, who have used reputable agencies, now find themselves in limbo.  Families now feel that their way of life is under attack. They have tailored their working hours, other child-care arrangements and even their choice of schools to be able to engage in au pair arrangements. In many cases these are families to which I referred last Friday when supporting the repeal of FEMPI. Public servants who have been hit hard over the past seven years need to find the best arrangement to suit their families, as they continue to work. Deputy Coppinger read into the record correspondence that she received. I wish to read into the record correspondence I received from a constituent yesterday. This public servant contacted me initially in March, concerned as to how her family would continue to function if she could no longer bring au pairs into her home. This teacher, mother, wife and education colleague articulated very clearly her concerns. She initially thought she would not be able to attend today's debate, as she would have no one to look after her boys while she was collecting her au pair of two years ago from the airport at lunchtime.The au pair came back because she wanted to spend time here. She agreed to mind the children and be with them while their mother attended this debate.  There is much more I would like to say about this issue, but I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Jack Chambers.

I acknowledge the great work of my colleague, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, in bringing forward the Bill. Since the Workplace Relations Commission's ruling in March this year, the issue of au pairs and the work they do has been shrouded in confusion. The legal and regulatory vacuum needs to be addressed in a proper and prudent way through legislation. What happened in the case brought before the Workplace Relations Commission was a disgrace. It breached all of the rights we want to uphold in this House. It is important to bring regulatory and legal clarity to this issue, rather than burying the cultural process of the au pair. Deputy Anne Rabbitte strikes the necessary balance in her Bill. Owing to the absence of legislation in this area, the Workplace Relations Commission took the approach of equating au pairs with domestic workers, thereby ignoring the cultural and other benefits au pairs gained from their work. I have been contacted by many families who have informed me that, owing to the high cost of child care, au pairs are the only form of affordable child care available to them.

#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	282	The families to whom I refer, unlike the family in the Workplace Relations Commission case, value and appreciate the work au pairs undertake. It is not an overstatement to say that, in many cases, au pairs become part of the family. Most au pairs have positive experiences with families here. The recruitment of most au pairs occurs via the Internet, which means that there is no opportunity for them to properly assess their working conditions and environment. This can lead to a host of problems and open up the au pair to potential exploitation. If the Bill is passed, the au pair and the host family will both have to sign a written agreement and go through an accredited au pair agency if the au pair exchange is to be considered legitimate. The written agreement will set out in precise detail the type of work in which the au pair will be engaged and the hours involved. As we have heard, au pairs will be required to work for no more than 30 hours a week and no more than seven hours a day. The Bill also provides for the establishment of mechanisms to hear complaints and resolve disputes on behalf of au pairs and host families. It is important to note that concerns have been raised by interest groups in this area which have an important role to play in ensuring the sector operates properly. The legislation will empower groups representing au pairs to ensure they are not being exploited or taken advantage of. I hope they will engage fully with the plans for the reform of this area. I am disappointed that the Minister has rejected the Bill. The Government has chosen instead to bury the au pair process underground, where au pairs will have no rights. The effects of the Government's undermining of the process will be seen in the future. It is a great disappointment.

It runs contrary to our beliefs to undercut wages, abuse labour laws and trample on the rights of others. Such behaviour runs contrary to the ideals and vision of the heroes of the 1916 Rising which has been commemorated and celebrated this year. I believe the Deputies opposite share these values. Next Friday which marks the 89th anniversary of the death of Countess Markievicz I will join others in marking the role of women in 1916. As feminists, we will celebrate equality. We have been on a long journey in the past 100 years. We have achieved the right to vote, the right of married women to work and the right to equal pay for equal work. With these thoughts in mind, I appeal to the Deputies across from me to look again at what is being proposed in the Bill. I want to be clear about whose rights we are talking about. As others have suggested, we are not talking about young European women in a gap year or part of a cultural exchange. Generally, we are talking about women between the ages of 30 and 35 years, a significant number of whom are from Brazil. Other Deputies have mentioned that the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland, MRCI, the front-line organisation in this regard, has reported that as many as 98% of these women are in their 30s, with half of them coming from South America. The MRCI's research which is supported by Pobal, the Department of Justice and Equality and the European Commission has some other disturbing findings. Over two thirds of those surveyed received no contributions towards English classes. Approximately 80% of them either had no contract or merely a verbal contract. One third of them had been asked to work while sick. The MRCI concluded that the levels of exploitation were staggering. Similarities could easily be drawn with the exploitation of Irish women who were forced to leave their homeland in past decades. As a proud feminist, I cannot stand over the removal of their rights.  Six months ago the then Fianna FÃ¡il spokesperson on children, Deputy Robert Troy, who spoke earlier in this debate shared the concerns I am outlining when he called for employment law to be extended to au pairs. The proposal before the House to exempt au pairs from employment law runs contrary to the ruling of the Workplace Relations Commission, as other speakers have identified. It also runs contrary to the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Bill seeks to distinguish Ireland as the only country in Europe which does not have a legal definition of "au pair", while ignoring the European Court's definition of "employment". The European Court is clear that "employment" is when "for a certain period of time one person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration". The International Labour Organization, ILO, defines "domestic work" as "work performed in or for a household or households". Surely the work of au pairs is covered by that definition. According to the ILO, such workers must enjoy fair terms of employment. As a Parliament, we must not water down these rights. There is no legal gap for the rights of au pairs. While the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation holds the lead responsibility for employment rights, I would like to speak about the issue of affordable and high-quality child care in my capacity as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Some Members referred to this issue. For three decades I have campaigned tirelessly for accessible child care. During this time I co-established An CosÃ¡n and the Fledglings child care centres which not only serve communities but also provide employment for over 100 people. In the light of this experience, I was very happy to see the vision of child care set out on Fianna FÃ¡il's website. The Deputies opposite and I share many common goals and I look forward to working with them to achieve them. Fianna FÃ¡il's pledge to ensure child care providers are paid a living wage is a worthy one and something we should set out to achieve. However, are au pairs to be excluded from such a laudable goal? I agree with the Deputies opposite on the need for a second free preschool year and that is now happening. I was delighted to confirm last week that an extra â¬2.5 billion had been secured to bring the total allocation for capital grants to those providing free preschool hours to â¬6.5 billion. From September, up to 60,000 children and their families will benefit. On average, children and families will be entitled to an additional 23 free preschool weeks. This will increase the total average entitlement from 38 weeks to 61. This extended provision will reduce parents' child care costs by approximately â¬1,500, thereby bringing their average saving on child care costs to â¬4,000.  I think we are united on the need to ensure children with disabilities have access to preschools. Last month I launched the access and inclusion model, known as AIM. As Deputies will be aware, this model provides for services to be made available to children with additional needs without having to go through the process of seeking a diagnosis. The sector has warmly welcomed this initiative which will benefit up to 6,000 children. I hope all Members will help to raise awareness of this important scheme. The first enrolments will start in September. Overall, we will provide â¬345 million for child care services this year, an increase of 30% on last year's figure. This is contributing to a public service and a public good. We are establishing quality accessible child care services. However, I do not see a role for this legislation. The issues that arise go beyond employment law. Issues such as the quality of care provided and the well-being of children arise in this context. It is worth noting that if the au pair agency envisaged in the Bill were to be established, it would cost an estimated â¬500,000 a year. I assure the Deputies opposite that we are on a lot of common ground. Our energies should be put into working together for the benefit of children, families and communities. I fully appreciate that families throughout the country have serious concerns about the high cost of child care.It is a personal priority for me and my Government colleagues to make child care more affordable. We are moving in that direction while at the same time taking necessary steps to improve the quality of child care, so families can be assured that their children are being cared for and educated to the highest standards. Data that has been made available to me from the Growing Up in Ireland study, which is sponsored by my Department, show that approximately 1% of families in Ireland rely on au pairs for at least part of their child care. I accept that many treat au pairs as part of the family, as Deputies have mentioned, affording them the dignity and respect they deserve. I also appreciate that many families have already honoured their au pair entitlements as employees and recognise the protection that is afforded to them under both Irish and European law. Nonetheless, abuses are taking place and it is wrong to ignore that. While the Bill seeks to protect au pairs from some abuses, it does nothing to protect their fundamental rights as employees which they already have. I always appreciate the input of Members and have an open door to their suggestions, ideas and policies, but I ask the Deputy to look again at the Bill and to return to the position outlined last year by Deputy Robert Troy. In a statement on 22 December last, he said that au pairs are currently working in up to 20,000 Irish homes with many being subjected to exploitation and abuses of labour law. He called for au pairs to enjoy the protection of employment law. I share those grave concerns. As I said, this Bill is not consistent with the affordability or the quality child care agenda being pursued by the Government. I note the suggestion by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, relating to a question to the Low Pay Commission with regard to the rates for board and lodging in terms of examining rates of pay, especially if that is included in the work of a worker. That might provide us with possibilities for a way of moving forward on this. However, the Bill is not consistent with our movement towards a quality agenda for regulated child care. In light of the considerations I have outlined, the Government is opposing the Bill.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	284	I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate. I will finish with where I started earlier. The Bill was required to bring legal clarity to the situation of the au pair exchanges in Ireland. At present, there is no definition of an au pair under Irish legislation and the absence of such a definition has created a legal lacuna for both host families and au pairs. The Workplace Relations Commission ruling in March 2016 on au pair payments threatens to undermine the tradition of au pair exchanges. This issue affects 20,000 families who use au pairs. In effect, they are criminalised by the ruling. That is where I started and I will finish on that point. I will respond to some of the comments made in the debate. Obviously, I am quite naive to think that I am elected to be a legislator. I came here to legislate and to work with like-minded people who will wish to legislate with me. That is my motivation and ethos. Let us stop the grandstanding. There are families who depend on the support of au pairs through the cultural and educational exchange. I am not a solicitor or a barrister. I worked with other people to draft the Bill so I will take all of the flaws on board. However, there is no flaw that is not unresolvable. We can work through this with amendments. One of the first was mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen. I thank him for raising it and I thank him for sharing his time with us, but I believe there are solutions to all that he said. When I brought this Bill forward I hoped it would be accepted by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and supported by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, but it has been the other way around. Fine Gael has addressed the Bill as a working relations matter and I respect that interpretation. However, we have laid out the lodgings as â¬54. That is probably the crux of the problem. We have undervalued the value of the lodging. The sum of â¬54 is a huge part in this. Deputy Coppinger is looking at me but â¬54 for board and lodging for somebody for a week is way below the cost at this time. I did a little research and in Drumcondra it is â¬180. Perhaps that is something we should examine for the future. Deputy Sherlock spoke about my modus operandi in introducing the Bill. There was a genuine reason for bringing it forward. It was not agencies or the like, but the families that are affected. I am aware that exploitation is taking place. I watched the "Prime Time" programme and I support the motivation of the Immigrant Council. I acknowledge there was abuse. However, I am speaking for the 20,000 families who buy into what Deputies BrÃ­d Smith, Maureen O'Sullivan and Fiona O'Loughlin have engaged in - cultural and educational exchange. It is where one embraces somebody into one's house, shares one's family with them and with whom one breaks bread at the dining room table. One shares the culture of what is good in Ireland. As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, it is a thousand welcomes. That is what I am talking about. I am not talking about the employer-employee relationship, because that breaks the spirit of what the au pair system is about.

I discussed the 30 hours with the Immigrant Council. The approach to this was to bring the Bill to the House, debate it and bring it to Committee Stage so we could bring everybody with us to that Stage, work it through and deliver a result. We could increase the amount for board and lodging, negotiate the amount of hours for work and listen to everybody's viewpoint. That includes the Immigrant Council, the au pair agencies and host families. That will bring everybody with us. Is that not what the new Government and DÃ¡il reform is about, to bring people with us? I certainly would have been very foolish to have walked out and not to have been true to myself. There are 20,000 families who have listened to us debate this. In essence, everybody, aside from Deputy Mattie McGrath and my party colleagues, is opposed to this Bill. They oppose it on the grounds that it is employment law. If we had the legislation last February before this ever arose, we would not be having this conversation because we would have protected those au pairs. Now, we do not protect them. I want to be accountable to the people. I wish to convey the voices of the 20,000 families. I am talking about youngsters coming from Spain, France and Germany who want to engage with and embrace our culture. They might want to go to Galway International Arts Festival this week or to the races in the following week, and they go to those events in the car with their families. On the other hand they might go to Dublin to meet their friends, go out and experience all that is good about it. Like the Minister, Deputy Zappone, I am a feminist. I stand up for women and I support the working mother. I support the mother who wishes to move forward and be progressive. That is why we need this support. The Minister has not once heard me mention child care in this regard at all. This is a cultural and educational experience. It is also about the idea of supporting and embracing the family. That is the essence of this Bill. This is what I am paid to do and what I expect myself to do. It is what I expect all of us to do - to embrace the ethos of the Bill and bring it to Committee Stage with an open mind to iron it out, support the families and hear what the Immigrant Council and the au pair agencies have to say about it.Most importantly, prevent it going to the black market and prevent it driving it underground, because that is what we are going to do. That is what we will deliver and that is what those 20,000 families will be left with, namely, no option. They will see themselves as criminals. However many more cases there are, whether it is 50 or 100, from today forward if the Bill is defeated tomorrow, because I will press it to a vote, we will say to families that they are now employers. Their day of having an au pair will be gone. They will be left with no other option. That is what the option is, but I have brought it to the floor. I have no more to say. I thank Deputies for their time.

I recognise the decision of the vast majority of Members in the DÃ¡il, but there are still questions around what is likely to happen with possible infringement charges against Ireland, particularly in the context of the possible extension of time beyond the nine months in the Bill. We have not got answers. I ask the Minister to keep the DÃ¡il informed of any information in that regard. It could well be a major cost on the public purse. As public representatives elected to the DÃ¡il, we need to have that information on the deliberations of the commission and the Oireachtas committee being set up under the legislation. The timeframe should be kept under review in that regard.

Deputy Kelly made some comments yesterday that I want to address. I went to Brussels last week and had quite a lengthy meeting with the Commissioner and his officials. It was a good meeting that went on for about an hour and a half. I was very anxious to explain in some detail the political history of water in Ireland, as well as the challenges we face and how we have come to the point of putting together a confidence and supply agreement with the largest Opposition party, in an effort by both parties to try to put a structure and process in place that can make recommendations that could garner the majority support of this House and, more importantly, of society generally across the country. That is what we are trying to do. It is no more or less than that. There is recognition that the level of division around water issues is such that we need to make an exception in terms of how we go about trying to address this problem and put a pretty unique process in place to try to deal with it, which is what we have done. There was a lot of confusion last night around the commission, the committee and so on relating to amendments. To reiterate what has been agreed, what we will try to do and what this legislation is facilitating, it is essentially to suspend water charges for a temporary period of nine months. That is why an end date is needed, otherwise it would be open-ended and, essentially, an abolition. It is not that. It is a commitment for a set period of time to allow an expert commission to be set up, which has now been set up. I heard comments yesterday relating to the individuals on that committee that were very unfair. These people are very well informed experts on water, conservation, the legalities relating to water and countries' obligations, and the regulatory and customer issues relating to water.There is a broad remit of issues that need to be considered without the political heat that has come from this debate over recent years, and this is what we have entrusted it to do. It will make a recommendation after approximately five months, along with a report that will be given to an Oireachtas committee for political consideration. Then, I hope, we will be able, through the Oireachtas committee, to come up with sensible recommendations as to what the next move is, on which we will then democratically vote, recognising that we have a minority Government and that future Governments will also have this issue to address. We must endeavour to create some level of consensus across the majority of Members of the House on how we pay for the most basic of natural resources and needs in people's homes, in terms of safe supplies of water and wastewater treatment. People may take a hardline position that we must drive through water charges, but this does not recognise the political reality of where we are right now and how people voted. We need a process that attempts to create some new thinking in this area to try to deal with our international and national obligations, which I accept are there and cannot simply be ignored. At the same time, we need to take into account many of the issues raised last night and raised repeatedly every time we debate this issue. This process is now under way and we will vote democratically. I cannot understand why many of the Members opposite, not Fianna FÃ¡il, seem to think the only way to deal with this issue is to vote democratically now and to abolish water charges. Why are they so afraid of the democratic process we have put in train, whereby we will vote on this issue in approximately nine months? What is the big fear, if they believe the vast majority in the House will vote to abolish water charges come what may, of putting in place a process that provides the information and knowledge which need to be contributed to the debate before we make a significant democratic choice as to how we move forward, given some of the disagreements about the legalities that exist which, I hope, the commission will put to bed? At my meetings with the Commissioner I outlined the process and why we are doing this. He listened, as did many of the experts from his office. He then repeated what the Commission has already said in its responses to MEPs to questions on Ireland's obligations under the Water Framework Directive and the Commission's views on this. There was nothing new there. We finished the meeting with the Commissioner reaffirming he would follow the process with interest and I stated we would get on with it. That is where we left it. The Commissioner said he would probably give me a call again this week, having thought about everything I had said. That was it. It was what I expected of the Commissioner, who understands the politics of this as well as understanding the details and obligations of the Water Framework Directive. There may, at some point in the future, be action taken by the Commission but we do not know yet. Clearly, the Commission has a very clear view on Ireland's obligations but I will not make a judgment on whether it is right or not. I would like an expert commission to listen to all concerned on these issues and others, including the European Commission, and to come up with an independent judgment on it. The commission has the legal expertise to be able to come up with this judgment. Let us see what it says rather than us dividing as politicians on the legal views we may have one way or the other. In this context, I propose that we pass the Bill so we can send it to the Seanad for it to complete its work.

I acknowledge the contribution of the Minister and his staff in preparing the Bill. As he stated, it is reflective of an agreement reached after the election with a view to facilitating a Government to find a pathway in the process, as he rightly acknowledged, for experts in various fields in the commission to analyse, scrutinise, debate and, ultimately, make recommendations to an Oireachtas committee which, in turn, will assimilate and digest them and, ultimately, put the question on the various recommendations to the DÃ¡il. A very informed decision will have been made during the course of our discussions and deliberations to arrive at this consensus, in an effort to have this dealt with effectively and appropriately in the full knowledge of all the failings of the past, without saying any more about it but also acknowledging the political reality which exists, and the intention of us all to ensure we can provide a water service that meets the demands of all society, residential and commercial, but which must be paid for. We acknowledge the House must confirm its intention to arrive at a consensus to pay for the service and ensure the service is made fit for purpose and is one of which we can all be proud. I acknowledge the Minister and his party came from one perspective and I and mine came from another. There had to be compromise and a negotiation. In any negotiation one cannot walk out with the same position as that with which one walked in if one expects to find a resolution. This was the spirit in which we entered the negotiations and the spirit in which we continue to engage to arrive at a consensus with which the House can be happy. I, and those who gave me the privilege to be here, can be sure the decision ultimately taken will be one which is much more informed than the process we left behind the previous DÃ¡il. I commend all those who took part in the various Stages of the passing of this small piece of legislation over recent weeks. I thank the committee for the manner in which it will have been - I will not say fast tracked - dealt with before we break for the recess. I commend the Bill, as did the Minister.

#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	294	I move amendment No. 1:In page 5, lines 7 and 8, to delete âadopting mother, sole male adopterâ and substitute ârelevant adopting parentâ. I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, 9 to 13, inclusive, 16 to 24, inclusive, 27 and 28 together. The proposed amendments are necessary to give the right to paternity leave to male same-sex couples that adopt. The intention of the Bill is to cater for same-sex couples on the same basis as any other couple. However, due to the interaction between the Marriage Act 2015, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, in particular section 177 which has not yet been commenced, the Adoptive Leave Act 1995, which provides for adoptive leave for an adopting mother only, and the Adoption Acts, in respect of which there is an amending Bill before the Oireachtas, there is a technical difficulty in the Bill, as published, regarding same-sex male couples who adopt that needs to be resolved. The idea is very simple. Paternity leave will be available to male same-sex couples who adopt. However, the execution of that idea requires, as Deputies will note, quite a few amendments to resolve consequential and cross-referencing issues to which the core amendments give rise in the Bill. Amendment No. 1 proposes to delete "adopting mother, sole male adopter" in the Long Title of the Bill and substitute "relevant adopting parent". Amendment No. 2 proposes the introduction of a stand-alone definition of "day of placement" that includes the term "relevant adopting parent" and it deletes the reference to the day of placement having the same meaning as it had in the Act of 1995. Amendment No. 3 proposes the inclusion of the definition of a "relevant adopting parent" in section 2, which is the interpretation section, regarding a child who is or is to be adopted. Amendment No. 4, in the same section, is one of the substantive amendments required. It proposes to include the definition of "relevant parent" in the same section, which is the spouse in a married adopting couple of the same sex who was chosen by that couple to be the relevant parent for the purposes of the Act. Amendment No. 5 in the same section proposes to delete "adopting mother, sole male adopter" and substitute "relevant adopting parent" in the definition of "surviving parent" with respect to a child whose relevant parent has died. Amendment No. 6 is one of the key amendments required. It proposes to delete "adopting mother, sole male adopter" and to substitute "relevant adopting parent" in the section in which entitlement to paternity leave is created. It therefore gives a right to adopting male same-sex couples to paternity leave. Amendment No. 9 proposes to include in the Act a provision prohibiting a person from availing of both paternity leave and adoptive leave. This could arise in the case of a male same-sex couple and is a consequential amendment of the substantive amendments. Amendment No. 10 is a technical amendment which flows from the substantive amendments and makes a necessary correction to a cross-reference within the Bill. Amendment No. 11 proposes the insertion of the new definition of "relevant parent", as amended by amendment No. 4, in the new section relating to notification of employer of intention to take leave. Amendment No. 12 is again consequential on the substantive amendments. It is a technical amendment that ensures consistency with the language used elsewhere in the Bill and is being introduced on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Amendment No. 13 proposes to introduce a further provision regarding the commencement of transferred paternity leave following the death of a relevant parent. This provision ensures male same-sex couples have the same entitlement to transferred paternity leave as other couples. As well as carrying the necessary amendments through regarding paternity leave, Part 5 of the Bill, namely, sections 30 and 31, in turn need to be amended to ensure the same result regarding paternity benefit. If accepted, amendments Nos. 6 to 24, inclusive, will therefore achieve this outcome. Amendment No. 16 provides that "âday of placementâ has the same meaning as it has in the Act of 2016;", that is, the proposed Paternity Leave and Benefit Act. Amendment No. 17 proposes the inclusion of the definition of "relevant adopting parent" in the case of a child who is or is to be adopted. Amendment No. 18 proposes to include in the definition of "relevant parent", in respect of a person in insurable self-employment, the spouse in a married adopting couple of the same sex chosen by that couple to be the relevant parent for the purpose of accessing paternity benefit. Amendment No. 19 proposes to delete the term "adopting mother or sole male adopter of the child" and to substitute the term "relevant adopting parent of the child". This concerns the definition of "surviving parent". Amendment No. 20 proposes to delete the term "adopting mother, sole male adopter" and substitute the term "relevant adopting parent" regarding the entitlement to, and duration of, the benefit. Amendment No. 21 proposes to delete the term "adopting mother, sole male adopter" and again substitute the term "relevant adopting parent" regarding the entitlement to the benefit of a surviving parent. Amendment No. 22 proposes to include a provision prohibiting a person from availing of both paternity benefit and adoptive benefit. Again, this could arise in a case of a male same-sex couple. The amendment is consequential on the substantive amendments. Amendment No. 23 is a technical amendment that is consequential on the substantive amendments and is again being introduced on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Amendment No. 24 is also a technical amendment that is consequential on the substantive amendments and is once again being introduced on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Amendment No. 27 is consequential on the substantive amendments. It is a technical amendment that provides clarity on an Act referenced in the Bill. Amendment No. 28 proposes to change the reference in the Workplace Relations Act 2015 from the term "adopting mother, sole male adopter" to the simple term "adopting parent".

It is my first time to speak while he is in charge. As Chairman of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice and Equality which dealt with Committee Stage of the Bill last week, I raised a very important issue. The Minister assured me that my concerns were catered for within the legislation. The Minister undertook, before the full committee, that she would provide written assurance that the issue I raised was provided for within the Bill. On Friday, the deadline for the provision of amendments for Report Stage, I sought that assurance by phoning the Minister. It had not come by that point, and it still has not, despite two further attempts today at the Minister's contact numbers. I ask the Minister of State, at the outset of the address of the amendments tabled by the Minister, to reiterate her assurance and point out where it is provided for in the legislation that, in the event of a stillbirth, the detail and provisions of the Paternity Leave and Benefit Bill will apply. I am very anxious to know this, given that the Minister of State, in his introduction to the amendments, indicated a list of areas in which it is the case. I am anxious to know with certainty that, in the situation where a stillbirth is the sad and tragic consequence of a full-term pregnancy, the paternity leave applies equally to cases in which the child survives. We will all understand that it is, arguably, a more important time for support for the mother than cases in which the child is safely delivered. I said this last week to the Minister.

It was important that the Minister, having undertook to provide written assurance of her response to me, should have done so. As Chairman of the Committee on Justice and Equality, I expect that, in future, assurances from the Minister and her officials before our committee will be adhered to and honoured promptly.

TÃ¡ sÃºil agam go mbeidh tÃº an-sÃ¡sta ar fad sa phost sin sna blianta amach romhainn. I join Deputy CaoimhghÃ­n Ã CaolÃ¡in. He raised the matter at the end of the committee meeting on the legislation and discussed it afterwards with the Minister. It is a very important point. It would be very unfair if we introduced legislation giving paternity leave to fathers in all circumstances and excluded the tragic circumstances to which the Deputy referred. It is to be hoped the Minister of State will be able to identify where it is in the legislation.

I apologise, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I should also have congratulated you. I look forward to working with you. Stillbirth is covered by the Bill. The term "confinement" ensures any father whose child is stillborn after 24 weeks is entitled to the benefit. I will personally pass the Deputies' observations on communication to the TÃ¡naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality. I undertake that she will commit in writing to what I have just clarified regarding the very sad and tragic issue that arises with respect to a stillborn child. It is very fair comment that, in these circumstances, the benefit is even more required by families.

I have gone through the legislation and, while the Minister of State is reassuring me that the term "confinement" covers the scenario I have represented, I would appreciate, for my peace of mind and assurance, the written explanation of it in detail. It had not suggested itself as certainly as the Minister of State and the Minister have indicated in the two fora in which I have addressed the matter. I hope it is the case and I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister of State's reply. We all recognise the situation I have described as most tragic and requiring every support for the woman involved. This would very definitely include the presence and support of her partner or husband, as the case might be. I look forward to receiving it and will bring it to the committee's attention at the first opportunity.

The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the TÃ¡naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, have discussed the Department of Social Protection's readiness to begin benefit payments. They are satisfied that a commencement date for the leave and benefit of 1 September is achievable. The reason a commitment could not be given to a start date of 1 September before this is that there was a question mark over whether the complex operational arrangements required in the Department of Social Protection could be completed in time for September. This is why the Bill, as published, applies to births after 30 September 2016. The commencement date of 1 September is in line with the 2016 budget announcement of a two-week period of paternity leave and the associated social insurance-based benefit payment in the 2016 budget. Any start date will, inevitably, leave some people on the wrong side of the line. We are sorry it is not possible to benefit babies born before September.However, there are approximately 200 births in Ireland every day. That is almost 6,000 babies that the Bill will provide for if these amendments are accepted and the potential cost to the Exchequer is covered in the Social Protection Vote. Amendment No. 7 proposes to delete "30 September" and substitute "1 September" in respect of the qualifying date of the placement in the case of a child who is being adopted in respect of paternity leave. Amendment No. 8 proposes to delete "30 September" and substitute "1 September" in respect of the qualifying date of confinement in respect of paternity leave. As well as carrying the necessary amendments through in respect of the commencement of paternity leave, Part 5, sections 30 and 31, need to be amended to ensure the same result for paternity benefit. If accepted, amendments Nos. 25 and 26 will achieve this outcome. Amendment No. 7 proposes to delete "30 September" and substitute "1 September" in respect of the qualifying date of placement in the case of a child who is being adopted in respect of paternity benefit. Amendment No. 8 proposes to delete "30 September" and substitute "1 September" in respect of the qualifying date of confinement in respect of paternity benefit.

The provisions of the Bill are, as far as is practicable, based on the corresponding provisions in the maternity protection Acts and family leave legislation. Section 22 derives from section 16(1) of the Parental Leave Act 1998 and section 16 of the Carer's Leave Act 2001, neither of which refers to threats to penalise. However, more modern legislation such as the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012 contain a provision that protects employees not just from penalisation but also from threatened penalisation. It is appropriate that we take the most up-to-date approach in this Bill also and, therefore, amendment No. 14 proposes to prohibit threatened penalisation as well as actual penalisation and amendment No. 15 proposes to prohibit threatened dismissal as well as actual dismissal.

We have broken from a non-starter into a gallop. This is the second Bill we have enacted in six months. This is important because a commitment was made to have it in place for September.

It is very progressive. It recognises, first, the importance of the family in society. The definition of the family has obviously extended and changed over recent years. We now have a very broad interpretation of what is the family. Nonetheless, the most important aspect of any family is in respect of the upbringing of children. For too long we have placed a great emphasis upon mothers to bring up children. This Bill now recognises that fathers have a crucial role to play but, more important, it allows the State to give recognition to that by allowing fathers to have time off to look after children in what is a very formative and important part of their lives. I welcome the legislation.

The programme states, "These issues will not be limited to those directly pertaining to the Constitution and may include issues such as, for example how we, as a nation, best respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population." That said, we will ask the citizens' assembly to make recommendations to the DÃ¡il on further constitutional changes, including on the eighth amendment, on fixed-term parliaments and on the manner in which referenda are held, for example, whether super referendum days, whereby a significant number of referenda take place on the same day, should be held. The assembly follows the success of the Convention on the Constitution. This was an important and imaginative step never tried before in Ireland and the previous Government accepted a number of significant recommendations made by the convention, for example, that the Ceann Comhairle be elected by secret ballot, that provision be made for the proportionate allocation of committee chairs using the d'Hondt system and that an electoral commission be established. Most significant of all, on foot of the convention's recommendations to the previous Government, on Friday, 22 May 2015, two referendums were held on the age threshold for candidates in presidential elections and on marriage equality. As the House is aware, the referendum on marriage equality was passed by a decisive majority. This was the first time that a proposal for constitutional change put forward by the Constitutional Convention resulted in actual constitutional change. It was also the first time that marriage equality was carried by popular vote anywhere in the world. Like the convention, the citizensâ assembly will be independent of Government. As with the convention, resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas will approve its establishment and it will report back directly to the Oireachtas. The resolution before the House today is closely modelled on the resolution approving establishment of the convention. The assembly will comprise 99 citizens and an independent chairperson. A polling company will be engaged to select 99 people on the electoral register to be members of the assembly. They will be randomly selected to be broadly representative of the electorate as a whole. Politicians will not be members of the assembly. This to allow for as broad a representation as possible from the public. The citizens will have ownership of the process and I would strongly urge anyone who is contacted to take the opportunity to participate in this initiative. They should not be afraid of that phone call when it comes. It would be a very interesting experience and all of us who served on the convention would recognise that it was a worthwhile experience. Politicians will of course have the opportunity to consider and respond to the assemblyâs recommendations when the assemblyâs reports are debated in the House. As Deputies will be aware, legislation - the Electoral (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2016 - will be required to permit the electoral register to be used in the selection process and that legislation will be brought before the House this week and perhaps even tonight if we get a chance to progress it. The chairperson will be independent and, as in the case of the Convention on the Constitution, will be pivotal to the success of the assembly. The Taoiseach has already promised in the House to consult the Government and Opposition leaders about potential candidates for chairperson. As I have outlined, the topics which the assembly will consider, as detailed in A Programme for a Partnership Government, are set out in the resolution. The citizensâ assembly will be asked to consider the eighth amendment of the Constitution, how we best respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population, fixed-term parliaments, and the manner in which referenda are held. The assembly will also be asked to consider such other matters as may be referred to it. Given its importance, the resolution sets out that the first item the assembly will consider is the eighth amendment of the Constitution. When completed, the assemblyâs report on the eighth amendment will be sent to an Oireachtas committee, which in turn will bring its conclusions to the Houses for debate. It is intended that the assembly will be established by October. The resolution gives it a 12-month deadline from its establishment to complete all its work and submit its reports. It is presumed the assembly members will wish to have expert advice available to them about their work. For this purpose, an expert advisory group will be established to assist the work of the assembly. The composition of this group will be a matter for the chair of the assembly. The use of such experts was a key feature of the way the Convention on the Constitution did its work. The expert groupâs membership may of course change at different stages of the assembly process to reflect the particular issue under consideration. The chairperson and other members of the assembly will no doubt be anxious to hear from a broad spectrum of opinion in carrying out their work. As with the convention, interest groups can be invited, at the discretion of the chair, to present their views when topics relevant to them are being discussed. They, and indeed the general public, will of course be able to make written submissions for consideration by the assembly. The Government will provide in the Oireachtas a response to each recommendation of the assembly. We will arrange for a debate in the Oireachtas in each case and, in the event that the Government accepts a recommendation that the Constitution be amended, the Governmentâs public response will include a timeframe for the holding of any such referendum. This assembly will belong to the citizens, it will be an opportunity for a broad spectrum of society to reflect and report on a number of key issues. I commend this resolution to the House. I am sure the House will join me in wishing the assembly well in its work.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	340	The motion before the House seeks our support for the establishment of a citizens' assembly to consider four issues. Those issues, as the Minister of State has identified, are, first, the eighth amendment, second, how we best respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population, third, fixed-term parliaments, and, fourth, the manner in which referenda are held. Fianna FÃ¡il will be abstaining on this motion for a variety of reasons. The first reason is that we recognise that the issue of the impact of the eighth amendment is a matter that merits discussion and consideration. However, Fianna FÃ¡il believes that because it is an issue of such sensitivity and complexity, it cannot be dealt with adequately by putting together 100 citizens in what is referred to as a citizens' assembly. We know the breadth of opinion on the issue in society and we believe that will simply be reflected in the citizens' assembly and we will not have the effect or result of any expert analysis as a result of a citizens' assembly looking at that matter. DÃ¡il Ãireann could do that matter just as easily.What we had proposed in our manifesto was a judge-led commission to inquire into the eighth amendment. A judge-led commission would have been able to call and question persons with medical and legal expertise and would also have been able to call and listen to evidence from various interest groups. While the Minister may say the citizens' assembly will be able to do that also, the difference is that a judge-led commission can provide a cogent and coherent report which carries the weight of a member of the superior courts. A judge-led report could outline and provide the Oireachtas with a series of proposals and we could choose which to follow in respect of the eighth amendment. For that reason, a judge-led commission is the way to go on this particularly sensitive issue. A citizens' assembly will not be effective. A report produced by a judge in respect of the issue would be intellectually coherent and allow us to look at the options laid out and pick one. Another reason Fianna FÃ¡il is abstaining in respect of the motion involves the other issues the assembly will be asked to look at. The second issue relates to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population. One must ask what, in effect, the 100 people chosen are being asked to do in respect of this matter. When they are randomly selected and included in the assembly, are they to come up with some proposal in respect of amending the Constitution? Are we asking them to come up with some proposal in respect of introducing new legislation or are we asking them to come forward with a policy on the ageing population in Ireland? It is very uncertain and unfair to ask a collection of 100 people to come up with proposals in respect of the challenges and opportunities an ageing population faces. The motion also proposes that the citizens' assembly considers fixed-term parliaments. This has been given inadequate consideration. Are we asking the assembly to suggest an amendment to Article 13.2 of the Constitution in order that the power of a Taoiseach to seek a dissolution from the President should be removed? That is what would be required to introduce fixed-term parliaments. It is unfair to ask a group of 100 people to give us their general view on fixed-term parliaments as the discussion will simply be framed by how such parliaments have been introduced in England, notwithstanding that there is a completely different constitutional order in that country. The fourth item the assembly will be asked to consider is the manner in which referenda are held. Again, it is a matter of cryptic uncertainty as to what is meant by that. Are we asking these people if they recommend amending Articles 46 and 47 of the Constitution which deal with the amendment of the Constitution and referenda? It is completely unclear what is being provided for in the motion. The motion recognises that there will be 100 members of the citizens' assembly. One will be appointed by the Government while 99 will be randomly selected to be broadly representative of society. If we want people who are broadly representative of society, everyone in society should be included and not simply those entitled to vote in DÃ¡il elections. It is not going to be broadly representative of society if it is going to be randomly selected from individuals who can vote in DÃ¡il elections.

I wish him every success. I know he will be extremely fair and bring dignity and honour to the post. After careful consideration, my party cannot support the motion tabled by the Government. A very clear and coherent argument against the motion was made by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan on behalf of Fianna FÃ¡il, notwithstanding his indication that the party intended to abstain. We will not support the legislation creating the assembly either. My colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will speak on that later in the debate. The first and most important issue to be considered by the proposed assembly is the eighth amendment of the Constitution. As anyone who has served in the House for any period knows, abortion has been one of the most divisive issues in politics over the past 30 years. When I voted against the eighth amendment to the Constitution in 1983 as a newly appointed Member of Seanad Ãireann, I believed the Constitution was not the place to attempt to deal with issues as complex as abortion. I was right then and my party was right to oppose the placing of that amendment proposal before the people at that time. Clearly, we must now address the broad range of issues which have arisen in the intervening 33 years. It is the solemn and proper duty of the Oireachtas to undertake that task. To seek to offload this difficult and contentious issue and to franchise out this really important work to what is, in essence, a focus group gathered by a polling company is wrong. Focus groups are formed by polling companies randomly selecting representative samples of the people, so that is what it is. It will not work and, bluntly, I consider it to be an act of political cowardice designed to long-finger an issue that should be addressed now. It is wrong for the Minister of State to say that this is analogous to the Constitutional Convention which was a completely different creature involving politicians interacting, debating and bringing their skill sets to the discussion of constitutional matters with the public. We have a citizens' assembly elected by the people of Ireland in a democratic election. That assembly is called Oireachtas Ãireann and, under Article 15, it has the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State. In an area as difficult as this, we should step up to the plate and do that. We have a challenging and difficult job to do to address this issue, but we have shown, for example, by the way the health committee handled the very complex preparatory work for the X case legislation, that we can do it. People have the right to have their views heard and to have them challenged and to hear the views of medical, legal and constitutional experts, but that process should be conducted under the authority and oversight of the elected Oireachtas. I am afraid the only reason the path offered by the Government is being followed is to bring about delay. This is a do-nothing DÃ¡il. Today is the first day we have actually passed a Bill since the general election in February.

It is a glorified debating society unable to make a real decision on anything. It would be bad enough if the only consequence of this proposal - and I do not think it is a consequence we should accept - was delay. My fear is that it will lead to further division and entrenchment of views on this most sensitive matter when we should be trying to map a way forward that brings the majority of people with us on the need for change. With all sincerity, I ask the Government to think again about the way it proposes to address the particular issue of the eighth amendment. We can look at a citizens' assembly to do other things, albeit I share Deputy O'Callaghan's views about the opaqueness of the issues being put before this one. I ask that the Government allows the only real citizens' assembly, which consists of DÃ¡il Ãireann and Seanad Ãireann, to set to work immediately to address this issue.

All mechanisms by which citizens can have further opportunities to participate in democratic processes should be welcomed and commended. There have been a number of successful endeavours in that regard, in particular our citizens initiative in 2011, which is clearly one on which the Government's proposal is modelled. Citizens' assemblies have proven successful in many other states including, for example, Canada. I do not doubt that a similar proposal in this State would prove useful. That said, we had a deliberative assembly, the Constitutional Convention, that sat from December 2012 to March 2014 and worked well. Sinn FÃ©in wanted to see a more powerful convention with more teeth, but we went with the Government's proposal. I was lucky to be one of the participants and attended every session except one. The convention, its chair and secretariat and, in particular, the citizen delegates did an excellent job and produced a series of first-class reports and recommendations. It was an uplifting and useful process for everyone involved. Sinn FÃ©in's amendment calls for the convention to be reconvened with a new remit. Among the issues set by the Government, it should examine matters that affect the entire island in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum as well as recommendations still outstanding from the previous convention, including that on political reform. I made our position clear to the Taoiseach when I wrote to him just before he took a memo on the current proposal to the Cabinet, but we still do not have an explanation as to why he opted for a different model and did not take our suggestions on board. I also encouraged him to consider the appointment of elected representatives, as was the case previously. One reason for the convention working so well was that political representatives worked alongside citizens in an holistic way. Given its all-island structure, it had members from the Assembly, which was positive. However, that approach is being abandoned under the current proposal. Sinn FÃ©in's opinion on the eighth amendment is clear and the broad consensus in the DÃ¡il and outside is that it needs to be repealed. We do not believe that there needs to be a further delay on such an urgent issue. Accordingly, our amendment proposes that the convention report on this issue within two months and that the report be dealt with by the Houses within one month. Anything longer would be unacceptable. It is worth remembering that the Government has failed to implement many of the recommendations of the previous convention. A range of constitutional changes were proposed, including the extension of voting rights to citizens in the North and to members of the diaspora in respect of presidential elections. The Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy McHugh, made remarks in recent days indicating that a referendum on voting rights for the diaspora might be held next year, but he made no mention of citizens in the North. It would be odd if an Irish passport holder from Derry, Belfast, Fermanagh or Tyrone got a vote after moving to London but would not get one if he or she stayed at home. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy English, might clarify the position before the debate concludes. The convention proposed referendums to remove from the Constitution the offence of blasphemy and to provide a constitutional right to housing. A proposal was also made for a referendum on the article covering a womanâs life within the home. A new convention should be allowed to give its views as to when these proposals should be put to the people. The Constitutional Convention worked, so why change it? I urge all Deputies to support amendment No. 4, which proposes to convene a new convention to provide for a more robust and deliberative forum and allow for more issues to be addressed than would the Governmentâs proposal.

It is a charade that the Government - both Fine Gael and the "Endapendents" - believes it had to devise. It would be laughable were it not so serious. One hundred people who presumably all have jobs and lives must gather several times and deliberate over a growing list of topics. Deputies have thrown in the Thirty-two Counties and the Green Party has argued for something else, but this is really about the eighth amendment. Let us not kid ourselves. The Government is struggling to find a formula that will allow it not to deal with what has become the key civil rights issue for this generation, namely, people's need to control their own destinies if they have unwanted pregnancies and the need to repeal the eighth amendment and legislate for abortion rights. This country's conservative establishment has clung to the Catholic church for so many decades that it no longer knows what it would do otherwise. It wants to push this issue off the DÃ¡ilâs agenda. Everyone outside the Houses knows this. The Anti-Austerity Alliance will oppose the motion because we recognise that abortion is the reality for thousands of women. They cannot wait any longer for this House to deal with what they know has to be done. They must leave the State, incurring expense, shame, secrecy and criminality. We need to recognise this, repeal the eighth amendment and legislate for abortion rights. We need to end the hypocrisy and cowardice. A referendum is the only solution. We do not need a citizensâ assembly to deliberate for a year only for it to tell us that. This is now common currency. Attitudes have changed beyond belief outside the Houses. In the previous Amnesty poll, 75% of people supported a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment but the DÃ¡il is preventing people from having their democratic say. The catch-cry from the Government last year when a repeal of the eighth amendment referendum Bill was tabled was that there was no appetite to revisit the issue. The issue has not been visited for 33 years. There is a Private Membersâ Bill to revisit the divorce legislation and shorten its terms, which I support. Is it the idea that we do not need to revisit something such as the eighth amendment after an entire generation? The Governmentâs current catch-cry is that it needs a commission to tell it what would replace the amendment. I have noticed another claim recently, namely, that a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment would not pass. Deputies who were pro-choice and so-called feminists are using self-serving arguments to justify sitting in a Government that is delaying on this issue. We can win a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment. One of the reasons that I am convinced of this is that I am regularly out on the streets discussing this issue with people from all walks of life. People have the ability to sway and win this referendum. Young people, women and others, will come out to support this referendum. AAA-PBP has tabled amendments to the motion. The first relates to the word "citizens". It is annoying and offensive that Deputies continue to use this word when referring to ordinary people. Ireland has a large population of people who are not citizens. They may or may not be from Europe. They are affected by the eighth amendment. A number of amendments insist that this fact be reflected. Will the Government at least allow local election voters to be included if this sham is to go through? The other issue is gender. A group of 100 people from all walks will decide on something that will only affect a minority of those in their lives. I completely disagree with that.This matter should never have been dealt with in the Constitution. Unfortunately, we need a referendum to get rid of the relevant amendment, but let us not have a group of people who will never be affected by the issue deciding on the wording and on how to proceed. Can the Government clarify its position? The Government is giving the assembly a year to come back with a decision on the eighth amendment. Will it agree that this is doing nothing but adding to the trauma of many women whose circumstances it would not deal with in the DÃ¡il last week and that the period should be shortened to three months at the very most? That is all that is needed.

It can be effective and efficient. The effectiveness and efficiency of the convention was primarily attributable to the fact that it was representative of Irish society, accounting for gender, age, rural and urban considerations, job, profession and the unemployed. There was an excellent chairman in Mr. Tom Arnold, who was fair and impartial in ensuring all voices were heard. There was also a very efficient secretariat. There were facilitators who ensured nobody was allowed to dominate the round-table discussions. We had a range of experts brought in to give their opinions. The politicians and citizens complemented one another and the process was very much mutually beneficial. We have the groundwork done and an example of how to do this right. It is vital that the assembly have an independent chairman who is experienced and respected and that it have the secretariat, funding and resources of the kind we had at the Constitutional Convention. There was a small committee that worked with the chairman of the convention. It comprised the politicians and citizens who made the suggestions and recommendations. It accepted submissions. Everybody could not be heard but the convention ensured that there was fair representation of voices and we had international input on occasion. The proposed assembly, albeit a citizensâ assembly, should have been envisaged like the Constitutional Convention. It is rather ironic that when the latter was first proposed, I believed politicians should not be members thereof and that only citizens should be involved. Now, because it worked so well, I am of the opinion it is better to have both. The current census results must be taken into account in the making of the random selection. I felt the under-25 age group was somewhat under-represented at the convention given our young population. The problem is our electoral system because we know it is not accurate. The citizens have to be representative of all the socio-economic groups. I am disappointed over the proposal regarding the timeframes. The Government needs to re-examine that. The assembly should report and make recommendations as soon as the deliberations are made. I do not know why a deadline of "not later than a year" was chosen. We need a much tighter timeframe, within which the Government will hold the referendum. I would have liked to have seen other topics proposed, including that raised by the Green Party in respect of climate change. I hope the assembly is not an exercise in kicking to touch issues that have to be dealt with. Since the Constitutional Convention worked so well, I am hopeful about this assembly.

However, if it is to go ahead, I ask that the amendment be taken on board. The Government has got itself into an absolute mess. The Constitution, when it was amended in 1983, led to the more serious problems that successive DÃ¡ileanna have refused to consider. It has led to the death of women and to the UN Human Rights Council condemning Ireland on more than one occasion. In the case of Amanda Jane Mellet, it said the treatment amounted to "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment". I appeal to the female Deputies to listen to those words. If they, their sisters or daughters were involved, how would they feel about cruel inhuman and degrading treatment? Reference was made to a violation of Ms Mellet's privacy and of Article 26 in the context of discrimination. Of the 5,521 non-English people who sought terminations in England in 2014, 68% were Irish. Of that percentage, amounting to 3,754 women, 135 were carrying foetuses with fatal foetal abnormalities. In Ireland, despite all the dire warnings about the floodgates opening, 26 women sought terminations owing to health risks in 2014. Only three were at risk of suicide. We are going down the road of a citizensâ assembly because we are simply refusing to contemplate what we must face up to. This House is the citizensâ assembly. We were elected to do a job and we should do it. The year 1983 was a long time ago. Women have died in the meantime. They have suffered in the meantime because an amendment was made to the Constitution that should never have been made. Twice since 1983, a group came forward to try to make the Constitution even stricter, and the people spoke and said "No". We should use our voices in this citizensâ assembly to which we were elected as women to force a change. Let us trust women. No floodgates have opened. It is a time to respect women. Let them make up their minds in regard to a matter like this. If the Government is to go down the route of the assembly, I ask that the Government take on board my amendment. It is a positive amendment on the inclusion of politicians and on the setting of time limits.

I wish to refer to my amendment, although I may not move it yet. The idea of a citizensâ assembly that will be convened to remove the right to life from the Constitution, among other purposes, is utterly bizarre. A constitution ought to reflect and embody the finest principles of a nation. How does the idea of removing the eighth amendment achieve this? We need absolute guarantees that, if the assembly proceeds, it will not be a politically choreographed charade with a predetermined outcome. Reference was made to the Constitutional Convention and its chairman. Deputies Maureen OâSullivan and Catherine Murphy were members of the convention. I was a substitute but I never saw inside the door at any stage. I am not saying the members did not turn up at all times. I, for one, never got to debate or discuss anything. The DÃ¡il is the legitimate citizensâ assembly. The idea of convening another undermines the legitimacy of the Oireachtas. We had our election recently. It took long enough to form a Government afterwards but the people have spoken. Some Deputies have referred to the issue of the eighth amendment as the most important human rights issue of our time. The MRBI poll in May had it down as No. 13 among matters of concern to people. It was certainly not an issue for my electorate. I canvassed from July until the day before the election. Perhaps I had a handful of e-mails but constituents certainly did not raise the matter on the doorsteps. There are serious concerns. Many people have indicated in this House that the proposed assembly is a mere ruse to kick an issue down the road. I believe this Parliament should have the power to make decisions. If the Government wants the people to speak, let them speak in a fair and open referendum. Let people speak without fear or favour. It is in this vein that I tabled my amendment, namely, that each member of the citizensâ assembly must declare membership of or affiliation to any organisation or group that has campaigned for the retention or repeal of the eighth amendment. We need to have a true and transparent process to choose the members of the assembly. This is important. In the new DÃ¡il, there are certain Deputies with only two objectives, as is their right. One is to repeal the eighth amendment and the other is not to pay for water. These seem to be two issues of core principle for some. The right to life is vital. If the eighth amendment is repealed, what will be put in its place? Nobody has addressed that.

I did not hear anybody say what they would substitute the existing wording with. Is there to be a free-for-all and an open-door policy? I certainly believe it is a matter for the Oireachtas and the people by way of a referendum on a constitutional amendment. There should be a fair, open debate without interference from abroad, as we had in some recent referendum campaigns, and without interference from the media. Those who want to speak should be allowed to do so without intimidation.Let us listen to all the groups that want to have to exercise their democratic and legitimate right to have say in this matter without being subject to bullying or intimidation. I refer to groups such as Every Life Counts and One Day More. They must be given a fair hearing and we should listen to mothers who have experienced difficult pregnancies but who chose not to go down the road that some people are pushing by means of an almost daily diet of calls to repeal the eighth.

I am simply observing that there is a constant clamour. It is as if nothing else was happening or we did not have a homelessness and housing crisis or people being evicted from their homes. Those are the most important issues facing us. An opinion poll carried out last May found that repealing the eighth amendment was far down the agenda when it came to the concerns of families and individuals. A small lobby cannot be allowed to thwart democracy. We should have a full and open debate and a referendum if necessary.

There is a concern that the citizens' assembly could be used as a mechanism for kicking this issue down the road and delaying full engagement on the matter. For this reason, I am concerned about the timescale that has been set out. We should have been able to deal with this issue, including by means of referendum, within 18 months of the general election. The election was held almost six months ago and once the citizens' assembly has been established, a further 12 months has been set out for completing the process. I do not understand the reason for such a long timescale, especially as the Government has not given a clear commitment to act on the recommendations of the assembly. In theory, this process could be stretched out for a further two or two and a half years. This is highly unsatisfactory and some clarity is needed in this regard. The Constitutional Convention was relatively successful and worked well in the main. The problem with the convention was that not all of its recommendations were taken on board by the Government or dealt with expeditiously. We must learn from that experience. I will discuss briefly the four issues selected for consideration by the citizens' assembly. While the first, the eighth amendment, is critical, I wonder from where on earth the third and fourth issues came. There is no pressing need for a fixed-term parliament and I have no idea what is meant by the reference to "the manner in which referenda are held". Why are we not using this opportunity to deal with some of the constitutional issues that arise time after time in the House? Surely these issues should take precedence. The two matters that come to mind are the property rights enshrined in the Constitution, which are spoken of as a barrier to tackling many issues related to property - including upward-only rent reviews - and the need to quickly address the Equal Status Act in respect of access to schools.  There is an onus on the Government to build confidence in this process. This will mean giving a clear commitment that everything will be done in an open and transparent manner, that the budget of the citizens' assembly will not be an issue and that the selection of the panels and chairperson will be done in a fully transparent and open manner. As I indicated, the timescale provided is also an issue. The Government should at least give a cast-iron commitment to take immediate action on foot of any recommendation that is made by the citizens' assembly. These steps must be taken to build confidence.

We look forward to the establishment of a citizens' assembly as a mechanism for helping to deliver a referendum that will enable Irish people to decide on this complex and divisive issue. We should, in so far as is possible, allow Members to vote on the issue as they see fit and in accordance with their conscience. We should also leave the final decision on the matter to the Irish people. It is useful to have a citizens' assembly to work out some of the mechanisms we must consider before presenting a referendum on the eighth amendment to the people. The assembly should also consider what legislative arrangements should be introduced following a referendum, depending on its outcome. My personal view is that it should be primarily the responsibility of an expectant mother and her doctor to try to work out what is the appropriate way to deal with a pregnancy, particularly where the pregnancy is in difficulty. We should provide significant support to women who are in such circumstances. We must also be careful as to the type of legislative arrangements we introduce. At this stage, more than 30 years since the amendment was introduced, it is clear that it has not served us well. Women are still travelling to the United Kingdom and it is not right that we have failed to address the issue and look after mothers in this country. I hope the citizens' assembly will be able to fulfil this responsibility. I agree with Deputy Shortall that the citizens' assembly should conclude its deliberations relatively quickly and hope the Government takes this message on board.  The Green Party amendment proposes that the citizens' assembly consider the issue of climate change. I referred to this issue earlier today. We must engage with citizens in different ways to ensure they become engaged with the issue of climate change. A citizens' assembly does not necessarily discuss only constitutional issues. We should use this format in a range of innovative ways, including to examine how Ireland could become a leader in tackling climate change.

I, too, was a member of the Constitutional Convention, which was established shortly after I was elected for the first time. My involvement in the convention was probably one of the most enjoyable experiences I had in the past five years because it allowed me to appreciate the views of citizens who were debating issues and arguing with a politicians in a normal setting. Ultimately, democracy won out every Sunday that the convention met, a consensus was formed and its recommendations were put to the Houses. I accept the criticism that some issues that some issues that should have been dealt with have not been included in the remit of the citizens' assembly. However, it is a little bizarre - perhaps it is simply a reflection of the make-up of this DÃ¡il - to have some speakers accuse the Government of using the citizens' assembly as a mechanism to avoid dealing with the elephant in the room, namely, the eighth amendment, and others argue that we are using the assembly to fast-track dealing with the eighth amendment. This mechanism is being established to have a reasonable conversation against the backdrop of the unreasonable conversations that occurred every time abortion was mentioned in recent years. While the issue may be clear-cut for some Deputies, they do not speak for me because I do not share the view that we should repeal the eighth amendment and allow legislation to take its course without replacing it with something. We need to have a conversation with families about diagnoses of fatal foetal abnormalities. We need to have a conversation about women who have medical issues or have found themselves in the horrendous position of being pregnant as a result of rape or incest. We also need to have a conversation with citizens about the thousands of women who leave the country to have abortions every year. In my humble opinion, we must have these conversations before holding a referendum on the eighth amendment. I would like to bring people with us, rather than lecturing them about what we believe they should be asked. The citizens' assembly is a means of having a conversation before holding a referendum on the eighth amendment. The Government will accept the amendment tabled by the Green Party. The citizens' assembly is a reasonable mechanism for discussing serious issues such as climate change and our 2020 targets. In trying to implement policy, however, this Government and its two immediate predecessors met considerable resistance from Irish people because we did not have proper conversations with communities or engage with citizens and human beings, as Deputy Coppinger stated. There is significant opposition to wind energy because we took the wrong approach to the issue. The citizens' assembly presents us with an opportunity to have rational conversations on our 2020 targets and engage people in the discussion about how we will achieve them using technologies such as wind, solar and geothermal energy. We must have this discussion in a rational setting as opposed to trying to impose measures on communities.This is an opportunity to talk in a rational setting about wind, solar and geothermal energy and all the options available to us as opposed to trying to enforce things in communities. That is an important list and we should add to it because it is not an exhaustive list. Some things have been issued but one of the caveats is that other things can be issued as they come up. As the Sinn FÃ©in amendment has indicated, it would be important for us to talk about a united Ireland and how we actually view how we are going to get there against the backdrop of the Good Friday Agreement and the fact the Brexit vote has been successful in the United Kingdom in recent weeks. For me, this is a must. We will be supporting it and we will be asking as many people in the House to support it. This will allow us to have the Electoral (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill passed tomorrow in order that we can get the citizens' assembly established in September. I agree that there is no need for 12 month to pass. Once the first issue has been dealt with, the report should come back to Government and the House. At that stage we can discuss it and decide what we are going to do next. We can report back as topics go by to allow the whole process to be finished within the coming 12 months. When issues come up, we can address them as a parliament. Then, if it is the will of this Parliament to have a referendum, let us decide what we are having the referendum on, what it will look like and what the legislation will look like afterwards. Let us do it. There is no reason we cannot do it in the first half of next year. I am asking for support. I commend the motion to the House and I am looking for as much support as we can get today and tomorrow to get this passed and to get the citizens' assembly established.

I do not propose to repeat the reasons he has given but I will make some general points. I acknowledge that the citizens' assembly model has been used previously with the Constitutional Convention. There are a number of changes in this new model which I believe are regrettable, in particular the absence of political representation and the North-South dimension. I imagine any demographic of 100 people would quite possibly include some type of political representation, for example, councillors from within an area, and not necessarily Deputies or Senators. It is wrong to exclude them. However, these changes are not enough to justify absolutely opposing it. It is fair to say that the previous convention was undermined by the lack of Government action in the area. Several reports were neglected and remain untouched. The assembly should not be reduced to the role of a talking shop because the issues involved are far too important. Furthermore, the convention should not be used as a replacement for the people's Chamber. In my view, DÃ¡il Ãireann is absolutely the people's Chamber. This is where we represent people's views and opinions. I have no doubt that each of the 158 Deputies get the opinions and feelings of people on all these important issues daily and weekly. We have to be the primary focus in respect of this. Ultimately, the DÃ¡il must wrestle with the key constitutional issues before a referendum and this is where it should happen. The mechanism should not be allowed to become a first choice of any government but rather an occasional infrequent tool for specific issues. The key issue is the eighth amendment. My party, Fianna FÃ¡il, is operating a freedom of conscience vote on this most contentious issue before the assembly. We were the first party to do so and we absolutely recognise the depth of the issues involved. I believe we should proceed straight to a referendum as opposed to having to wait for a citizens' assembly. The original proposal from Fianna FÃ¡il was for a judge-led commission to confront the issue from an independent perspective. The way the other issues are being dealt with smacks of an afterthought rather than giving those issues serious consideration. Again, this should not be the case. However, we are willing to help to build a consensus approach to the issue and we will abstain on the Government proposals rather than oppose them. The Fianna FÃ¡il Party will work to ensure these issues are dealt with through free and fair debate.

Recently, we had a debate on legislation which sought only to provide an additional choice to women seeking terminations for medical reasons. It was the choice to avoid travelling to England, to avoid being subjected to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. That evening and the day following, we had a very respectful and honest debate. Many in the Chamber and others watching outside were moved by the personal contributions, in particular those of Deputy Boyd Barrett and others. In the course of the debate we heard many voices in support of repealing the eighth amendment. The answer from the Government benches to the calls for a referendum was not "No". In fact, I believe it is rather obvious that there is broad consensus on this issue. The broad consensus is that we need a referendum. The answer from the Government side was that we should do the right thing, but not now. I realise that my granny is not the only granny to have said it, but it is never the wrong time to do the right thing. Therefore, I echo the call from an Teachta Adams earlier this evening. A referendum on the eighth amendment is urgent and we should not delay. We should proceed to the referendum as soon as possible. Kicking this important issue into a citizens' assembly is nothing more than a delaying tactic, pure and simple. Women know that this is a delaying tactic. I know they know because they tell me so. They know this is a serious issue affecting women and they know that yet again it has been put on the long finger. If there is broad consensus on the need for a referendum and it can proceed without delay, then all we are lacking is the political will to move it forward. I question the reason for the exclusion of political representatives from this assembly. Although I was not a member of the Constitutional Convention, I understand from my colleagues that those politicians involved contributed much to the work of the convention and were an asset rather than an impediment to its work. What has changed in the meantime? Why was a decision taken to exclude us? There must be and should be involvement from the very people who will respond to the outcome of this assembly. There is a role for political representatives working hand-in-hand with citizens from throughout the island. We will be missing out if we simply ignore this. Why are we moving to this now when so many of the recommendations of the previous convention were simply abandoned? Surely the time has come and gone for a referendum on the position of women in the home. Despite the recommendation of the previous convention, we still have not had a referendum or a wider discussion on the so-called position of the woman in the home. While we are failing to grasp the opportunities presented to us by the previous Constitutional Convention in terms of the all-island dimension and the political involvement, we are rushing to hold yet another convention or assembly of sorts. Anyone who knows me knows that I am fond of quoting my grandmother. However, I will instead quote my husband's grandfather. My husband often quotes this line. He maintains it was the best advice he was ever given - would that he heeded it, said she, looking at the unmowed lawn. He said that we should always finish what we start. The work of the previous convention is not finished, yet here we are seeking to start the process again. We have not finished what we started and we are preparing to do it all again. Government party Deputies will understand why people think this is something of a cosmetic exercise. They will understand why women feel insulted by the fact a discussion on the eighth amendment is getting kicked into another assembly when they see the inaction that arose from the last one. Notwithstanding my reservations, if we are to have an assembly, then we need to grasp any opportunity to make it as good as it can be. Amendments have been proposed this evening. I urge Deputies to support the Sinn FÃ©in amendments to provide for a more robust and deliberative forum and to allow for more issues to be discussed and addressed than the limited number put forward by the Government.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	366	Tonight's debate and the motion before us read like an exercise in political cynicism of the deepest kind. It is the kind of cute, clever politics that ultimately leaves people and particularly women cheated. The eighth amendment arose as a consequence of a particularly clever piece of politics by Charlie Haughey in respect of his opponents in Fine Gael. The eighth amendment should never have been put to the people. All of those eminent legal and medical advisers at the time who said it was an inappropriate thing to be the subject of an amendment to the Constitution in the way it was framed were overruled as a consequence of the kind of cynical exercise it became. The people of Ireland in their wisdom having heard the arguments voted for it. What is now needed - nothing will gainsay this - is an opportunity in the reasonably near future as soon as possible for the people to vote on the issues pertaining to the eighth amendment. While the consideration of the eighth amendment is the only reason for this exercise, it is buried in a number of other much less controversial items to be examined. These include the challenges and opportunities facing older people; the notion of fixed-term parliaments which exist in many countries and is hardly terribly controversial; and the manner in which referenda are held. To one degree or another all those proposals, while significant and important, are perfectly capable of being debated and decided upon in the people's assembly, which is DÃ¡il Ãireann. Instead they are mixed in with a proposal on the eighth amendment. As a consequence, we are kicking the can down the road on the issues relating to the eighth amendment. We had a very emotional and difficult debate two weeks ago over a Bill introduced by Deputy Wallace, which was pretty much a carbon copy of a Bill introduced in the last DÃ¡il by Deputy Clare Daly. Notwithstanding that it was very well meant, it did absolutely nothing to address the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities. Was that Bill capable of working? I think almost everybody in this House would have voted to solve the dilemma of mothers and fathers affected by that harrowing situation as they try to reach a decision about what to do. This is an exercise in the deepest kind of political cynicism. My guess is that many younger people, in particular, who probably were not voters at the time of the referendum on the eighth amendment, will see through this cynicism and see it for what it is. The proposal is to draw a representative sample of 100 people. I do not know how this polling company will work. However, when they telephone and ask individuals to use their wisdom to make a recommendation on the eighth amendment, it is hard to see how people other than people with an interest on either side of the argument would be willing to take part. We also have an expert advisory group.

Is that all right? I cannot believe some of what I hear in this House. I will give my impressions of what has happened tonight. Deputies may remember an episode of "Fawlty Towers" where Basil argues with German people and says, "Don't mention the war". He eventually says, "You started it; you invaded Poland". This is exactly what this is like. "Don't mention the war" is not in it because we now have this, plus all the amendments that cover everything, including the issue of an ageing population, whom the last Government lashed into by cutting the fuel allowance and the phone allowance. The previous Fianna FÃ¡il and Green Party Government cut their medical cards and the Government before that made them work an extra three years. This Government is about to close their post offices. The citizens' assembly will also discuss fixed-term parliaments, which means that if Deputies do not survive this term, they may have to fix their arrangements between parties rather than going before the people in an election. The Green Party wants to bring in climate change. Sinn FÃ©in wants to bring in political reform, Brexit, the Good Friday Agreement and Irish unity. The elephant in the room is the eighth amendment. That is why we are discussing this citizens' assembly and yet it is not being treated with the seriousness and urgency it deserves. When we ignore mentioning the eighth amendment, we are ignoring our history. We are ignoring Savita Halappanavar - who will not get to vote in any of these referendums - Miss X, Miss Y, Miss C, the 12 women who travel abroad every day and the countless young women - we are not sure how many - who wait for the postman or postwoman every morning to deliver a package that contains an abortion pill, risking being sentenced to 14 years on prison, courtesy of the last Government. It was a sentence inserted om the last legislation on the area, for which the Labour Party voted. Let us do away with all the hypocrisy and all the lies, and let us get the record straight. I did not snigger at Deputy Mattie McGrath earlier, but I laughed at the language he used such as a "free for all". He seemed to believe if the people decided in a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, we would be going into shops and saying, "I'll have that one, that one and that one", in other words abortion on demand. It entirely misunderstands women's perspective, what goes on in their lives and what their issues are. Would we seriously, for example, discuss having a citizens' assembly on a procedure that would help men live healthier lives, give them freedom of choice and probably even stop them from losing their lives? No, we would not. Even if we were to discuss it, would we throw in Brexit, the North, CO2 emissions, the whole nine yards? No, we would not. What we are doing here is penalising women again and denying them bodily autonomy. I lived through 33 years of the eighth amendment having campaigned against it. An entire generation of women and young men have not had a say in this and they are very anxious to have their say. They want to vote on getting rid of the eighth amendment and there may be others who want to vote to keep it. However, we should give them that opportunity. An old one like me has no right to deny future generations that right, nor do most people in this House who are my age and older, and indeed those who are younger. If we trust people, as we did in the referendum on same-sex marriage, we might get a result we do not like or maybe we will get a result we like. However, the point is to give this generation and the one behind it the opportunity to vote. I will make a comment on the make-up of the citizens' assembly.If the electoral register is going to be used for a lottery-style random selection of citizens, migrant workers will be excluded. This point has already been made by Deputy Coppinger. I reckon that a whole cohort of people who may ultimately register to vote in a referendum on the repeal of the eighth amendment, but who are not currently registered because they do not believe the system relates to their needs or their futures, will also be excluded. I refer to people who, like the 60,000 people who registered to vote in advance of the referendum on same-sex marriage, feel alienated from the system. I do not believe this proposal is reflective of society or of the needs of the people of this country. It would certainly serve to hold back women. We have proposed amendment No. 2 to take the elephant out of the room. We want to stop the "Fawlty Towers" phenomenon of trying not to mention the war. We believe that rather than using repulsive methods that involve kicking for touch and getting rid of the issues that really matter to people, the Government should go for the jugular by passing legislation that will allow our citizens to vote on whether they want to repeal the eighth amendment. As a young woman, I lived through the Ann Lovett case, the Kerry babies case and the case of Sheila Hodgers, who died in Drogheda hospital. We used to say we could not allow such things to happen again, but they have happened again and will happen again unless we deal with this issue. There is an urgency about this. The eighth amendment has been in the Constitution for 33 years. It is not like we are asking to be given another three months to have a conversation. That is what the Minister has said. We think we have had the conversation. People have made up their minds, so we should give them a vote on it.

Deputies have expressed concern about how the citizensâ assembly will work. We have also heard a great deal of praise for the Constitutional Convention, which worked well in certain areas. I understand that the recommendations it made in certain areas are still outstanding. This new assembly will not impede that process, which is continuing. The recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention can still be dealt with by the Government. This proposal does not affect that. It will not change that. The process that was used for the Constitutional Convention worked. I would say it helped to bring about the successful passing of the marriage referendum. I think most people would agree with that. I think it contributed to that process. It certainly enabled the referendum to happen in the first place. This kind of process has worked in the past. A similar approach is being taken on this occasion, although no politicians will be included in the citizensâ assembly. We talk enough in here. The assembly will involve a similar approach. The same method will be used to choose members. I know people have concerns about which part of the electorate will be used, or about who is or is not a citizen. The same process was used previously. It worked quite well and quite effectively. We are recommending that it should be used again here. That is what we are trying to do. I hope we are clear on that. Deputies have questioned whether the timeframe is appropriate. Quite a tight timeframe is being set out here. It is hoped to have the motion we are discussing tonight passed through both Houses this week. It is hoped that the citizens' assembly will be up and running by October. Thereafter, it will have 12 months to report. As I said at the outset, 12 months is the maximum timeframe it is being given to report on the four issues that are mentioned in the motion I have proposed tonight. Other issues might be added to its remit during the process. As the Minister of State, Deputy Regina Doherty, said, there is nothing in what we are proposing that precludes the assembly from coming back with reports on individual items as they are ready. It does not have to be 12 months. The reference in this motion to "one year" does not mean it will take 12 months. That is not what is envisaged. That is not the reason for the reference to "one year". If I remember correctly, reports on various elements came back from the Constitutional Convention after being discussed as they were ready. It is not a case of kicking everything down the Swanee as well. That is not what we are trying to do. The 99 citizen members will be selected on the basis of their entitlement to vote in referendums. They will be selected so as to be broadly representative of Irish society. If the citizens' assembly is going to make recommendations for changes in the Constitution, it makes sense that its members should be drawn from the electorate that is entitled to vote in referendums. I take Deputy BrÃ­d Smith's point that some people might not put their names on the electoral register until after the assembly has completed its work. While I accept that, I remind her that we used the same formula to choose the participants in the Constitutional Convention. People registered thereafter as well. That did not cause a great difficulty. I think the Deputy was happy with the result in that case. I do not think her concern in this regard will be borne out. We have to make a recommendation and go with it. Regardless of what method we choose, someone will have an issue with it. I think the method we have chosen will cover what we are seeking to do. I should also mention that 90,000 people from all over the world have received Irish citizenship in Irish citizenship ceremonies in the past five years. I expect that this development will be reflected in the electorate that votes in referendums as well. One would hope that all citizens would register to vote. I think I have dealt with that concern as well as I possibly can. I will try to deal with the Sinn FÃ©in amendment before we run out of time. The amendment proposes that four items should be added to the agenda of the citizensâ assembly. This would seriously add to its work. I do not think it would be realistic to give the assembly these additional responsibilities without extending its timeframe, which might cause delays in dealing with some of the issues the assembly is being asked to consider. As regards the items suggested, the last Government carried out a significant programme of reform. It provided for a radical reform of the Freedom of Information Acts, banned corporate donations and introduced the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015. It carried out a significant programme of DÃ¡il reform and commissioned a report on Seanad reform. Of course, the current DÃ¡il has made extensive changes in the way the DÃ¡il operates. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the last Government implemented a number of significant recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention and held two referendums in that context. The current programme for Government commits the Government to holding three more such referendums. Northern Ireland remains a key priority for this Government, for example in dealing with the consequences of the result of the UK referendum on EU membership. It will be important to make the best possible use of the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement to ensure we continue to preserve the benefits of the peace process in the North in this changed context. At the North-South Ministerial Council plenary summit in Dublin Castle on 4 July last, it was agreed to work together to ensure Northern Ireland's interests are protected and the importance of North-South co-operation is fully recognised in any new arrangements which emerge from negotiations. Ten specific actions were agreed to optimise North-South joint planning and engagement on key issues arising from the UK referendum result. This will include a full audit of key North-South work programmes to establish risks and likely impacts arising from the UK's planned withdrawal from the EU. The British-Irish Council will play an important role in light of the referendum result. When the Taoiseach attends a meeting of the council in Cardiff on 22 July next, he will meet representatives of all the devolved administrations in the UK to discuss the implications of the referendum result throughout these islands. The Government believes there is a need for the widest possible conversation on the implications of the referendum result for Ireland, both North and South, and for North-South relations. It will continue to explore options to achieve this in a way that is not divisive. As I said earlier, the proposed composition of the citizensâ assembly is aimed at reflecting the views of citizens who are entitled to vote in referendums. I reiterate that the electorate will decide the outcome of any referendum that emerges from the recommendations of the assembly, which will be able to invite and accept submissions from interested parties. Members of the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to make their views known when the reports from the citizensâ assembly come before the Houses. The assembly's report on the eighth amendment will first be considered by an Oireachtas committee before being debated by the full House. The Sinn FÃ©in amendment would impose a two month limit on the assembly's deliberations on the eighth amendment and further limits on the consideration by this House of the assemblyâs report on that issue. I would be concerned that this would be too short. The assembly will deal with the eighth amendment as its first item, which makes sense. That report can be brought back here well in advance of the 12 month timeline. I hope the Sinn FÃ©in Deputies will understand and accept the reasons we cannot accept the amendment they have proposed. The House will deal with the other amendments after this one has been disposed of.

The Government's response therefore does not even deal with those issues. The intention behind the amendment is to base the assembly on the same model as the Constitutional Convention in order that Deputies and Senators would be included, rather than a separate stage.

The purpose of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2016 is to enable the register of electors to be used for selecting members of the citizens' assembly. The provisions in the Bill are along the lines of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2012 passed by the Oireachtas when arrangements were being made for the membership of the then proposal Convention on the Constitution. When consideration was being given to the establishment of the citizens' assembly, the Government decided that it should have a membership of 100 citizens, including the chairperson. As set out in the resolution approving the calling of the assembly that was passed by the House a short time ago, the Government will appoint a chairperson. The balance of the membership will consist of "99 citizens entitled to vote at a referendum, randomly selected so as to be broadly representative of Irish society". As the citizens' assembly is not established by statute, it is necessary to provide in the Electoral Act 1992 for the use of the register of electors in the selection of the members of the assembly. Section 13A of the Electoral Act 1992 provides that it is an offence to use information in the register other than for electoral or other statutory purposes. Such a statutory purpose is, for example, provided in the Juries Act in respect of the selection of members of juries. As already stated, provision was made in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2012 for use of the register in the selection of member of the Convention of the Constitution. There is in place an edited register of electors which could have been used in the selection of citizens to serve on the citizens' assembly. That register includes 320,000 voters who have opted to have their names included on it. However, that is a relatively small percentage of the total electorate of some 3.2 million from which citizens may be selected on the enactment of this Bill. As to the selection process, a polling company will be commissioned for this purpose. Its brief will be the selection of a representative sample of the Irish electorate in terms of gender, age and regional spread. The selection process will be overseen by the independent chairperson of the assembly. I will now outline the detail of the Bill for the House. Section 1 amends section 13A of the Electoral Act 1992 by the insertion of a new subsection. This will provide that information in the electoral register may be used for the purpose of selecting citizens of Ireland to participate in the assembly. Section 2 contains standard provisions dealing with the Title, citation and construction of the Bill. In summary, the sole purpose of this Bill is to provide in statute for the use of the electoral register in the selection of members of the citizens' assembly. The Bill is required to facilitate the establishment of the assembly, the calling of which was approved by resolution of this House earlier this evening. I commend the Bill to the House.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	412	In light of the fact that Fianna FÃ¡il abstained on the motion for the establishment of the citizens' assembly, the party will also be abstaining in respect of this legislation. As the Minister of State identified, the purpose of this legislation is onefold. It is solely designed to enable the selection of citizens of Ireland from the electoral register in order that 99 of those citizens can be selected for membership of the citizens' assembly. Notwithstanding the fact, that Fianna FÃ¡il is abstaining in respect of this legislation, it is appropriate that a number of comments be made in respect of how it is proposed to select the 99 individuals who will play an important part in respect of the issues that the assembly will be asked to consider. It is stated in the motion that was approved by this House a number of minutes ago that the 99 citizens would be "randomly selected so as to be broadly representative of Irish society". As an attempt to ensure we get that broad representation, the Government seeks to rely in this legislation on the electoral register. In many respects, that is probably a wise decision since there are 3.2 million people on the register. As I said earlier, however, if we wanted a broad representation of Irish society, it would have been more appropriate if the random selection were not limited to those entitled to vote in DÃ¡il Ãireann elections, namely, citizens, but instead included every person in Ireland. We would have had a broader assessment had we included those entitled to vote in local elections. In the aftermath of the Constitutional Convention, which took place during the term of the previous DÃ¡il, there was some concern as to the randomness of the individuals selected to be part of that Constitutional Convention. We hope the citizens' assembly is effective notwithstanding the fact that we will be abstaining in respect of the legislation. Nonetheless, in order for it to be effective, the Government must seek to ensure that it is a random selection. I note from what the Minister of State said that it is the intention of the Government to subcontract out to a polling company the selection of the individuals who will be members of the citizens' assembly. The Minister of State's indicated that it hopes the membership of the assembly will be representative "in terms of gender, age and regional spread". I can understand how the electoral register could be used in order to ensure that there was a representative sample based on gender and regional spread. However, I do not know how the electoral register could be used to ensure that there is age representation on the citizens' assembly. It is also important to ensure that once we get 99 citizens together into the citizens' assembly, resources will be put in place to ensure that those citizens can carry out the functions - if this legislation is passed - that the Oireachtas will have asked them to perform. I do not believe it is sustainable or tenable to put 99 people into a room and ask them to discuss, for example, the most divisive and controversial issue that will be before them, namely, the eighth amendment. If it is a random selection, presumably the 99 people will have a varied amount of views on the eighth amendment. Some of them will no doubt be as reflective as the extreme views on the pro-choice and the pro-life side in Irish society. We will need to put in place resources to ensure that there will be a mediation or facilitation process in order that work can be done by this citizens' assembly in an adequate manner.  Those are some words of advice I would give to the Minister of State and the Government. If this process is to succeed, it is imperative that there be a random selection and that all parties and individuals in Ireland will be able to say that it was done fairly and randomly and that it was not slanted in any particular way to favour a particular viewpoint.

Sinn FÃ©in will oppose the Bill because this is the wrong data source and the wrong organisation to oversee the selection process. The difficulty with using the electoral register is that 5% of the adult population of the State is not on it. Those people are automatically excluded. This is approximately 200,000 people. Generally, they are likely to be young people, those on low incomes, people with literacy difficulties, Travellers and those who do not have citizenship or residency rights. All of those people have a right to be involved in any constituent or citizens' assembly, irrespective of whether individual parties agree or disagree with such an assembly or the issues it will consider. It is a mistake to use a data source that excludes those people from the outset. There is also a concern that we are only talking about those who have citizenship rights, the right to vote in referenda and people over 18 years of age. There is clearly an argument that other groups should be included when deliberating on these important issues. Therefore, using the census data held by the CSO rather than the electoral register would be a much more inclusive approach. To pick up on a point made by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, Sinn FÃ©in does not believe it is appropriate to use a private polling company. While the legislation does not specify a private polling company and refers to "persons", it clearly does not prohibit one. Irrespective of the subject matter or the purpose of the assembly, if there is to be full public trust and confidence in the selection process, the CSO would be a much better placed organisation to provide it. We would have much preferred to see legislation that used the census data and tasked the CSO with the responsibility to provide the members of the forum. On those bases, we are not willing to support the Bill. There are other categorise of people who are excluded. These include the diaspora, citizens from the North and people in direct provision and the asylum process. All of those people have a right to be involved in the debates of the assembly. On those bases also, we will oppose the legislation.

We spoke earlier of our opposition to the citizens' assembly, which is a delaying tactic and a charade for political expedience. Having lost the argument that it should not proceed, we should now at least try to have the most representative sample of 100 members. The Minister of State has said that the use of the electoral register by a private polling company is something that was done before in regard to the Constitutional Convention. However, it is almost a sacred thing that the electoral register is only meant to be used for the registration of voters. There are difficulties in getting people to register as they fear they will be placed under certain types of scrutiny and that the roll may be used to hunt them down for debts. This is a real issue because in many working class areas, the electoral register is in no way representative of the local population. In the polling district I live in at Lady's Well, Mulhuddart, the turnout in elections is often 24% of the register. There should be an investigation of some kind into the reasons for that. I was talking to a returning officer one evening who made the point that because of the huge non-Irish population there, most people do not have a vote in DÃ¡il elections and that therefore the sample is very low. I have raised this very serious issue before. Migrant women are very much affected by the eighth amendment. In fact, they are more affected by it than anybody else, but the Government does not seem to care. The fact is that they do not have the money to travel and probably do not have the freedom and visas necessary to do it. Brexit will be an even bigger issue. They will not have any say. Will any attempt be made to have migrant voices on the assembly? A lot of young people do not register to vote. The Minister of State may say that is their choice, but it is not good enough to do so. If the Government wants a representative sample of the population at large, to choose from among those who have opted to vote is not the best way to do it. This could have a bearing on the outcome of the citizens' assembly because, agree or disagree, young people have a much more liberal attitude on the issue of the eighth amendment. That will not necessarily be reflected in the citizens' assembly in terms of the youth population. That is my fear. We also know that working class people are not represented on the register. It breaks my heart on a weekly basis as I deal with people to help them with housing or other issues. One talks to them and finds out that they are not registered to vote. There is a cultural issue in working class communities on the value or efficacy of bothering to register to vote. Let us exclude the other assembly issues and focus on the first one, which is the eighth amendment. That issue is critical for working class women because they face huge issues around having potentially to save â¬2,000 or â¬3,000 to have an abortion in another country or trying to access the abortion pill outside the State and take it at home. Nevertheless, they will not be fully represented on this so-called citizens' assembly. The other really important issue involves Travellers. Travellers are excluded from many aspects of civil and civic society and registering to vote is a huge, generational and historic issue for them. We are relying on a polling company using a small sample of the population and no effort will be made to involve those minority groups. On non-citizens, the Minister of State did not get a chance to deal with the amendment we proposed to the previous motion. I can give an example from Dublin West, where one in four people was born outside Ireland. It is the highest multi-ethnic population in the country. A lot of them are now Irish citizens, but they are not registered to vote in DÃ¡il elections for a variety of reasons. I have spoken on this in the DÃ¡il but no attempt has been made to address it. Why are people not offered the opportunity to register to vote at naturalisation ceremonies? This is a very big problem because decisions are being taken that affect them. They live and work here and many are married with children in the State but they do not upgrade their vote to a DÃ¡il vote because they simply do not realise they need to. We asked for a simple amendment to include local authority voters in the sample but for some reason that was rejected as unreasonable. What efforts are going to be made to protect the people who are chosen from the electoral register when they are on the assembly from anti-abortion lobbyists or others who may target them? I am sure we have all been victims of threats. When one is an elected representative, one has to take that in one's stride. What about people who are not elected and who did not sign up for that kind of thing? I asked this before but I have not heard any mention of what will be done in that regard. I assure the Minister of State that the dire diatribes I and others get, in particular from anti-abortionists, can be very upsetting for those who are not used to it. I am sure others get it on other issues. Turning to the polling company, if the Minister of State remembers back to when the water charges issue was launched, there was talk about people's data being given to Irish Water. It almost caused an insurrection in the country. There is huge paranoia as well as genuine awareness about people's data being passed over.What safeguards will be put in place at polling companies or other companies that might use this information? It is funny that a private polling company is being given this task. Every time that attitudes and so forth are surveyed, the Government claims that it takes no notice of polls, yet it is commissioning a polling company to find the 100 people. Polling companies often use much larger samples than that. Many poll 1,000 people. It is late at night, but 87% of people surveyed in the most recent poll on the eighth amendment stated that they wanted expanded access to abortion, 80% believed that abortion should be available where a woman's health or life was at risk, 73% favoured the holding of a referendum and 66% believed that it was hypocritical to have a constitutional ban on abortion when women were travelling abroad for abortions. I could cite many more figures, but these already give a good idea of what we need to do with the eighth amendment without bringing a smaller sample of 100 people into a room. Has any consideration been given to the 100 people? I assume that they will have jobs and other responsibilities. No one wants to serve on juries. The Minister of State has told us that this is a weighty matter and will take a great deal of deliberation, but what expenses will be provided? I presume that people will be compensated for missing work or will it be the case, as tends to be in jury selection, that people who may be unrepresentative of all strata - self-employed or well-heeled people who can afford to be there or unemployed people - will be the ones there? I do not support this idea and will not vote to facilitate a waste of time and a charade, an exercise in kicking the can down the road. It is laughable that we are passing this Bill late at night.

The timing for Bills is no longer a Government decision. It is for the Business Committee, which decided that the House would not sit on Friday. That is the reason for being here so late tonight and tomorrow tonight. It is not my choice. I would facilitate any time for the Deputies, but that is DÃ¡il reform. It is working well for some and not for others, but that is the nature of the game. Deputy Coppinger asked why people were not encouraged to register at their citizenship ceremonies. I did not know it, but I have been informed by the departmental officials that they are encouraged. They are given the leaflet and told what is involved in the process. They are not made to sign up there and then, but they are encouraged to do it, which is positive. In general, most of the issues that Deputy Coppinger has raised about this Bill rather than about the citizens' assembly, which we debated a few minutes ago, concern who should be on the register. I agree that we have a great deal of work to do if we are to get the register right, which is in everyone's interests. It should be fixed once and for all. The system for registering should be automatic. I hope that we can commit to sorting this out together, as the register is not reflective of everyone who wants to vote. People are only discovering that they are not registered when they go to vote. It is unfair to say that there is a particular age group or social background involved. I meet people regularly everywhere I go and I get the same phone calls as Deputy Coppinger does from people who ring for help after discovering that they are not on the register. That happens to us all on a daily basis.

That is all that I am saying. It worked well. I hope that it works well and speedily in this instance. That is the intention. No matter what process we picked, though, Deputy Coppinger would probably not have been happy with it and would have found some hole in it. I can only refer to the convention, which worked. This is a similar process and I hope that it will deliver consultation and achieve what people want, namely, a referendum, among other things. Deputy O'Callaghan raised concerns about advice, help and expertise. Expertise, facilitators and mediation were available to the convention. The citizens' assembly will be independent of the Government. Likewise, issues of protection and so forth will be for the assembly and its chairperson to decide. Funding will be made available. The Government will not lecture the assembly on what it should do. Independence is the whole idea behind the citizens' assembly, but everything it requires will be provided. As with the convention, that is up to the assembly to decide. The Bill is concerned with how to facilitate the motion passed by the House today. It will allow 99 people to be picked. It is late at night, but this is not a complicated Bill. The use of the register is protected in law, but the Bill facilitates its use for this one matter. The data will not be shared. The polling company will not sample 100 people for their opinions. It will use samples and polling methods to find 100 people. Deputy Coppinger is confident that a poll of the people will give the result that she wants to achieve, but that is not what this Bill is about. Rather, that question will be decided if there is a referendum. She would get her vote then. This Bill is about finding 100 people from a sample of those who can vote in a referendum. I thank Deputies for their time and effort. I am conscious that it is late at night. I thank Deputies for their contributions. This is a process to engage citizens and was set out in a commitment in the programme for a partnership Government. It addresses four or five issues, but more may be added if the process works speedily. If the process works, we can hold a debate in 12 months' time on which is better - the citizens' assembly, the Constitutional Convention or some other version - but this is concerned with trying to effect discussion and change in a non-political environment. Deputies are chatting here everyday of the week, but others must be consulted.
