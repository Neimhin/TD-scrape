        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Yesterday, I raised the serious incident arising from an alleged paedophile ring in Dublin.  Today, I wish to refer again to an issue affecting our young people.  We have known for a long time that young teenagers are regularly getting hammered on drink.  We know now from a report being published today that they are also getting high on drugs.  This report is aptly called, The State of the Nation's Children — I emphasise the word "children".  The report shows that four out of ten children under 15 years of age have sampled drugs.  That makes us number three in the world for trying out drugs.  When it comes to girls, tragically, we are number one in the world for trying out drugs.  That is an 8% increase in eight years.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">When I raised the issue of drugs a fortnight ago, the Taoiseach stated: "I do not believe we should say... there are serious drug problems in every village, community and locality because that is not the case".  Fr. McVerry rightly pointed out drugs are apparently available within five minutes of any location.  We know the duties of parental responsibility include that parents know where their children are at any time and who they are with, but today's report is a damning indictment of the state of society in so far as young teenage boys and girls are concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_6">In the Taoiseach's view, what state do we have to reach before he realises the reality of what is happening and for him to agree there is a crisis that needs to be addressed?  Is it five out of ten, six out of ten or seven out of ten?  What is the Government's strategy in terms of constantly reminding parents of their responsibilities and children of the dangers in addition to the actions of the State in being able to address this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_9">In the past seven or eight years, we devised a national drugs strategy.  We invested the necessary resources, people and facilities in the strategy.  Approximately 500 projects have been funded under the young people's facilities and services scheme, which has been in place for ten years.  Hundreds of youth workers and outreach workers are dealing with this issue.  Regional drugs teams are in place.  There is a good nucleus of people involved in the prevention of drug abuse and in helping people get away from drugs and staying off them.  We invested money in sport, recreation and addiction counselling throughout the country.  We have a good basis that has been built up over a number of years with a significant number of people involved.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_11">The figures quoted in the media and referred to by Deputy Kenny in regard to teenage drinking and drug use relate to a survey which was carried out in 2002 and published in 2003.  The report is four years old.  It was published by the European school survey project on alcohol and drugs.  The statistics, together with other research from 22 different data sources, are contained in a report which has been compiled by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Office of the Minister for Children.  The report will be published today.  It does not contain any new information.  It is a compilation of existing data on areas of children's lives that have been identified as important indicators of their well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The report contained some very good news about children.  For example, Irish children rank second among WHO countries in terms of being physically active and involved in recreation and sport.  This is classified worldwide as being at least four hours per week.  I agree with Deputy Kenny about the fact that 40% of teenagers have experimented with drugs — let us get the word right, it is "experimented".  If a child of 14 tries one fag or one drink, it does not make him or her a compulsive smoker or an alcoholic.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">Under the national drugs strategy, there are a number of dedicated school programmes aimed at tackling drug abuse.  We should continue the social, personal and health education programme which is a curriculum subject at both primary and post-primary schools at junior level.  They are dedicated modules that focus on the prevention of alcohol and drug abuse.  I am in favour of everything that tries to give advice to people, makes them aware of issues and provides training.  I can rattle off a significant amount of resources that are being spent every day by people working in these areas throughout the country.  We have a good system trying to deal with the issue and good work has been done by the Garda Síochána.  I congratulate the Garda Síochána on its work last night breaking an international ring in Kildare.  It tries to stop those who make a living out of this, ruining the lives of our children.  While we have problems like every Western society, a great amount of work is being done successfully and we should encourage it.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">The Taoiseach should not try to put words in my mouth.  I did not say that every young person was experimenting with drugs.  I said the report indicated that young people under the age of 15 were trying out drugs.  I agree that definitions are important.  Cannabis is a gateway drug and leads to other addictions.  Some of the facts that have emerged in recent years include a teenager, high on Ecstasy, gouging out his own eye at a party.  Parents have taken out barring orders against their drug-addicted children to avoid eviction.  A 17 year old Dublin girl, a drug addict, was charged with loitering in a public place with intent to solicit for prostitution.  A 16 year old homeless boy begged that he be brought to St. Patrick's Institution for Christmas.  Heroin addiction ruined the life of a 16 year old.  It caused him to attack his father and wreck his home.  This reality was brought to my attention last night at a meeting in Dublin, where many children from the inner city leave the primary system with no hope and find themselves exposed to drugs on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">The Taoiseach states he is doing all the work.  In 1996 there was a total of 52 gardaí in the Garda National Drugs Unit, of which 47 were operational gardaí.  In 2006 there was one more, 53, to deal with what the Taoiseach talks about.  The Taoiseach is in favour of everything that helps, as am I.  Since I made a proposal for voluntary random drug-testing in schools two weeks ago, it has received strong support from around the country.  Pilot schemes could be undertaken in one or two counties, asking the schools to agree to a random drug-testing scheme on a voluntary basis to help reduce peer pressure and the incidence of experimenting with drugs.  This proposal would be helpful although the Minister for Education and Science does not agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I congratulate the Garda Síochána but the problem is out of control in some areas.  The price of cocaine is dropping due to a flood of it on the market.  It is addictive.  Fine Gael will support any action taken.  Does the Taoiseach support voluntary random drug-testing and will he give it his <i>imprimatur</i>?</p>

          <p eId="para_30">The Government set up the Office of the Minister for Children under the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to deal with all issues affecting children in an increasingly complicated world.  The issues of yesterday reinforce that point.  I accept Deputy Kenny's point and, if the boards of management and the schools do not object, I have no difficulties with voluntary random drug-testing.  I said that two weeks ago and have asked people to examine it since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">We should encourage what is positive.  When one sees a report that has so many positive aspects about children, one can see people going through it to find something negative and the headline focuses on the 40% of teenagers who have experimented with drugs.  Some children said they had sampled drugs but this leads to the perception that our society is drug-ridden and booze-ridden and that is unfair to hundreds of thousands of young people who listen to good parents, participate in active life and try to do their best.  The story from the report should have been that our children are the second most active in the world, according to the WHO, but that aspect is not worth a candle according to some people.  That is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Resources for addiction counselling, detoxification programmes and methadone treatment centres are important as are the resources provided for young people's facilities funds across a range of areas and in regional drug teams.  Ultimately, helping involves having good youth workers and community workers and providing resources for scout halls and dens and for girl guides to keep people away from drugs.  The absence of activity and of having something to do, leads people to drift to street corners, to the ghettoblasters and into drugs.  Activity is the solution to the problem.  Sufficient research exists to prove that.  We must promote resources for sport and recreation in the widest sense.  It does not matter if it is tiddlywinks or sophisticated field sport — each one is helpful.  This is being successfully done and we will continue to do it.  I support it and have provided considerable resources to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that all expert opinion agrees that the greatest challenge in our health service is the two-tier system?  Does the Government accept this is the cause of the fundamental inequality in our health service?  Public patients are treated as second class citizens, languishing in the community, languishing in queues and waiting for access to hospitals.  The Government's latter day response is the Harney plan to give tax incentives to private developers to build private hospitals on scarce public land.  The two tier divide at the heart of inequality in the health service will be worsened by the plan to build super private clinics on scarce public land.  Where did the Minister for Health and Children get the mandate for this gearshift towards medicine for profit?  It was not included in the manifesto or in An Agreed Programme for Government.  It is a reversal of the health strategy published by the two Government parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Have contracts been prepared and will they be signed on the eve of the election to hand over public sites to private developers and investors to make profit from health, which is a community service and not a commodity?  Is it the intention of the Government to sign such contracts in advance of the general election?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_35">One aspect of Government policy is to increase the number of beds, which is needed.  There are 52 acute hospitals and there is a problem with seven or eight, and two or three at any one time, where we require more beds so that acute hospitals can refer patients who do not require intensive care to other locations.  We must deal with the bed situation, the biggest problem in the health service.  Arising from this, the co-location initiative was to invite private investment to free 1,000 beds now in public hospitals.  This will add more quickly to the overall capacity.  These services will be bought for public patients.  If Deputy Rabbitte asked if I was in favour of co-location beds on the sites of public hospitals — he is right to say the sites are scarce — that would never be accessible to any public patients and would not stand down the 1,000 beds designated as private or semi-private in public hospitals, I would be against such a proposal.  That is a clear statement.  The Deputy asked if I was for or against a proposal that takes over 1,000 beds currently in designated public hospitals being taken up by private patients, creating at times a delay and difficulties for public patients coming in I am not against that.  That is a sensible thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">In regard to co-location I will cite the example I know best for obvious reasons.  For over 120 years there has been co-location on the site of my former employment, the Mater Hospital, where the public hospital operated as such and the private hospital has worked since 1860.  There is no difficulty there.  The doctors on the campus move from one hospital to another.</p>

The Taoiseach knows that and he knows there is hypocrisy at the heart of the aspiration in the negotiation with consultants which reinforces the two-tier system.  The Taoiseach will permit further cherrypicking of the simple procedures that are profitable and leave the complex medical specialisms and teaching obligations to the public service, facilitating a migration of personnel to the private sector.

          <p eId="para_96">I listened to the questions asked by Deputy Joe Higgins yesterday and I am glad my colleague in the Technical Group raised the issue of climate change.  Last Monday we heard from the Institute of European Affairs about the challenges being faced.  Throughout Europe people are talking about how we will reduce emissions to 20% below 1990 levels.  In this country there has been a 7% growth in transport per annum instead of a reduction.  We are faced with trying to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by a third.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The Taoiseach appears to be making change hard for himself and I wonder if that is necessary.  Deloitte &amp; Touche recommended that the transmission grid should be separated from the country's generation capacity.  The ESB, therefore, would not be in charge of the grid any more but would be a separate concern.  The Kish Bank offshore project was given a support mechanism for 2003 but was left in the hands of the ESB and there is no movement on that.  Does the Taoiseach not get the message that the ESB is dragging its heels?  The Government must give a direction as to how things must proceed.  At the same time, Irish companies such as Airtricity and OpenHydro are throwing their hands up in despair and heading to places such as Scotland, Texas or China to invest and make enough electricity to keep Ireland going.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The Taoiseach is not giving direction to the ESB.  Why has the interconnector been delayed for four years?  There is no facility for small producers in the domestic sector to sell to the grid, even though that is possible in other developed countries such as Australia, America and European states.  Will the Taoiseach separate the grid from the generation sector?  Will he direct the ESB to install smart metering in every home within five years?  It could save a considerable amount on household electricity bills as well as improve the country's ability to deal with climate change.  Why has there been a delay with the interconnector, which would help in this regard?  A four year delay is inexplicable.  Finally, will the Taoiseach give a direction to the ESB that it is time to go green and that it must ensure we are self reliant in renewable energy?  The way it is going at present is wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">As I said yesterday, all these issues will be dealt with in the White Paper.  We published a Green Paper and there has been a good, wide consultation process.  The White Paper will be published shortly.  We have engaged with the wider market on all the issues mentioned by the Deputy.  Obviously, we have had discussions with Airtricity, the ESB and others.  They have a view and input on this issue.  It is not up to us to direct them.  We must make the policy decisions and we will do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">There is a Cabinet committee on this issue and a large number of Ministers have been involved in it.  They worked on the preparation of the Green Paper and are working on the White Paper, which will be brought forward by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  The White Paper, as well as the new national climate change strategy, will be brought forward before Easter.  It is not fair to state the interconnector has been delayed for four years.  Work on the interconnector is ongoing.  We cannot move more quickly on it.  I was with the Minister when he outlined that to the press conference.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">Ownership rather than independence is the issue in terms of operating the system.  I would like to press that, but not here.  The concept of smart metering is gaining considerable support internationally as a way for householders to gain greater control over their electricity consumption and as a means of feeding back into the grid domestically generated electricity, be it from a farm, photovoltaic cells, biomass or wind turbines.  We do not have that facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">It is ironic that the New Economics Foundation in the UK says microgeneration could save that country £35 million per year and that it is cheaper and faster to bring about than solar generation in terms of the energy effect, while, at the same time, there are reports that the ESB is interested in considering joining forces with a nuclear power producer to import French nuclear energy.  Is it not time for the Taoiseach to put his foot down?  If he is serious about being anti-nuclear, he should at least let the Irish producer sell into the grid before the French nuclear producer.  There must be a priority in this area.  Is the Taoiseach serious about turning this country round and giving it the energy supply it needs from green, clean, renewable sources or will he continue to pander to the French nuclear industry through the ESB?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_139">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">In December 2006, the Government approved a major review of the public service, which is being undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  Its two main objectives are to benchmark the public service against those in other comparable countries and to make recommendations on future directions for public service reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_141">The review's terms of reference have been published and are available on my Department's website.  For the OECD to develop this systems level approach and to apply it in the first instance to Ireland, we are increasing our contribution to the OECD on a once-off basis by €490,000.  I expect the review to be completed by the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">A high level steering group of senior officials, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, is overseeing the review.  There is a consultation dimension to the review and appropriate arrangements will be put in place to allow stakeholders and interested parties to contribute their views.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">While the review is not a detailed audit of individual sectors, such as health, education, local government, it is examining the effectiveness of arrangements through which Government objectives are translated into outputs and outcomes.  It is focussing on the connections between the different sectors, including the links between Departments, offices and local government, the health and education sectors, with a particular focus on delivery of quality public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">Since the introduction of the strategic management initiative in 1997, significant change and modernisation has already taken place in the public service.  It is timely to begin to map out a new phase of the change and modernisation programme, building on the significant change that has occurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">Work is continuing on change and modernisation and ongoing improvements are being made through the quality customer service initiative.  Considerable progress has been made in this, including the development of core customer service principles, development of action plans by each Department and office, and improvement of complaints procedures and clearer appeals systems.  I accept further improvements are needed.  Public service organisations must constantly respond to and anticipate the needs of an increasingly diverse and demanding customer base, who as citizens, rightly expect, that they will receive the highest standards of service from their public servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">Several groups are actively working in this area.  The quality customer service officers' network continues to work intensively on the development and promotion of the customer charter initiative, including its extension to bodies under the aegis of Departments and offices.  The charter process is an important initiative whereby public service organisations are asked to publicly commit to service standards and report on progress made.  To ensure the charters are being adopted and used consistently across Departments and offices, an independent assessment is being undertaken by external consultants.  A report is expected in the coming weeks and this will inform the next phase of the customer charter process and help to embed it further in public service organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">The quality customer service research group was involved in the commissioning of a major survey of customer satisfaction levels and attitudes towards Departments and offices.  The results were published in 2006 and are available on the change and modernisation website, <i>www.bettergov.ie</i>.  Further surveys will be undertaken as they provide important information about the levels of satisfaction and the quality of services being delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">Awareness of the importance of better customer service is increasing across the public service.  For example, last year in Dublin Castle, I presented 20 public service excellence awards to projects that made a significant contribution in this area.  These awards are made every two years and submissions for the 2008 awards will be invited from across the public service towards the end of this year.  The winning projects last year were selected from more than 150 applications, almost all of which were making a real improvement to the services being delivered on the ground in key areas such as health, education and local government services.</p>

            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_149">If one were to decipher the reply and translate it into reality, matters would seem very different on the ground.  The reply is very far removed from the reality.  The late John Boland, when dealing with public service reform, introduced a requirement that one could read the signatures on all letters emanating from public service offices and that the public could make contact with the signatory or signatories.  From many of the letters I receive, this requirement seems to have gone by the wayside as many of the signatures are illegible.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">Many planning offices in local authorities are cramped, with people whispering their business to officials.  Last week, an accident and emergency consultant at Beaumont Hospital informed me that he must assess patients in the department in front of other patients, leaving them with no privacy or dignity.  Many doctors tell me they have to carry out physical examinations in full view of other patients.  This is what the review should examine.  Taxpayers who look for a public service should expect a certain standard that respects their privacy and dignity.  I know the Taoiseach would aspire to the highest standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">One principle of the quality customer service for customers and clients of the Civil Service, states that it should "provide clean, accessible public offices that ensure privacy, comply with occupational and safety standards and, as part of this, facilitate access for people with disabilities and others with specific needs".  What is the extent of public buildings that do not have access for persons with disabilities?  It is difficult to make practical access available in some older Government buildings because they have preservation orders.  Has an audit been undertaken of public buildings in which preservation orders have not applied that do not have access for persons with disabilities?</p>

The steering groups involved mainly comprise officials, Secretaries General from the Civil Service and the Revenue Commissioners.  They are pressing the initiative out to agencies under the aegis of the Civil Service.  They have improved staff training, undertaken modernising public service premises, ensure people are treated with courtesy and dignity and are able to identify who is dealing with what.  They have basically followed the principles set down in the customer charter process.  The steering groups meet regularly, if not weekly, and press on with improving standards and other matters such as the simplification of forms and dealing with the public in a helpful way.  They have made much progress.  I accept the Deputy's point is valid, that a member of the public should be able to ring a section and speak to named individuals.  I will raise the point made by Deputy Kenny on signatures.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">The initiative is being extended to bodies under the aegis of Departments and offices.  The OECD review will examine the links between the various sectors, Departments and offices and local government, health and education sectors with a particular focus on delivery of quality public services.  The review will be completed this year.  A range of meetings have already taken place between key civil servants and the OECD.  Various committees have been established, mainly at assistant secretary level, to examine best practice in other countries.  Other countries have embarked on these reviews and many models are available, so we will not have to reinvent the wheel.  It is therefore a case of opening the Civil Service and forging links to achieve better standards and practices.  That process has started at a Government level and should be complete by the end of the year.  It will be next year before the OECD report is ready.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">I do not have a figure for the buildings.  However, I know that last year when we published the sectoral plans for the disabilities lobby, very few Government or public buildings were not covered.  There are some specific problems, but most buildings are now readily accessible.  One reason for the sectoral plans was to try to eliminate other difficulties, inequalities and deficiencies in Departments and agencies.  Those covered everything from buses to health clinics.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">Under the sectoral plans there is now a commitment to deal with those issues within a fixed period.  Although I cannot remember all the detail, the general view at the meetings was that if the sectoral plans were implemented, that would by and large eliminate the difficulties.  While there might be some very old buildings where compliance would be difficult, it would be true of most services, and certainly in the case of all those introduced in recent years.  Those are included and offer good access.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">Regarding communications, as one goes around public buildings, one always wishes that there might be another way and that officials might deal with people in private rooms rather than talking through screens and barriers, which can be quite intimidating.  Of course, staff will give one all sorts of reasons it should be so, but it is not my favourite atmosphere.  None of us in the House does that when we have our clinics, at which we must all deal with difficult people on occasion.  We do not place barriers between us.  It is a little unfortunate, but staff unions and associations are very reluctant to change, since if there are incidents, members are not very receptive to new ideas.  They say that they do it where possible, but there are many reasons they cannot.</p>

            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_159">Perhaps that is part of the problem.  Since when did the OECD have any expertise in this area?  Is it recruiting consultants in Ireland?  I will reserve judgment until I read the Taoiseach's answer, but I am still not clear what the review will do.  Perhaps he might put it into simpler English.  Does it take the OECD to provide citizens with the opportunity to dial someone in the public service and get a human being on the end of the telephone?  People of advanced years are often told to push the hash or star key, and then dial 333 and so on.  That is extraordinary; when it comes to delivery of service, it would be tremendous if we could assure the public of a human response.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">Does it take the OECD to improve the normal service of the Garda Síochána?  The Taoiseach is well aware that there are parts of this city where citizens must dial 999 if they want a garda to reply.  I recently heard of the case of a father and son who visited a Garda station by appointment.  The inspector who was to meet them was not there.  That can happen, and there may have been a good reason.  However, they had been at the counter for 22 minutes when the young man used his mobile telephone to dial the Garda station to get the garda from behind the counter to come out and ask them what they wanted.</p>

            <p eId="para_163">I believe that I recently read that some bright spark in the public service wanted to dig out the Chamber and install a new one for us with plywood and modern gadgetry.  I sincerely hope that the Taoiseach will not permit that.  There is absolutely no need to dig out the Chamber just because someone wishes us to be an intelligent island at the leading edge of technology, as happened in the case of the electronic voting machines.  That is so much nonsense.</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_122">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_164">Under the 1924 Act, taoisigh are responsible for all actions of all 350,000 civil servants every day and everywhere.  I had therefore better not say that I am not responsible.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">It is not about that, as I will try to explain.  The Deputy will be familiar with good customer service and the various subgroups in the Departments, each of which has a departmental charter.  Civil servants are meant to spend a set amount of time dealing with queries regarding what they do and how they deal and communicate with the public.  That work is done well.  The Revenue Commissioners and social welfare offices have been the two sectors to take a lead and drive on work with other Departments.  Independent customer surveys have produced extraordinary figures for public satisfaction regarding Departments' service.  Not everywhere is that good, but they are doing well.  The general view on that end of the work is that they must keep at it.  That is ongoing, with two committees working on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">The OECD review is not simply another report on the public service but the first comprehensive review of it as a system in this country.  The concept is of a holistic, wide-ranging assessment that will identify many different things.  It has been explained to me in discussions with those involved that no experts have been engaged in Ireland and that OECD staff conduct this work in different countries themselves.  They have produced reports on various issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">The first of two main elements they attempt to gauge is how the Irish public service compares with those recognised in OECD countries as following good practice in aspects of public management.  That uses the unique insights of the OECD in the field, since it covers all those member countries and knows the models and plans.  The organisation benchmarks the best.  It compares our systems and processes with the best models.  Its staff come here and engage with our Secretaries General and a committee of assistant secretaries from the different Departments.  That first process has already commenced, with several meetings held in recent months.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">The second element is how the various parts of our system relate to each other, a major issue dating back to the Public Service Management Act 1997.  They cannot be independent fiefdoms but must co-ordinate with each other.  The OECD scrutinises the relationship between central and local government and how Departments translate objectives into actions, whether the field be health or local government.  In particular, it examines health and education to see if there are better ways in which common issues can be addressed.  When I undertook the review, I asked it to give me two examples, which turned out to be child care and social inclusion, both of them split between many different Departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">That is the purpose of the review, and the senior levels of the Civil Service believe that it will help.  They are satisfied with what they did in the public service reform 20 years ago and the Public Service Management Act 1997.  They now believe that this is the next level.  It would be beneficial to examine how the systems relate to each other.  In my view, one works for the public service rather than for Department A or B.  I hope that simplifies matters for the Deputy.</p>

He said, however, that we should be prepared to take hard decisions which the reforms will require.  What stark message does the Taoiseach expect to arise from the OECD review?  For example, does he expect criticism of public service pay and conditions, or will the report be used as an excuse to impose stricter limits on numbers employed in the public service?  Is the Taoiseach aware that an embargo on recruiting new staff means we do not have enough ambulance crews?  I came across such an example recently in my own constituency.</p>

The Taoiseach referred to joined-up thinking on the public service, but will this review cover joined-up Government?  We regularly criticise the education and health sectors where one section clearly does not seem to know what the other is doing.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_182">The review is not a substantive audit of sectors, such as health, education and local government.  It is, rather, focusing on the connectivity between various sectors, as I told Deputy Rabbitte, including central and wider sectoral areas.  It is examining the effectiveness of arrangements through which Government objectives are translated into outputs and outcomes by means of collaboration by different parts of the system.  My Government's polices and strategies in various sectors, such as health, education and local government, will continue in parallel with the review.  Every day work continues involving our 350,000 public servants but naturally there are lessons to be learned from the review.  Where sensible improvements and refinements to our ongoing work on reforming these sectors are recommended, they will be fed into the overall mix.  It is not a pay review and the OECD would have no part in such a review.  As I have already said, the review is an holistic, system-wide assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">There is also a peer review element in the exercise whereby senior officials and practitioners from countries actively involved — both as part of the fact-finding and drafting teams, and as members of committees — will review the draft report.  It is valuable because it will help towards sharing best practice from other countries.  It will also provide an element of rigour in the process of framing recommendations in practical terms.  Against this background, it was considered that the OCED is best placed to undertake a review of this nature.  Similar reviews by the OECD in the economic and regulatory areas were well established and rightly regarded as instruments here.  The OECD's public governance and territorial development committee has also established similar peer review processes in other areas, including human resource management, information and communication technology, and ethics in the public service.  Any private sector consultancy would struggle to match the OECD in such terms because of its vast experience of peer review benefits, in-house expertise, knowledge and networking to communities of interest among EU member states and further afield.</p>

Is one feeding into the other or are parallel reviews taking place?  I would like to check the relationship of one with the other.  Has the OECD been given any remit to examine decentralisation and how it affects the issue of public service quality?  Does the OECD have a mandate to address the embargo on staff recruitment, given Mr. Paul Appleby's problems concerning corporate governance and the lack of staff available to him for that vital work?  Does the OECD have a mandate to make recommendations in that regard?  What will be done about the recommendations?  Will we receive a report on how they are being implemented or will anything be done about them?</p>

          <p eId="para_185">Account will be taken of the NESF report and any other previous work, which will feed into the OECD's work.  In the first instance, the OECD is consulting with the high-level steering group which is at Secretary General level.  That group, comprising Secretaries General across Departments, including the Revenue Commissioners, has been set up to oversee the review.  The driving force behind decisions made in this respect will be the Secretaries General.  The liaison group is at assistant secretary level and was established to support the OECD team that will be undertaking field work here.  There will also be an open process whereby members of the public and interested parties can convey their views, including through web-based means, which is what the OECD does with all its reviews.  I understand that the high-level steering group is considering a targeted consultation with identified stakeholders, including the social partners, Members of the Oireachtas, senior officials and parties with an interest in public service issues.  Those views will be conveyed to the OECD, so the NESF report will obviously fit into that.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The review is being chaired by the Secretary General to the Government.  Membership of the steering group comprises representatives from the Department of Finance's public service management and development section, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Education and Science and Health and Children.  The steering group also comprises key public servants, including the Garda Commissioner, the chairman of the County and City Managers Association, the chairman of the Association of Chief Executives of State Agencies and the head of the education department in NUI Maynooth.  As I have said, the high-level steering group is being assisted in its work by a group at assistant secretary level.  That group is chaired by an assistant secretary of my own Department.  It includes most of the major Departments as well as the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">There is a consultative dimension to the review process which will draw on expertise from the business, academic and community sectors, as well as the social partners and other stakeholders.  It is a small group comprising an important team.  It began its work just after the Christmas break and plans to complete its endeavours by next Christmas, following which the report will be presented.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">If the group has views on practices in any of these areas it can provide them in the report.  There will be no restrictions and there is nothing to stop the group giving its views on embargos or other matters.  The Deputy asked about Mr. Appleby who is in the process of getting additional staff.  He has 36 staff at present and is getting additional numbers.  The reason he is not getting them all is that we made a priority in that Department to put the staff into new inspection sectors dealing with compliance by workers.  The number of inspectors has risen from 30 to 90.  It rose to 60 last year and 90 this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">We have set up a whole new division and it is a matter of priorities — it is not that Mr. Appleby's work is not considered important.  He already has 36 staff, he is getting four this year and it is hoped he will receive another four.  It is a question of prioritising the placement of staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_1216">Appointments to boards are made on the basis of the knowledge, expertise and experience individuals can bring to a board.  In many cases appointments are made on the basis of nominations by relevant groups, such as social partners, and the individuals involved agree to serve out of a sense of public duty rather than monetary considerations.  In most boards there are no monetary considerations.  It is not recommended that people with problems or difficulties like those outlined by the Deputy serve on boards, although it depends on the nature of the difficulty.  Most people in society are affected by minor issues but if it was a major tax issue the person would be ruled out.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">Most boards are composed of members put forward by nominating bodies and such bodies tend to be careful about nominating people with difficulties, although it happens from time to time.  Most of the time this is not an issue.</p>

He said "I appointed them because they were friends, not because of anything they had given me".  Has the Taoiseach changed his view in this regard and does he still have friends who have not yet been appointed to something?</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">I will frame my contribution in the interrogative, in case the Ceann Comhairle feels compelled to jump in.  Is it not wrong to give the impression that the Taoiseach only makes appointments to the relatively harmless boards he has listed here?

        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_1282">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">I am grateful for the opportunity to bring this Bill to the House.  It has already had the benefit of a detailed debate in the Seanad and I know it will receive the same attention in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">In the 2004 White Paper, Regulating Better, the Government committed to improving the transparency and accessibility of legislation on the Statute Book.  As part of that process, a statute law revision project was initiated, under the aegis of the Office of the Attorney General, to identify and remove all outdated and obsolete legislation that predates the foundation of the State.  The first step in this project, the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005, which was enacted in December 2005, removed 206 obsolete Acts from the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">The Statute Law Revision Bill 2007 is the second phase of this project aimed at removing all unnecessary legislation from before 6 December 1922 from our Statute Book.  However, the provisions of this Bill are radically different from revision Bills previously published in this State.  Whereas previous revision Bills simply listed the legislation they proposed to repeal, this Bill approaches the process of repeal from a different viewpoint.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">The Bill has two main objectives.  First, it positively states those laws that predate 6 December 1922 which will remain in effect after enactment of the Bill.  Second, it repeals all other legislation from this pre-independence period not positively mentioned as being listed for retention.  For ease of reference, Schedule 2 sets out the legislation being repealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">The sum effect of the main provisions of this Bill is to provide for the repeal of 3,188 Acts or statutes that date from the period between 1204 and 1922.  It is the most significant statute law revision measure ever undertaken.  The Bill provides for the repeal of more public and general statutes than were enacted by the Oireachtas since 1922.  It also provides for the positive retention, pending further review, of 1,348 Acts that may be of ongoing relevance.  Ultimately, these 1,348 Acts will also be repealed and, where necessary, re-enacted in modern form.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">As with the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005, this Bill is intended substantially to streamline the Statute Book by eliminating those remaining pre-independence statutes that have no relevance whatsoever to modern conditions.  The Bill also contains significant provisions to streamline the rules relating to the production in court of copies of the pre-independence statutes that may still be of relevance and therefore must be retained for the time being.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">Before outlining the main substance of the Bill, I will outline to the House the wider better regulation context to which this Bill relates. Since publication of the White Paper, Regulating Better, in January 2004, the Taoiseach has vigorously pursued the better regulation agenda.  This Bill represents further delivery of a key commitment in that White Paper to modernise and streamline the Statute Book and to ensure that all legislation in force in the State is accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">At the core of the better regulation programme is the view that we must address both the flow of new legislation and also the existing stock of legislation.  The flow of new regulations is primarily being tackled through regulatory impact analysis, which was introduced across all Departments in June 2005.  This approach requires Departments to consult more widely before regulating and to analyse in greater detail the likely impacts of Acts and significant statutory instruments before presenting them to the Oireachtas.  In this way, proposed legislation will benefit from being subject to comment by interested parties and will be more comprehensively evaluated in terms of potential downstream impacts.  In the longer term, this process should lead to the drafting of better quality regulation that does not negatively impact on other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">Clearly, while we are working to improve the quality of legislation that is coming on stream, we simultaneously must tackle the substantial body of existing laws and regulations and this is where today's Bill fits in.  Statute law revision is the process of removing the dead wood from the system, removing legislation that is obsolete or has lost any modern purpose.  As even a cursory examination of the Schedules to the Bill shows, some of the legislation that remains on our Statute Book dates back to William the Conqueror.  It is clear that removing such archaic, obsolete legislation provides greater clarity to citizens on the legislation that remains in force and removes a significant legislative burden from the economy and society as whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">The overall objective is to provide the people with a single, clear and accessible legislative code that will contain only laws enacted by the democratically elected Oireachtas or under European law, where Ireland is a proud member of equal nations.  This Bill will be a major step along the road towards clarity and democratic credibility in our Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">The Bill deals with over 4,500 statutes dating from between 1070 and December 1922.  Various different Parliaments legislated in respect of Ireland during these centuries, including Norman and English colonial Parliaments sitting in Ireland during the first centuries after the Norman invasion but legislating only for the parts of Ireland they controlled.  Latter Anglo-Irish Parliaments legislated for the whole island before 1800, English and British Parliaments legislated for Ireland despite the existence of those Anglo-Irish Parliaments and United Kingdom Parliaments legislated for Ireland and Britain after the Act of Union of 1800.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">Article 73 of the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann and Article 50 of the Constitution of Ireland provided for the continuation in force of the general body of such statute law enacted prior to 6 December 1922.  This proliferation of Legislatures that passed laws pertaining to Ireland has led to a situation where there is uncertainty about precisely which laws still apply to Ireland.  This Bill will eliminate that uncertainty.  For the first time ever, Irish citizens will know for certain what laws apply to them.  This must be seen as an important and welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">In the interest of establishing precisely which laws from before the foundation of the State still apply to Ireland, officials in the Office of the Attorney General have worked over the past two years to identify and record all legislation passed by the various Parliaments which had authority over Ireland.  At present, these records comprise approximately 60,000 examples of pre-independence primary legislation, of which about 26,700 are public and general statutes and about 33,300 are private statues or local and personal statutes; approximately 3,000 are post-independence Acts of the Oireachtas; and approximately 20,000 are secondary legislation from the period before and after independence, including charters, orders and statutory instruments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">The phase of the statute law revision project that has resulted in the Bill before us today relates solely to the research and analysis conducted on the 26,700 pre-independence public and general statutes.  The first phase of the analysis involved ascertaining which of these 26,700 statutes applied to Ireland and are still in force.  Approximately 4,500 were found to be in that category and the remainder were found either never to have applied to Ireland or to have been repealed.  These 4,500 statutes were then examined in greater detail to see which of them had any modern relevance.  Initial assessments were made by the legal researchers in the Office of the Attorney General as to which statutes might still have some modern relevance and which were obsolete and could therefore be repealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">After that initial assessment was made, detailed and extensive consultations were held with the relevant Departments and State agencies so that Departments could specifically approve or reject the inclusion of an Act or statute listed for repeal.  The public was also invited throughout 2006 to inspect the various lists of the statutes proposed for repeal and retention, which were made available through the website of the Office of the Attorney General.  Over 150 submissions were received from outside bodies and interested individuals on these lists and all of these helped shape the Bill that is before us today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">Where any doubt has arisen as to the suitability of an Act or a statute for repeal, or if there is any possibility that any one of the pre-independence Acts could still be relevant today, then that Act is being retained in force and is listed in Schedule 1 of the Bill.  As I have indicated, these Acts will be repealed in due course but this must be done by way of substantial law reform measures; it would not be appropriate to repeal them in a Statute Law Revision Bill.   That process of statute law reform is already under way and more than 12% of the statutes listed for retention in Schedule 1 are already proposed for repeal in other legislation currently before the Oireachtas in the current Dáil session.  That process will continue until we reach a position when all of the statutes now in Schedule 1 will be repealed and replaced with modern legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">In tandem with that process, further measures will be put in place to deal with local and personal statutes, private statutes, post-independence legislation and secondary legislation, and these measure will ultimately come before this House by way of similar legislation to the Bill which is before the Dail today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">I will now explain to the House the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides a broad definition of the word "statute".  This means that the Bill will not only deal with Acts of Parliament as we would recognise them today, but will also include royal ordinances and similar documents that are recognised as having equivalent force and effect to an Act of Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">Section 2 is the main provision of the Bill.  It will provide a fundamental clarification and simplification of the Statute Book by repealing all statutes enacted before 6 December 1922 with the exception of those statutes that are specifically preserved.  This includes the 1,348 statutes listed in Schedule 1, which have or may have some modern relevance.  These cannot be repealed until they are first replaced by modern legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">The other main category of exceptions are local and personal statutes and private statutes.  These are statutes enacted and-or published under different mechanisms from the normal.  These categories relate to particular places, people or companies rather than to the community in general.  For that reason, there are sound legal and logistical reasons to deal with public and general statutes first in the current Bill and return to private, local and personal statutes in later legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">Section 2(3) of the Bill has the effect of repealing a part of the Bill of Rights of 1688.  This is the only case where an Act is proposed for a partial repeal rather than being repealed entirely.  The Bill of Rights may have continuing relevance to parliamentary privilege but certain provisions contain inappropriate religious discrimination and these are being repealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">Section 3 of the Bill provides for the listing in Schedule 2 of the 3,188 statutes being repealed by the Bill.  These are the public general statutes which applied to Ireland, have never previously been repealed and do not have any continuing relevance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">Sections 4 to 7, inclusive, relate to Short Titles.  A number of the Acts listed in Schedule 1 do not currently have a Short Title and the Bill provides for one to be assigned to them.  The Bill also amends certain existing Short Titles of Acts which are currently unconventional or misleading.  The effect of this Bill will be to standardise the Short Titles of all surviving statutes listed in Schedule 1.  This will facilitate and simplify the making of references to those Acts in court and in future amending or reforming legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">Section 8 provides that copies produced in certain official publications, or copies from publications as certified by the National Library or other specified institutions, may be produced in court.  The original versions of many of the ancient Acts have been lost over the years, but copies of these Acts have been published in certain reliable publications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">Section 9 is a savings clause, which is standard for Bills of this type, with some additional provisions.  The savings clause is designed to ensure that there are no unintended consequences arising from the repeals effected by the Bill.  Section 10 provides for a Short Title and collective citation of the Short Titles Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">Schedule 1 lists the 1,348 statutes that are being retained and Schedule 2 lists the 3,188 statutes that, because they are not being retained, are, as a consequence, repealed.  The Bill is an historic step toward presenting the State with a modern and coherent Statute Book.  It will, for the first time in our history, allow us to know for certain what laws apply here.  It will remove more than 3,000 laws dating from 1070 to 1922 which remain on our Statute Book despite having no modern relevance.  In the interests of legal certainty and democratic legitimacy, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">It had a comfortable and interesting passage through the other House.  As I did there, I again commend and thank all the officials in the Office of the Attorney General who have done tremendous work on the Bill.  We had a great team of young researchers.  The Acts listed in Schedules 1 and 2 contain some fascinating historical information, which could usefully be researched by students.  I have encouraged the establishment of a process that would allow young students to delve through this fascinating information.  It was a privilege to steer the Bill through the other House and I hope it will have a comfortable passage through this one.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1310">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Much of this legislation predates even the Minister of State.  I stayed up all night going through the Bill and considering the legislation that had been passed before 1922.  When I first came to this House, little did I expect to speak about Her Majesty's Treasurer, Henry VIII, Henry V, King Edward, King John and many others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">The Fine Gael Party supports the Statute Law Revision Bill and other initiatives of this kind.  An extraordinary number of Acts that predate the establishment of the State still have legal effect here.  The size of the Schedules to the Bill is testament to that fact.  The Minister of State outlined his admiration for the researchers, with which I concur.  I put on the record my support and admiration for the officials and staff of the Office of the Attorney General who have dedicated themselves to this initiative over several years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">Among the Acts listed in the Bill are the Site for Schoolrooms Act 1836, the Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840, the Portumna Bridge 1858 Act — providing for the abolition of tolls and its maintenance — the Margarine Act 1887 and the Lunacy Act 1891.  Seeing mention of the Lunacy Act made me think we should bring it back into this House and update it because there has been a lot of that happening over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">On reading the Bill, I was astounded that 26,370 Acts had entered into force prior to the establishment of the State.  We should be moving towards a situation where all the statutes in force in the Republic of Ireland have been enacted since 1922.  I can imagine the people involved in drafting these Bills in smoky rooms with bad light.  What we are discussing is really historical.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">Several important statutes, particularly from the 19th century, should be re-enacted and revised for modern consumption, including the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 and the General Prisons (Ireland) Act 1877.  In excess of 1,000 statutes will remain in force and have not been included on the list.  The volume of statutes that have been adjudged necessary for retention is extraordinary.  Hundreds of pre-1922 statutes from the Dublin Fair Act 1252 to the Constabulary and Police (Ireland) Act 1919 have been deemed to be worthy or necessary of retention and not repeal.  What could possibly be contained in these Acts that is not in legislation enacted since 1922?</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">I am particularly surprised at the retention of Acts that pertain to areas that have recently undergone considerable revision in this House.  For example, I note that the Bill does not repeal the following Acts concerning road traffic legislation: the Kinsale Act 1819; the Howth and Holyhead Harbours Act 1823; Kingstown Township (Transfer of Harbour Roads) Act 1898; and the Roads Act 1920.  I do not expect the Minister of State or his officials to know all these off by heart.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomKitt" eId="spk_214" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_1316">The Deputy has been working hard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1317">I have been working very hard; as I said, I was up all night.  Surely in the 15 road traffic and related Acts that have been passed by this Government and its predecessor since 1997, there was room somewhere to repeal an Act that referred to a place in Ireland that does not even exist anymore — I refer to Kingstown.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">Similarly, this House passed the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 last November.  Notwithstanding its substantial reforms of the land law in Ireland and the mechanisms surrounding conveyancing and land registration, that legislation made no mention of repeal of the following Acts: the Drainage and Improvement of Lands Supplemental Act (Ireland) 1867; the Christ Church Lands Act 1481; the Plus Lands Act 1703; the Timber Act 1735; the Harcourt Street Act 1777 providing power to the Archbishop of Dublin to let lands for building; the King's Inns Act 1798; the Crown Lands (Ireland) Acts 1822 and 1845; and the Leasing Powers for Religious Worship in Ireland Act 1855.  We still come across disputes over the ownership of and rights to land.  I have no doubt such disputes will continue for many years.  The Property Registration Authority often needs to consider Acts that predate 1922.  It is great to bring such legislation up to date.  This is just a selection of the many land-related acts that will not be repealed by this Bill.  If not today, perhaps on Committee Stage, the Minister of State might explain what these Acts contain that is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">I do not underestimate the task faced by the Minister of State and his researchers in the Office of the Attorney General regarding assessing the potential relevance of historical Acts and statutes to modern Ireland.  It is a mammoth area, but it seems to me that there is much more to be done.  Fine Gael in the next Government will bring such legislation up to date and will continue what has been started with this Bill.  This is an important process for a number of reasons.  It is a responsibility of a modern democracy to ensure that its Statute Book and its collection of laws are modern, just and up to date.  Those that are not should be cleaned out and reformed.  This is particularly clear when we look at the use of words in some of the Acts that pre-date the establishment of the State.  The Lunatics Act, the legislation on the prohibition on taking horses of freemen for transport work and the legislation providing free hostelry for Knights of St. John, while all historically interesting, bear no relevance to modern times or modern attitudes.  Reference is made to the King's wardships and marriages to be sold for his profit in 1331.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">More importantly, we now have a very effective and efficient Statute Book that is available on-line to anyone who wants to access it.  In his closing remarks, the Minister of State referred to schoolchildren.  It would be great for schoolchildren to know what happened prior to 1922.  When I was going to school I did not appreciate the history I learned.  It is only afterwards that one appreciates our historical documents.  That a considerable number of historical documents were destroyed in the Four Courts when it was burned is soul destroying.  Major work and effort has to go into updating what was enacted, all because 90% of our records were destroyed in the Four Courts.  I appreciate a great deal of work has been taking place behind the scenes and it is important that continues.  This is a resource that is of great use to practitioners, academics, members of the Judiciary and Irish citizens.  The Office of the Attorney General deserves credit for putting it on-line and for maintaining and keeping it up to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">However, it is a database of post-1922 statutes, so anyone who wishes to consult legislation that still has legal effect but was passed prior to 6 December 1922, has no way of accessing electronic copies of those statutes.  Perhaps the Minister would examine that issue with a view to ascertaining if this can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">Surely, we should be moving towards a stage where all applicable law is easily available to all citizens.  The Fine Gael Party supports this Bill, having discussed it at our front bench meeting on Tuesday morning.  In the next Government we will endeavour to ensure it is brought up to date.  This is something Deputy Jim O'Keeffe would wish to see progressed.  I hope this Bill and its successors are a step down that road and I offer the support of the Fine Gael Party in that respect; I hope it has an easy passage through the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EmmetStagg" eId="spk_216">
          <from>Mr. Stagg</from>
          <p eId="para_1323">Unlike my Fine Gael colleague I did not sit up all night burning the midnight oil on this issue.  However, I wish to acknowledge the assistance given to me in this matter by the Labour Party legal adviser, Mr. Finbar O'Malley, in researching the area and in helping me to construct a sensible speech on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">This Bill is undoubtedly welcome.  It breaks the back of a task that has been poorly attended to for decades and those responsible for knuckling down to the job and producing this end result deserve our thanks.  It is important to realise that this is only the start of the job and a great deal of work remains to be done.  It could be said "a lot done and more to do".</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">As the Bill's Long Title makes clear, the concentration here is on repealing pre-lndependence Acts that have either ceased to have effect or have become unnecessary.  More than 26,000 Acts were examined for this exercise and it turned out that more than 9,000 had already been wholly repealed.  In addition, another 12,500 or so had never applied to Ireland.  This left 4,536 statutes still in force here, at least notionally, of which 3,188 will be repealed by this Bill.  Significantly, that means there will be another 1,348 Acts remaining on our Statute Book which were not passed by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">On the plus side, at least those 1,348 Acts have been specifically identified and, for what it is worth, have each been given a Short Title.  On the minus side, although we will continue these Acts in force, we have never felt obliged to publish any of them and the State seems unlikely to take on such an obligation at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">It is said that the ancient Roman emperor and tyrant Caligula had his laws written in small script and then posted in the Forum upon high pillars "the better to ensnare the populace".  We go one better than Caligula.  We do not bother to post our old laws at all.  They are all out of print.  It is not as if those old laws just rest there inert and decaying.  They are applied and enforced.  Then we make life even more difficult by amending them.  We add, subtract, extend and qualify.  But, while we publish and debate amendments, we do not publish either the original laws we are amending or those laws as amended.  The public is left to guess what the end result may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">As an example of what I am talking about, my colleague Deputy Upton recently needed to check up on laws relating to cruelty to animals.  In her efforts to find out what is the law at present in force and where one can get a copy of it, she started with the Protection of Animals Act 1911.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">The Department of Agriculture and Food indicated that it does not provide copies of the legislation and refers such queries to the Government Publications Sales Office.  The Government Publications Sales Office indicated that it refers customers seeking pre-1922 legislation to Her Majesty's Stationery Office in Belfast.  Her Majesty's Stationery Office in Belfast confirm that paper copies of the 1911 Act can be ordered by credit card or sterling draft at £2.85.  Requests will be processed in three to four days working days.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">The help desk which operates the Statute Book in the Attorney General's Office was able to confirm that requests for pre-1922 statutes fall into the top five of its list of requests for help.  The on-line Statute Book will tell one, if one is an experienced user, whether and where a pre-1922 Act has been amended but it will not disclose what the original Act looked like before it was amended or, therefore, what it looks like now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">One will find out, for example, that some changes were made to the 1911 Act by the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act in 1965, by the Wildlife Act in 1976, by the Control of Dogs Act in 1986, by  the Abattoirs Act in 1988 and by the Control of Horses Act in 1996.  But changes to what?  One has no way of finding out.  The conclusion is that, unless one belongs to a law library or has access to on-line electronic resources, one will not see a copy of the original 1911 legislation.  What is worse, even if one does have a copy of that Act, one will then need — with a scrapbook, scissors and paste — to assemble together a facsimile of what the law looks like now by including one by one, all the amendments subsequently made to that law.  If one is privileged enough to be a Member of this House, one will have the efficient and professional resources of our Library and research staff to do that job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">It is surely unacceptable that legislation which is enforced on a daily basis should be so difficult to track down for so many of those affected by it.  It is incredible that the Oireachtas could at least five times in 50 years have made major amendments to a piece of primary legislation like this without imposing on anyone the obligation to promulgate the law as so amended.  It is even worse when those amendments are not made by the Oireachtas but instead are made under ministerial regulations.  That has a devastating effect on the integrity of our legal system because it becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to know with certainty what actually is the primary law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">The Attorney General and his officials should commit themselves in future, whenever a new Bill involves amendments to legislation that is out of print, to restating in full the law as amended rather than just setting out the amendments.  Reading a statute should not be like reading a tortuous detective story, with clues scattered around, some of them misleading, but leading the assiduous to an eventual denouement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">This is, as I have said, the first stage of an ongoing project.  We have a list of 1,348 Acts that remain in force. The next stage is to make those Acts available, preferably electronically.  There is surely scope here for an all-Ireland approach since, for most of our history, we have shared a common Statute Book.  The final stage is to consolidate laws in force so that cross-referencing between decades and even centuries to track down amendments and substitutions becomes a thing of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">The Government places a great deal of reliance on the statute law restatement procedure as a means of codifying the Statute Book.  Instead of steering consolidation Bills through the Oireachtas, the work can be done and published on an administrative basis.  The answer given by the Taoiseach to my colleague Deputy Quinn on 13 February 2007 seems to show that the work is going backwards.  Deputy Quinn asked the Taoiseach the number of statute law restatements prepared and published to date by the Office of the Attorney General under the Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002.  He was told that the Office of the Attorney General has managed to publish just four restatements under that procedure since it became law in 2002.  Significantly, it had prepared drafts of further restatements.  The office stated that "however, due to pending amending legislation and other reasons, the draft restatements were not brought to certification stage".</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">It seems we in this House, or more accurately, the Government and its Parliamentary Counsel, are busier doing damage to the coherence and accessibility of the Statute Book than another section in the Office of the Attorney General is in trying to repair that damage by putting it together again.  The reason they do damage is entirely down to the method of law-making they adopt.  It is as if they do not want anyone to know what their laws are about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">For example, let us look at the current Education Bill.  Instead of stating or re-stating what principles and rules should apply, it contains sections headed "amendment of section 2 of Act of 1998", "amendment of section 13 of Act of 1998", "amendment of section 53 of Act of 1998" and so on.  There is no reason why we should legislate like that.  All we are doing is making more work for the statute law restatement officials and making it inevitable that they will never catch up with the damage we do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">It is worth pointing out that the original Consolidation Bill procedure was not a product of legislation but is a product of our Standing Orders.  I suggest one new amendment be made to our Standing Orders that might assist in bringing coherence to our laws.  Where a Bill is introduced that consists entirely or mostly of amendments to existing statute law, it should be published and debated on Second and Committee Stages in the normal way.  There should then be an instruction to the committee that it reports back to the House with a Bill consisting of the old Act as proposed to be amended by the new Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">The House would then have a consolidation measure, certified by the Attorney General as such, in front of it.  Debate on Report Stage would be confined to the matters that were dealt with in committee, that is, the proposed amendments to the law, but the existing statute law would not be re-opened for debate.  It seems that measures like this must be seriously considered rather than leaving it to the restatement officials to catch up with the Legislature.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">For good measure, the officials have prepared not only a list of Acts we will retain but also a list of those Acts they can identify which will be repealed.  They do not claim to have identified them all, but if a statute is not on the retained list or the repealed list, it will by default be repealed.  I am slightly perplexed by some of the Acts being repealed, but no doubt, the Minister will be able to provide some elaboration when he replies on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">If it is not thought necessary specifically to repeal Acts which clearly never applied to Ireland, why, for example, are we repealing the Local Government (Scotland) Act, the Sheriffs Court (Scotland) Act, the Trusts (Scotland) Act, the Welsh Church Act and so on?  Why are we repealing the Poisons and Pharmacy Act 1908, only two sections of which ever applied to Ireland and which were repealed by the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1961?  If pre-independence Acts remain in force only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with our Constitution, why do we think it necessary to repeal Acts dealing with titles deprivation, the regency of the Crown, the demise of the Crown, the pensions of dominion governors and the Civil List?</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">One could also ask questions about the Acts being retained in force.  I would be interested to know, for example, how the Bill of Rights 1688, which pre-dates English union with Scotland, let alone Ireland, but which post-dates Poyning's Law, comes to form part of the Irish Statute Book and why it is being retained in force.  Is the Attorney General really arguing that since independence, proceedings in this House have been and will continue to be governed by the English Parliamentary Privilege Act of 1603 rather than by the provisions of the Constitution that deal with parliamentary privilege?</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">The fact that we are retaining an Act to give effect to the peace treaty with Hungary signed at Trianon in 1921 raises a question as to whether this treaty remains in force, whether this State is bound by it and how many other pre-independence treaties might remain in force.  On the domestic level, the Oireachtas will in future know how many statutes from before 1922 are in force.  However, at the international level, does the Department of Foreign Affairs have a similar list of treaties that bind us as a successor state to the former United Kingdom?</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">There are other issues raised in the Bill that ought to have been settled long ago.  Can it really be the case, for example, that there may still be extant orders made under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922?  If there are, they relate to the ultimate transfer of functions from the British administration in Ireland to the Provisional Government and then to the Free State Executive Council and its Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">Some of the possibly excessive powers and privileges claimed by the Department of Finance in its dealings with other Departments of State are thought to date from the terms of these old transfer of functions orders.  If that is the sole basis for its behaviour, which is not always favourable, it is frail enough.  These orders are not published by the Attorney General, but he must know whether any of them are extant.  Why not list and publish them?</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">Ultimately, our agreed commitment must be to make legislation more coherent and more easily accessible to those who need it.  As part of this process, the Labour Party welcomes this Bill and will give it constructive consideration on Second and Committee Stages.</p>

          <p eId="para_1349">The Green Party supports this attempt to rationalise the Irish Statute Book.  It is unfortunate that the debate we are having is truncated to the extent that due to the scale of the legal instruments before us it would, at least on Committee Stage, warrant more attention than it has been given to date.  We are talking about thousands of legal instruments.  We must take it on trust that the deletion of 3,000 or so statutes as a result of this Bill will not leave a hole in the Statute Book and that they represent legislation that has been properly adopted since the foundation of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">I would like to see more detail in the Bill in respect of the 1,348 remaining statutes.  The Schedule is 20 times longer than the Bill.  While an attempt has been made to represent each of these Bills in some type of graphic form, I do not really need to know the year, session and chapter in which these Bills were passed.  The subject matter is certainly a help, but I need to know the extent to which these Bills need to be retained in the Irish Statute Book because there is no explanation whatsoever there.  As has already been mentioned, the inclusion of some of these Bills seems curious, to say the least.  They include the early statutes from the time of Richard, Duke of York, to have fairs and markets in Ratoath and the legislation ensuring that Carrick-on-Suir in Tipperary is not burnt by rebels.  Is the Government saying that somehow there might be a repetition of these events in the near future or that it would like to have this legislation on the Statute Book just in case they occur?  Another example of such legislation is one concerning the pardon of fee farm and grant of custom and cocket of the City of Cork to the mayor and commons there.  Having been a member of Cork Corporation, which is now Cork City Council, I never knew I had the grant of custom and cocket and would certainly like to know what it is.  Somehow, the Government seems to think this legislation is worth retaining.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">More sinister perhaps is the retention of the Parliamentary Privilege Act of 1471, which concerns freedom from arrest of Members of the House of Lords coming to Parliament, and their servants, and the Servant of the Prior of the Hospital to be released.  I hope the Servant to the Prior of the Hospital has been released by now given it is 500 years later.  Somehow, someone has decided that this legislation needs to be incorporated in the Irish Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">A law from the 15th century has also been retained.  The Courts Act of 1476 requires lords to wear their robes in Parliament and judges and barons to wear their habits and coifs in term time.  I do not know if the Government is thinking of dressing up Members of this House, but, again, I find it curious that this legislation needs to be retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">Some of the Bills seem to talk about areas one thought would already have been talked about by legislation passed since the foundation of this State in 1922.  There is legislation about the foundation of hospitals that are no longer in existence, for example, Mercer's Hospital in Dublin and Cork Infirmary.  I would have liked a more detailed explanation as to why there is a need to retain these items of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">From a purely constituency viewpoint, I note there were several items of legislation before the Act of Union such as the City of Cork (Improvement) Act, which I still think is a good idea.  It appears to have been one of the last items of legislation passed by the old Irish Parliament before the Act of Union in 1801.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">There is a curious item of legislation from the period after 1800 which the Government wants to retain, namely, the Portumna Bridge Act, relating to the removal of tolls and the taking in charge of that bill for public improvements.  Perhaps the only reason this legislation is retained is because the Government considers it might have some application in terms of buying out the West Link toll bridge.  Given that it was done in the middle of the 19th century, perhaps the Government would learn something from a previous Government about how a toll bridge can be taken out of existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">The real problem with the proposed legislation relates not so much to the listing of outdated statutes or even the retention of some legislative items that appear to maintain some type of relevance for the legal code, but to the lack of any kind of intention from the Government to replace the retained 1,348 items of statute.  I would like to see a timetable from the Government stating how it intends to replace all these statutes by new legislation.  Is it possible to do this in an all-embracing Bill such as this purports to be or does it need to be done by way of individual items of legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">It is curious the Government has referred in its legislative programme to the replacement of some Acts on the list that are being retained.  Reference to a Curragh of Kildare Bill was a constant feature of the programme in recent years, prior to this year, but the Government has decided to retain the Curragh of Kildare Act dating from the mid-19th century.  There are many inconsistencies in the listing being supplied to Members of the House.  I regret the information supplied with the draft of the Bill is insufficient.  We do not have adequate time to give a proper inspection of the proposed legislation.  That said, and all frivolity aside, there is no doubt this is a necessary exercise, one which we would probably need to repeat on a regular basis — perhaps every five or ten years.  It would require a great deal of work from the Attorney General's office to keep us up to speed in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">A possible way of circumventing the lack of examination afforded to this Bill is to convene a standing committee of the House, in the same way as we have a Joint Committee on European Affairs to consider the thousands of statutes emerging every year from the European Union, and to try to incorporate them into Irish law, despite the near passage of the European Communities Act which appears to be an attempt by the Government to subvert that process.  It would be valuable work for a standing committee of the House to examine legislation that has become outdated and reincorporate it into modern legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">The Green Party will not oppose the Bill but we hope much of what has been said in the debate will be taken on board in future legislation in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_1360">It is interesting that it has taken so long for us to get to this stage.  I would have presumed this would have been one of the first items on the agenda either in 1922 or 1948, to repeal British or English Acts and to replace them with parliamentary legislation agreed by the representatives of this State.  Great work is finally being done in this attempt to repeal a number of statutes which have been used or abused over the years because they remained in existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">As the Bill progresses, we need an explanation and a timetable in regard to the 1,348 Acts which will remain.  Like other Deputies, I find it strange that some statutes will remain on the Statute Book.  We need an explanation as to why that is the case, a timetable for when we will replace them and proposals for legislation to overwrite and update some of these statutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">It is interesting to go through the list of legislation, some of it dating back several hundreds of years, and to read the subject matter relating to various Acts.  It is probably more interesting again to go through each individual Act.  I expect those involved in drafting the legislation had great fun.  While we can be frivolous about some of the legislation we propose to repeal or remove from the Statute Book, I question the merit of some of the legislation that remains in place.  I hope this work will continue in future years beyond the Statute Law Revision Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">One of the remaining anomalous Acts relates to the erection of castles and fortifications in Dublin or the establishment of fairs in Donnybrook — it is a long time since there was a fair in Donnybrook, whatever about Waterford city or Limerick city.  The Act is to be renamed from the Fairs Act 1204.  A number of Acts are being retained which relate to fairs and markets.  It would be a major job in itself to amalgamate all such legislation into a single Act which would give standard rulings on fairs and markets around Ireland and would also continue the privileges which have been granted at various stages down through the years that have become common practice since.  It would be a considerable undertaking to deal with grants of licences etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">Another anomaly is the Taking of Pledges Act.  The taking of pledges contrary to the common law was considered a felony.  That law dates to 1475 and at this stage, democracy has overtaken this requirement, bar in the Six Counties where people are still being asked to make pledges to the Queen and the like.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">The Bog of Allen Act 1478 related to freedom to draw turf from the bog.  I thought environmental concerns and subsequent legislation to give licences to Bord na Móna and local people to cut turf would have invalidated this Act.  The Marriage (No. 2) Act 1537 remains in place.  Likewise, I presumed laws enacted since the foundation of the State would have superseded this.  I would be interested to hear the reason it remains on the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">I question the need to retain legislation relating to sheriffs, the sale of horses etc.  While sheriffs are still part of society,  we need to update and modernise the Sheriffs Acts of 1634 and 1707.  Reference was made to hospitals that no longer exist.  For example, the Meath Hospital no longer exists as a separate entity.  Time has made other legislation redundant such as that referring to Dublin improvement, the Rotunda Hospital etc.  They related to a specific moment in time and no longer require to be on the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">The Registry of Ships is among the Acts retained and I wonder why it has not been repealed.  There is probably a reason but we should overwrite these Acts.  The Erne Navigation Act is another that I would have presumed had been overwritten, given the navigation channels built in the canal in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">I must examine some Acts that may have implications for my constituency, such as the Poddle River Act 1795.  This river runs through my constituency. Every Deputy should examine the implications for his or her constituency.  Many statutes date from the Anglo-Norman invasion and the Middle Ages.  For the most part, Ireland was Gaelic Ireland and Brehon laws still applied.  We have never considered the positive aspects of Brehon law.  It would be interesting to see if we have repealed these laws or codified them to the extent that we could examine them when reviewing statutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">The old Gaelic system had a more progressive attitude to land and property, which was held in trust for the people in the interests of the common good.  An aggressive form of private land ownership was introduced by others under the feudal system.  Acts that are retained may have an impact in the future.  Recently, the royal charter for the city of Derry was used in the courts in the North to thwart the democratic right of the people of the city to use Derry as the official name rather than Londonderry.  Retained statutes have effects and implications, which will be examined on Committee Stage.  Goodbye to the others, many of which may have served a purpose at one time but are long since redundant.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1370">I have not prepared for this as much as I would have liked because I did not dream that this Bill would be rushed through the Dáil at such speed.  It deals with a considerable number of regulations and statutes and must be examined closely on Committee Stage to ensure statutes of value are not repealed.  Much history is attached to this Bill.  The Minister of State referred to 3,188 Acts and statutes.  This should improve the situation by repealing historic structures that have little relevance to today's world.  Deputy Stagg referred to agriculture, which is still relevant.  It is time this area was tidied up.  When new laws are passed, why are older Acts not brought together in a new Bill rather than a Bill that is an amendment to older Acts?  This would be neater than removing so many statutes across a wide spectrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">One welcomes the changes to old laws.  The matter of wigs and gowns illustrates this point.  The ordinary punter is put off by the importance given to these items.  People will sit and speak to a person in ordinary clothes with greater ease than to a person wearing these items even though some younger people appreciate the older structures.  Those of us on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body who travel to London appreciate the origin of some of these old laws and their relevance to that structure.  However, we are proud to be a modern State with more modern ideas and we are not afraid to get rid of some of the shackles imposed by these earlier Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">We are rushing through this legislation but other important Bills have been ignored by this Government and will not be addressed before the end of this Dáil.  I have referred to the Fines Bill several times.  It was a simple Bill proposed by Fine Gael to address the stupidity of jailing someone for non-payment of a fine such as a television licence payment.  It would be better if the sum was taken from social welfare payments or a salary.  Why is this issue not being addressed when it is more urgent than this Bill, which is being rushed in this fashion?</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">The Minister of State states that the change will "provide a fundamental clarification and simplification of the Statute Book by repealing all statutes enacted before 6 December 1922 with the exception of those statutes that are specifically preserved".  I have not fully evaluated this but I hope to do so before this is rushed through Committee Stage.  The danger with rushed legislation is that positive measures may be dropped and we do not want that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">A typical example of this is dealing with the Office of Public Works.  I received a phone call yesterday about a river.  Unless a reference is included in old laws to cleaning a specific river, it cannot be dealt with and this illustrates why it is good to get rid of old laws.  Cleaning rivers and canals should be based on need rather than history.  A small river beside my home was dealt with under Brehon law by the local council.  It was not linked to the water works and it is now nobody's responsibility.  Much land is being lost and roads are being damaged because of the lack of drainage and structure.  It is vital that we make progress from the archaic system employed in the water works area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">The Minister of State also referred to the need for better regulation, with which I agree.  In this Bill we are improving regulation and trying to get rid of some of the archaic systems that existed from 1070 to December 1922.  Last week we rushed a Bill through the House giving freedom to Ministers and the civil servants to put through regulations and laws from Brussels that were completely unacceptable.  If we are trying to improve the situation we need to re-examine how this House works.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">We are at the end of a five year term or almost a ten year term for the coalition in Government.  In that time I have tried to speak as much as any other backbencher in the House but the system needs to be changed dramatically if the House is to remain relevant to the person on the street.  We come in here for a few days and work by set pieces.  We cannot really deal with emergencies as we should, or have proper debate.  I have had an opportunity to observe other parliaments and seen that it is possible to have direct and honest debate rather than set pieces and in most cases written scripts read into the record for the sake of the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">We need to change not just the regulations made before the State was founded but those on how this House operates.  For example, in the Adjournment debate if we are lucky enough to be chosen we speak for five minutes and a Minister of State, rarely the relevant Minister, comes in with a prepared script that often has little relevance to the debate that has taken place.  That is how the House loses its relevance.  This legislation is a step forward although I dislike its being dealt with in such a short period but it is more important to deal with the relevance of this House today, not just to the people who will serve in it after the next election but to the general public.</p>

          <p eId="para_1378">I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  I agree with Deputy Crawford's last point and as Government Chief Whip I have endeavoured to achieve improvements in the way the House operates by consensus, which is the tradition.  I did not succeed in many of the areas where I tried to introduce reform.  We succeeded with new technology, so that computers are used in the House, there is webcasting, and we held e-consultation which enabled the public consult on-line on legislation, as it is doing in regard to the Broadcasting Bill.  The staff in the House has been involved in these improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">Major reforms are needed here.  I tried to bring forward the Adjournment debates so that Deputies who wish to raise important national, local or constituency issues could do so early in the day, have the relevant Ministers respond and a better public involvement.  Many of those debates late at night are not reported in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380">Leaders' Questions also needs reform and I do not say this to protect my Taoiseach.  When compared with other European leaders he comes out well in respect of the time he spends here.  Deputy Crawford's leader said one day "As somebody told me on the way into the House" and went on to question the Taoiseach about the topic.  The Taoiseach can be asked about anything, from an issue in the Deputy's constituency or mine to radon.  He must be an expert in everything.  I am not sure that is the right way to do things.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">It probably suits the Opposition at the moment but there are better ways to get better information, by having other Ministers, as well as the Taoiseach, here.  Some notice could be given of questions on important national issues and the Ministers could be more involved.  Regardless of who is in Government, there are changes we should make.  Let us try to do so when the new Government is formed, whoever forms it.  Obviously, I hope it will be our side and the Deputy hopes it will be his.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">The debate on this Bill is a timely reminder of the ongoing need to update our legislation.  I would be happy to provide Deputies with any Acts of interest, and to clarify their concerns between now and Committee Stage.  I said this in the Seanad too.  There has been significant public consultation throughout 2006 on the Acts.  Advertisements were placed in national newspapers, last March and April and in September and October.  The list of the Acts has been available at all times on the website of the Office of the Attorney General, <i>www.attorneygeneral.ie</i>.  There is a great deal of interest among the public.  I am keen to see schools become involved in this because it is fascinating work, not just for us but for people outside the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">Deputy Kehoe referred to the Howth and Holyhead Harbours Act.  This Act vested in commissioners the bridges over the Menai Straits, the River Conway, the harbours of Howth and Holyhead, the roads from Dublin to Howth, and provided for the further improvement of the road from London to Holyhead.  The Act has been partially repealed by a series of Acts and the Act may still be relevant to the law of transport and therefore is not suitable for repeal at this stage.  The Deputy referred to the abolition of tolls at Portumna Bridge and the provision for its maintenance.  The Act that abolished the collection of tolls at Portumna provides that the bridge is to be vested in the counties of Galway and Tipperary, in equal portions, and that the respective grand juries, rough equivalents to county councils, are to provide for its maintenance.  The drawbridge and swivel bridge are to be maintained by the commission of public works out of the tolls of the Shannon navigation.  Any other Acts for the repair of bridges in Ireland are to apply to Portumna Bridge.  The Act may still be relevant to the law regarding the commissioners of public works and is therefore not suitable for repeal at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">Deputy Kehoe referred also to the Roads Act which is an Act to make provision for the collection and application of the excise duties on mechanically propelled vehicles and carriages to amend the Finance Act 1920.  The Finance Act 2004 repealed section 6(2) indicating that the residue retains efficacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">Deputy Stagg referred to the Bill of Rights.  He is not here at the moment but he will be interested to know that this Act deals with the rights of subjects and, in particular, makes provision for parliamentary privilege.  The Act is not suitable for repeal at this time primarily because it may be relevant to the law regarding parliamentary privilege.  Deputy Stagg also referred to the Poisons and Pharmacy Act which regulates the sale of certain poisonous substances and amends the Pharmacy Act.  The Act specified that only sections 2 and 5 were to apply to Ireland.  Sections 2 and 5 were repealed by the Poisons Act 1961, therefore the residue of the Act, that is, the long title, is suitable for repeal.  These are examples of why we are retaining some legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked why there was no mention of the Brehon law in the Bill.  The Brehon law was predominantly an oral tradition, rather than statute-based law.  The Normans, and later the English, introduced written statute law in Ireland.  They suppressed the Brehon law over a long period.  Some of the statutes being repealed in this Bill were laws used to suppress the Brehon law, such as the laws of 1210 and 1226 which provided that English laws and customs should be observed in Ireland.  By the end of the 17th century, Brehon law had been entirely suppressed and therefore did not survive into the legal system under the constitutions of 1922 and 1937.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about the erection of the castle at Dublin and the establishment of fairs at Donnybrook, Waterford and Limerick.  This is fascinating.  This is to be retained.  The Act of 1204 had two purposes.  First, it commands that the King needs a castle of greatest possible strength with good fosses and strong walls, constructed in a suitable place both to control the city and, if needful, to defend it.  The second purpose is to authorise the holding of fairs at Donnybrook, Drogheda, Waterford and Limerick for eight days annually and that merchants may freely attend.  This is not suitable for repeal as a High Court action has been initiated by a trader against three local authorities, which may involve the court determining the status of these ancient market rights, despite the fact that Donnybrook fair was suppressed in 1855.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, will be interested in that explanation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">Deputy Boyle asked why we are keeping or repealing Acts.  I am happy to provide information on any Act referred to today or on which Deputies would like additional information.  I will provide that in advance of Committee Stage.  My officials will be happy to help in that regard.  Committee Stage will be on 13 March.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about the research for the Bill.  This legislation follows from the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005, which I also brought before the House.  That Act repealed 206 ancient Acts.  As regards further work, the Bill marks a significant step in clarifying what remains to be repealed.  The Acts listed for attention will be repealed and work is already under way in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">Restatements are official publications which combine in a single text important legislative measures with all their amending statutes.  This means that citizens and practitioners can use a single source for the various statutes, as amended.  Restatements of the law greatly improve the transparency and accessibility of the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">Deputy Stagg mentioned some of the Acts not applying to Ireland.  Any statutes in the Schedules applied to Ireland.  Many statutes of the former United Kingdom enacted between 1801 and 1922 never applied to Ireland.  There is no reason to repeal these statutes and, as such, they are not included in the Schedules to the Bill.  With regard to the question of whether any statutes are missing from the Schedules and what will happen if they are found later, there might be a small number of ancient statutes which have not been discovered in the course of researching the Bill.  Such statutes must be regarded as being so obsolete that they cannot have any continuing effect.  People cannot be expected to be bound by laws that are so obscure even skilled legal researchers cannot find reference to them.  The effect of this Bill will be to repeal all public general statutes except those listed in Schedule 1.  Obviously any Act which is lost in history will not be listed in Schedule 1; therefore, this Bill will repeal all such lost statutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391">I thank Deputies for their contribution to this process.  If they have particular interests, they should notify my Department between now and Committee Stage.  There will be ongoing research in this area and I am anxious to ensure that in holding debates on this detailed Bill there is as much information as possible available to Deputies.  I acknowledge the work of the team of officials in the Office of the Attorney General, who have engaged in detailed and considerable research to identify both the statutes for retention and the statutes for repeal.  It has been a complex task to identify the Acts that still apply to Ireland and to ascertain whether they are suitable for repeal.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnCreganFF" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Mr. Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_1395">I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Roche, and the Government on the responsible manner with which they have dealt with this issue heretofore.  I also compliment industry on the responsibility it has shown in reducing carbon emissions over the past number of months.  Substantial progress has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396">It is not necessary to have the Green Party in Government to protect the environment.  Fianna Fáil has a strong record in environmental protection over a number of years and particularly under the current Administration.  It introduced the farm plastics scheme, the plastic bags scheme, the smoking ban and the tax on white goods.  These are commendable measures.  In addition, the country's water quality has never been higher and the country is 90% compliant with EU directives.  That is commendable and shows how responsible the Government has been in dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397">Kyoto gives us two choices, reduce emissions or buy credits.  We are entitled to buy credits despite the myths being put forward by others.  We have managed substantial reductions in emissions, and more can and will be done.  Ireland is committed to combating global warming and will meet its Kyoto Protocol target.  Already, major progress has been recorded in reducing emissions across all sectors.  Further reductions will be achieved.  If the Government did not act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Ireland's emissions in the period 2008 to 2012 would have been 78.2 million tonnes per year.  Our Kyoto Protocol target is 63 million tonnes.  The emissions reductions required is 15.2 million tonnes.  Emissions reductions of 8 million tonnes will be achieved from existing policies, 3 million tonnes from participation by Irish companies in the EU emissions trading scheme and 3.6 million tonnes by the purchase of carbon allowances in lieu of emission reductions.  The total reduction from these steps amounts to 14.6 million tonnes.  That leaves a final reduction of 0.6 million tonnes to be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398">Ireland is fully committed to meeting its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol.  It has ratified the protocol and will reduce its emissions by 11 million tonnes per annum through measures already in place, including the 3 million tonnes from power plants and large industry participating in the EU emissions trading scheme.  A range of further policy commitments will further reduce Ireland's emissions between now and 2012.  We are fully committed to, and supportive of, the EU emissions trading scheme and agree with the Stern report that the scheme has the potential to become a global carbon trading system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399">We have committed to purchasing a further 3.6 million tonnes in credits if required.  We have successfully decoupled our economic growth from growth in emissions between 1990 and 2004.  During that period our emissions grew by 23% but our economy grew by almost 150%.  Ireland was one of the first member states to submit its national allocation plan for 2008 to 2012, which will provide the basis for the participation of Irish business, to the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">The effect of measures already taken will be to reduce Ireland's annual greenhouse gas emissions by 14.6 million tonnes on average in the period 2008 to 2012.  This will bring us to within approximately 0.6 million tonnes of our Kyoto Protocol target.  A range of additional measures which are currently being put in place will bring national emissions down to our Kyoto target and below it.  These include an increase in the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources and the greener homes grant scheme, which assists home owners to switch to renewable energy based heating systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1401">The renewable energy support system is facilitating the connection of more renewable energy to the national grid.  Ireland will meet its EU target to generate 13.2% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010, removing 1.3 million tonnes of emissions.  The EU emissions trading scheme will deliver reductions of 3 million tonnes per annum from both industry and power generation participants.  The CAP reform and the nitrates action programme will reduce emissions from agriculture by 2.4 million tonnes.  A total of 2.08 million tonnes of emissions will be removed annually from the atmosphere by Irish forests.  New, more challenging building regulations aimed at conserving energy will reduce emissions by 300,000 tonnes per annum.  Energy certification for all buildings for sale or rent is also being introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">We must buy carbon credits and we are entitled to do so under Kyoto.  I have no desire to see the closure of heavy industry along the Shannon estuary in my constituency of Limerick West, as is proposed by the Green Party, and particularly by Deputy Cuffe from the comfort of his Dublin constituency.  I will not allow that to happen while I am a Member of this House.  Aughinish Alumina is a responsible employer on the Shannon estuary and it has taken its responsibilities with regard to emissions seriously.  I commend the firm for doing so.  There are 500 jobs in Aughinish Alumina and a further 500 people are indirectly employed by the company.  Moneypoint and Tarbert are also playing their part in reducing emissions.  They are good employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">If the Green Party wishes to close those industries, it should say so in the course of the next election campaign.  However, I will not stand for it.  Those industries are being responsible and are playing their part with regard to emissions.</p>

        <b>Mr. O’Shea</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
         when work will commence on the development of the 20-year strategy for the Irish language to increase the use and knowledge of the language nationally; and the length of time it is estimated that this work will take.

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_227">
            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1407">On 19 December 2006, the Government published a policy statement on the Irish language, The Irish Government: Statement on the Irish Language 2006.  The statement commits the Government to the development of a 20-year strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">The Government's policy is to increase awareness and use of the Irish language as a community language on a phased basis.  Its specific aim is to ensure as many citizens as possible are bilingual in Irish and in English.  The intention is not to displace the English language but to strengthen the Irish language.  In many European countries, it is a normal occurrence that people are bilingual.  The vision for Ireland is similar, with both English and Irish being widely used on a daily basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">I am meeting Fóram na Gaeilge next Monday to discuss further the development of the strategy and the role of the Fóram in this regard.  I intend the Government's policy statement, launched by the Taoiseach before Christmas, to be the foundation for practical action for the Irish language, based on a modern approach and a comprehensive strategy.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_228">
            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_1410">The Minister's answer is like the statement on the Irish language made in December — nothing really new or much in it.  The Minister has a litany of projects that were started but not finished.  For instance, Fóram na Gaeilge was to develop a 20-year strategy but very little has emanated from it.  The Minister initiated an analysis of the Gaeltacht boundaries but again the work is not completed.  Is the promise of a strategy just a sop to those with an interest in the Irish language?  Very little is being done to prepare a comprehensive strategy.  Without a proper strategy, the current decline of the Irish language will continue.  Recently, I noted the Minister invited statements on the strategy.</p>

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1415">——and then when people realised how comprehensive it was, I would be accused, as with the languages Act, of having too much in it.  For example, the commitment to fully implement the languages Act is a comprehensive statement while the Act covers a wide-ranging area.  The statement states the strategy will aim to provide a wide range of services to parents who wish to raise their children through Irish.  The statement is comprehensive and the clearest commitment from Government in over 40 years.  I see the process as almost like the Constitution and now we need the law.  The headlines are set so that those working on the strategy know the Government's intention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">Fóram na Gaeilge will meet next Monday.  As I stated in the press release issued with the statement, €300,000 has been set aside for the development of the strategy and high level advice will be sought.  Since I became Minister, the languages Act has been implemented and Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla has been established.  Official working language status has been achieved for the Irish language in the EU.  While the strategy was announced in 2005, it was decided a 20-year strategy could not be implemented if we did not know what we wanted to do.  It was then decided to publish the statement first, which lays the high level Government objectives in a readable format for the public, and then to base a detailed strategy on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">The Staidéar Teangeolaíochta has recently reported to me.  It is a comprehensive document which I want to study.  It is intended to have a public consultation process.  There is no point in me publishing a report which I have not read.</p>

            <p eId="para_1419">Obviously, the boundaries of the Gaeltacht will not be changed in the remaining lifetime of the Government.  The Minister referred to the Acht teanga and the stádas oifigúil in Europe, his two main achievements.  Has this enticed people to become committed to the Irish language?  The strategy must be all-inclusive for Gaeltacht and Galltacht.  Its most important aim must be to enlarge the group of people who want to use the Irish language.</p>

            <p eId="para_1420">It is significant that last year saw the largest number of children ever attending Irish colleges in the Gaeltacht.  The status of the Irish language has been enhanced.  All language experts claim the status of a language has a large effect on the interests people show in it.  That is clear if one compares what happened in the last century in Ireland and Scotland.</p>

         his view on whether the national drugs strategy, which comes to an end in 2007, has failed in view of the significant increase in drugs misuse nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1425">The national drugs strategy, which runs until the end of 2008, is achieving considerable success across a range of different areas.  The main finding of the mid-term review of the strategy, published in 2005, was that its current aims and objectives are fundamentally sound and that progress is being made in all pillars through which it operates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">It is difficult to determine if a significant increase nationally in drugs misuse has occurred.  The most recent comprehensive figures for drugs misuse come from the all-island drug prevalence survey in 2002 and 2003.  Fieldwork for a second survey is in progress and will be completed in April, with first reports becoming available in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">While the most recent data on heroin use comes from a study published by the national advisory committee on drugs in 2004, a similar study will be commissioned in 2007.  When completed, this research will give a clearer view of the prevalence and changing nature of drugs misuse.  At my request, the NACD and the national drug strategy team, NDST, recently prepared a joint briefing paper on cocaine, based on existing data in Ireland.  The paper, which is to be published next week, concluded that all data sources indicated an upward trend in cocaine use.  Several recommendations are made in the paper, principally in regard to treatment, but also covering supply, prevention and research, and those are being followed up with the relevant Departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">With regard to the resources available, I am delighted to have secured a 16% increase in my Department's funding to tackle drug misuse in 2007, especially as it follows very significant increases in the previous two years.  The allocation of €50 million shows an increase of 87% on the corresponding figure for 2004.  The significantly increased figure illustrates the importance that the Government places on tackling the drugs problem across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">This year, substantial progress is expected by the regional drugs task forces in implementing their action plans.  Meanwhile, through the emerging needs fund, the local drugs task forces will be able to address the most pressing issues arising in the evolving drugs situation in their areas.<b>  </b>In addition, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, announced an increase of €6 million as part of this year’s budget to address the health-related aspects of the national drugs strategy.  The overall Government allocation across several Departments to tackle the drugs problem in 2007 will be well in excess of €200 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">There have been encouraging signs of progress in recent years in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion and success of treatment services, the development of prevention programmes in schools, the expanding and ongoing work of local and regional drug task forces, and the valuable work being done through the young people's facilities and services fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">I assure the Deputy that through the structures and actions set out in the national drugs strategy, the Government will continue to tackle the problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_1433">The Minister of State may be wondering why I tabled this question.  The main reason was that the Taoiseach claimed there was no serious drugs problem in every village, community and locality.  He was backed by others in the Government, but there is just such a serious drugs problem.  Until those on the Government benches accept that we have a major problem, we will never solve it.</p>

            <from>Mr. English</from>
            <p eId="para_1435">This is the background to the question.  The Minister claims the drugs strategy is working, but that is not true.  Every report, college-funded, independent or from the Government, shows an increase in use.  Seizures last year reached €74 million.  Assuming the figure in question represents 10% of use, one can see how much drug sales and use have increased.  Even in the context of falling prices, one can see how lucrative it is.  Cocaine seizures have risen by 500% since 1995.  The Government may claim the rise is owing to the great job being done in seizing drugs, but we are still only hitting at the same rates.</p>

            <p eId="para_1438">I welcome the Minister of State's increased funding, but can he not encourage colleagues across all Departments to realise that they must reflect on our problems with drugs?  Every Minister should admit that we have such a problem and commit the Government to tackling it.  Community gardaí are a major feature of the drugs strategy, but it has been a total failure.  There are now fewer people in the Garda drugs squad than ten years ago.  It is not simply a matter for the Minister of State's Department but for all Departments.  The matter is not being tackled, and that is why I argue that the drugs strategy is failing.</p>

No doubt the Irish figures are far lower, and we will collate the data over the coming months.  I am sure the Minister of State has been involved at a European level.  What joint efforts are being undertaken to tackle the drugs problem properly using a cross-Continent approach?  We have a serious problem, and I am very concerned that it is not being admitted; the same is true of other governments.  Is the Minister of State involved with other countries to improve the strategy in Ireland and cut supply?</p>

            <p eId="para_1448">The Deputy should hold on, since I listened to him.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">Drugs are a serious problem for those affected, but our strategy is working.  The Deputy asked regarding Europe, and one must consider the situation in the context in which our strategy and efforts are placed.  The supply of drugs has risen substantially.  The amount seized is now massive, and prices have fallen.  That is the background against which we operate our strategy in this country.  The supply of drugs internationally has increased a great deal, and the price reflects that.  It would be almost naive to believe that Ireland might be different or separate from the rest of the world in that regard.  There is great co-operation internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">The funds in the Department amount to approximately €50 million, mainly for expenditure at a community level, and we have mainstreamed perhaps €25 million, meaning that approximately €75 million a year is now going on projects that started at a community level.  As they are evaluated, they are moved to other Departments.  Perhaps 650 or 700 people are now working in the community on projects that did not exist eight or nine years ago.  However, because of heroin from Afghanistan and so on, supply has increased so dramatically that things have become very difficult.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">There is always a problem with joined-up government, but we have the interdepartmental group in which the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Health and Children; Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; Education and Science; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are involved, together with all the agencies.  There is a co-ordinated response, and that is the strategy.  They all answer for what they are doing or not doing at that level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">The context is the international supply of drugs, and despite the fact that gardaí and the Customs and Excise have been so successful with their seizures, as we have heard today, it is obvious that great quantities of drugs are getting through.  We can only equip people with knowledge and awareness, giving them the information on the dangers of such drugs and providing treatment facilities for those who have sadly become users.</p>

            <p eId="para_1457">I am no expert on that.  It is difficult to blame an Afghan farmer, since what he can get for an acre of opium is likely to be several times what he could get for any other crop.  I will get the Deputy the information on that, but the question of building up the Afghan economy is much wider.  We must settle that country's problems, build up trade and give people other crops that will support their livelihoods.  At the moment, the attraction is felt at an individual and agency level.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1459">An important element of any policy is the knowledge upon which it is based.  In the context of the national drugs strategy, I strongly recognise the need for good information on the nature and extent of drug misuse in Ireland to influence the development and roll-out of the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">Research is one of the five pillars of the NDS.  The key objective under this pillar is to have valid, timely and comparable data available on the extent of drug misuse in Ireland.  In that context, the national advisory committee on drugs was established six or seven years ago to advise the Government on the prevalence, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and consequences of problem drug use in Ireland, based on its analysis of research findings and information available to it.  As regards prevalence, the Deputy should note that the NACD, in conjunction with the drug and alcohol information and research unit in Northern Ireland, published a series of bulletins based on results from an all-island drug prevalence survey 2002-03.  That study found that19%, almost one in five, of respondents on the island of Ireland reported ever having taken an illegal drug.  Cannabis was the most commonly used illegal drug.  Lifetime prevalence rates for cannabis were 17% in Ireland and current rates of use were 2.6%.  Aside from cannabis, the most common drugs ever used were: ecstasy 5%; magic mushrooms, LSD and poppers 4% each; amphetamines 3%; solvents and cocaine 2% each; heroin 0.4%, and crack 0.3%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">The second all-island drugs prevalence survey is currently in progress and it is expected that preliminary results will be available in the latter part of this year.  This will give much greater clarity on the overall current prevalence rates of drug use in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1462">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  In the context of research, it is more pertinent nowadays to examine some issues with a view to developing solid data on them.  For instance, why are people taking up this habit in ever growing numbers?  According to recent statistics, drug seizures in Ireland last year amount to €40 million.  If one takes the lower international seizure rate norm of 5%, it means that €800 million worth of illegal drugs were coming in here.  If one takes the higher seizure rate of 10%, the total would be €400 million, which is still a great deal of money.  The Minister of State will recall that issues arose in committee reports where, for instance——</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_1464">Yes, but I am trying to provide some background.  Essentially, one of the recommendations was to examine more closely the damage that cannabis does, particularly to pregnant mothers and their unborn children.  Why do people take up the habit and what are the inherent dangers of using specific drugs?  Such dangers may not yet be fully recognised, so we need to investigate that situation further.  Why are a growing number of middle-class people using cocaine for leisure, while seemingly being in denial that the proceeds of this trade are going to some of the most ruthless criminals we have ever had in this country.  We need to focus more research outside the capital.  Will the new drugs plan place greater emphasis on research?</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_1465">Research was one of the original four pillars of the strategy and rehabilitation is now the fifth.  Research is very important and the NACD is undertaking many good projects in this respect.  While such research projects are mainly national, it has also funded some local ones.  The strategy ends next year and there will be a consultation phase, either late this year or early next year, on a new strategy.  That will provide all of us with an opportunity to tweak it or change it fundamentally, as necessary.  It is difficult to know why certain people use certain drugs, but it may be due to supply and the fact that there is plenty of money around.  The country's demographics, including its age profile, have changed hugely.  Ireland is booming in many ways.  There are many young people with a great deal of money and, I suppose, there is a desire to experiment.  The NACD has done much good work.  Our job is to try to get across to people the fact that even cannabis, which might not be as dangerous as other drugs, can have negative mental effects on a significant number of people.  Much depends on how often one uses the drug and at what age but it is difficult to get that knowledge across to people.  We have the research and are continually running awareness campaigns.  In recent years, school SPHE classes have run modules on drugs, which try to get through to young people the damage they may be causing to themselves.  Many of them already know it.  According to one survey, university students who dabbled with drugs in November, December or January desisted when their examinations approached in April or May.  They are aware that drug use does not do their memorising capacity any good, although they may flirt with it.  It is wrong to give the impression "One puff and you're hooked for life".  That is not true because most people can experiment and walk away from it.  Sadly, however, a significant cohort does become trapped in drug abuse.  They are the ones to whom the policy is geared.</p>

            <p eId="para_1470">Yes, but they are probably not the cohort on which we would spend most of our energy.  I take the Deputy's point and will examine what data currently exists in that regard.  Pregnant women may not be major users of cannabis but if any of them are doing so I agree that we should impart such information to them in a targeted way.  It does not have to be done on television; it could be done through pre-natal classes, for example.  I will take up the Deputy's point with the Department of Health and Children to see whether such data is made available via maternity hospitals or elsewhere.</p>

            <p eId="para_1478">I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 102, 113, 114, 119, 130 and 141 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">Comhairle na Tuaithe presented its report on a national countryside recreation strategy to me in September 2006.  The strategy defines the scope and vision for countryside recreation and sets out the broad principles under which sustainable countryside recreation can be managed into the future.  It also sets out the tasks that should be undertaken to achieve this vision and recommends actions that need to be taken and by which bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">Following my consideration of the report I have taken a number of actions.  First, I have reached agreement with Fáilte Ireland regarding the employment of up to ten walk managers under my Department's community services programme.  Their role will be to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">Second, my Department in consultation with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Fáilte Ireland, Comhar Leader na hÉireann and the national way-marked ways advisory committee, are identifying a further 30 looped walks and way-marked ways for development in 2007.  Fáilte Ireland has informed me that 15 of these will be under way by June 2007 and I have set aside funding of €1.5 million in 2007 for this purpose.  In this context, Deputies should note that 40 looped walks have already been developed with the assistance of the rural social scheme and my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">Third, my Department is actively pursuing the possibility of using former railway infrastructure as recreational trails for walking and cycling with the Department of Transport and Iarnród Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">In October 2006, officials from my Department met representatives of Iarnród Éireann and CIE to discuss the possibility of using disused railway infrastructure around the country for recreational development as walkways and cycle paths.  They confirmed that the only lines that are abandoned and definitely available for development are Attymon to Loughrea, Tralee to Limerick, and Waterford to Dungarvan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">The next step in this process is that my officials will be meeting this week with Comhar Leader na hÉireann, which represents the Leader companies to discuss with them the proposal for the use of abandoned railway lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">Separately, discussions are continuing with Coillte Teoranta and Bord na Móna to discuss the possibility of expanding the use of their lands for recreational purposes and I will continue to progress this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">To ensure that a number of legal issues are addressed as a matter of priority, I have established an expert group, comprising a senior counsel and officials from the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my Department.  This group met for the first time on Tuesday, 20 February and I have asked them to report back to me by the end of April.  Any question of the acquisition by local groups of land to facilitate increased hill walking will be considered following the completion of the group's report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">The Deputies should note there have been meetings with the Irish Farmers Association to discuss ways of moving forward with the implementation of the strategy.  However, I want to make it clear that payment for access is not under discussion.  The IFA has sought a payment for the maintenance of specific walks throughout the country and I am fully in agreement that there should be no cost burden on farmers arising from the maintenance of permissive ways open to the public at no charge.  It is hoped to progress matters further at the next meeting, which is scheduled for later this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">I have time and again made clear my view that a local, community-based approach is the best way forward where issues of access to the countryside arise.  Where it is not possible to reach agreement in a particular location, alternative routes should be explored and developed so landowners' rights over access to their lands are not interfered with.  I will be meeting with Pádraig Walshe, president of the IFA, this week and we will discuss this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">Finally, the Deputies should note that the draft Rural Development Programme 2007 to 2013 has been submitted to the European Commission for approval.  The development of countryside recreation will be a key part of the measures to be rolled out under the new programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1490">I have an interest in the forest park area of Lough Key.  Arising from his answer, does the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, envisage that his Department might market the area as a suitable location for walking and other tourism related products?  These lands are owned by Coillte so does the Minister envisage that organisation joining his Department to provide walkways throughout the forests?</p>

            <p eId="para_1492">I am a great believer in the one stop shop and our idea is that we produce the product, either on Coillte land or Bord na Móna land with co-funding from the bodies in question.

            <p eId="para_1495">I welcome most of what the Minister has said and have some questions that arise from his answer.  Regarding bog lands and Coillte owned lands, there is a great deal of land designated as special areas of conservation and national heritage areas.  These areas supposedly cannot be used for the cutting of turf but this is not being enforced yet.  The bog lands and forest parks can be developed for walkways and they can also benefit the area of education.  The Government could lead an initiative, bringing various Departments together, to ensure that disused bog lands do not become dumping grounds and are properly looked after with footpaths and so on.  Schools could send groups for educational tours of such areas and they will benefit people living in cities and the countryside.  This could be a great initiative, and it is happening in some forests, but we should make plans for bog lands that will be left.  In many cases only 40 to 50 hectares are in question and they will become dumping grounds if they are not seen to.</p>

            <p eId="para_1500">Regarding access to land, the last time we discussed this matter in October or November the Minister said he would consider a suggestion of mine on walking passes.  This would be similar to ski passes in other countries and would allow people pay to have access to certain lands for a week.  This would help collect money for a fund to compensate landowners for the cost of maintenance and insurance and would give money back to the community for the development of walkways and so on.  It would also act as an incentive for communities to encourage more walkers to come, to open coffee shops, to open farmyards and so on.  Did the Minister pursue this idea?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1501">We have done a great deal of work in this regard, though I cannot say I have an answer to the Deputy's specific question.  We have had discussions with the IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association.  I am going to the Sheep's Head Peninsula, Skibbereen, tomorrow and I intend to walk on the famous walkway there that seems to have caused more debate than any other walkway in Ireland.  I will see then what the difficulties are because I am more familiar with the hills of Connemara than the hills of south Cork.  It is fine to discuss such matters in an office but sometimes one gets a better perspective on the challenges people face by visiting the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">My gut feeling is that the traditional way is best in this matter.  People should be fairly free to roam the hills of the country and should not have to pay as long as no damage is done.  This is the most desirable approach from the perspective of tourism.  The Deputy is correct that there is a great deal of work involved and many opportunities for communities.  Preliminary figures I have seen indicate that walking tourism is increasing and we are passing the figures that existed in the heyday before foot and mouth disease caused a slump.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">The Deputy raised a question about bogs, and this is intriguing.  There are special areas of conservation.  Bogs that are small must be preserved and only used for education.  It is important they are not walked on too much and that none of the flora and fauna we are trying to protect is damaged.  Interestingly, cutaway bogs may have more potential than pristine bog; the top has been removed and there are many more things one could do with it.  Many bogs are in the east midlands and I am not against go-karting there and other things people wish to do to enjoy themselves.  We are talking about recreation, we are not saying everyone must become serious walkers for the good of their health.  Many people wish to use the space.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">I think this is a great step forward and I am glad the Deputy has welcomed it.  We are lucky the State owns huge tracts of land with many possible uses and huge potential that has not been exploited.  The reaction from Coillte and Bord na Móna has been most positive and they are engaging in the process, though it is at an early stage.  We have started something that will be seen as very positive in two or three years and will give a huge added dimension to State lands.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_1505">I am impressed by the progress made on this issue by the Minister and compliment him on the work that is being done.  The Minister indicated that the ten walk managers will be located where there are clusters of walkways.  What are the functions of these walk managers?</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">The issue of access to land was mentioned and I am concerned about access to sand dunes because I can see in my town, Tramore, that random access to dunes can lead to problems with erosion and so on.  Are there any specific measures to be taken in this regard?  I know the Minister is to meet Coillte Teoranta and Bord na Móna but are sand dunes and coastal walkways within the remit of what is being discussed here?  Does the Minister have proposals in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">I was astonished to learn from the Minister that only three surviving railway lines are usable.  Are there other reasonably intact lines of which sections have been sold to adjoining landowners?  Is there merit in considering whether it would be in the national interest to buy back such sections, where possible, to develop the type of infrastructure we are discussing?  I have other questions but I will leave it at that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_281" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1508">I will try to answer all of the Deputy's questions.  I envisage that a walk manager will have two functions.  First, he or she will negotiate possible new walks in developing the product, working from home and using a mobile telephone.  The walk manager's second function will be to avoid conflict.  A person seeking information about walks in an area will be given the walk manager's telephone number.  In addition, if a person wants to find out where to get lodgings or a meal or how to access mountains or fields without disrupting farmers, the local walk manager will be able to help and will know what can be done and what should be avoided.  He or she will be able to telephone a local farmer to ask if walkers may use his or her fields to reach a mountain.  As well as being managers of specific walks, I hope they will have a liaison role which will create goodwill between walkers and landowners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">If a walker is using a specific walk and finds that flooding has made it impassable — if even 200 yards of a 50-mile path is impassable, the walk becomes pointless — he or she will know immediately who to contact.  The walk manager will then contact officials of the rural social scheme to ensure the walk is reinstated.  If a farmer notices a broken stile or a gate left open, he or she will know who to contact.  Much of the conflict experienced in the past was due to no one being available to take control when a problem arose.  Walkers became frustrated when they found that damage to walks had not been repaired, perhaps because the walk may only have been surveyed once every year.  On the other hand, landowners often found an area left in an unsatisfactory state or observed walkers acting inappropriately, for example, entering a field with a bull or in which silage was being cut.  The walk manager will have a role in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">Many sand dunes and machairí are in special areas of conservation and are, therefore, vulnerable.  In such circumstances, measures taken regarding these areas would be subject to advice from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  One would not be allowed to damage pristine special areas of conservation.  In many cases investment is the solution, as was apparent in the national park in Letterfrack where a boardwalk was constructed in response to over-usage.  We must start investing in this sector which we took for granted until a crisis arose and we suddenly realised we had only exploited about 10% of its potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">There are three levels of railway line.  Some are open and used by trains every day, while others are closed but not abandoned.  The latter category includes the Navan to Kingscourt line, about which there has been considerable debate, and the Athlone to Mullingar and Cork to Youghal lines, all of which have been closed for many years.  All three lines remain in State ownership and have not been abandoned.  For technical reasons, they are currently not available.  It is a pity the alignments were not maintained on railway lines which closed.  Reinstatement of the lines would have been possible because it would not be a problem converting them back to their original use.  It is intended to use some lines for walks on a licensed basis.  The three lines under discussion are abandoned but remain in the ownership of Iarnród Éireann.  They were not sold to local landowners and offer considerable potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">I hope the plans will encourage communities in other areas with abandoned railway lines which were sold to local landowners to use part of the lines for cycling or walking.  Considerable progress has been made on part of a railway line in the west which has been abandoned since the Second World War.  Walkers and cyclists can use part of the line before taking another route and returning to the line thereafter.  This is acceptable because walkers and cyclists, unlike trains, are able to take a right-angle turn onto another path before returning to the line on land held be people who are willing to allow walkers and cyclists use the line.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">The lines in State ownership are the easy part.  Perhaps sections of the Cahirciveen or west Clare railway lines could also be used for these purposes.  Even making four miles of line available would be a fantastic outcome.  Once communities see what is possible, they will come forward with good and novel ideas.  Our experience is that many good ideas are coming out of the woodwork now that the debate has started.  I thank Deputy O'Shea for his kind words.</p>

            <p eId="para_1516">The Deputy may be aware that officials of my Department took part in a series of meetings in the Department of Education and Science some months ago regarding the matter.  These were attended by senior representatives of Údarás na Gaeltachta, Foras na Gaeilge and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta.

            <from>Mr. G. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_1517">As the Minister has been aware for some time, this issue has created considerable controversy in the Baile Bhuirne area where the former De La Salle college was an Irish language school.  It has been accepted by those who teach Irish that a special Irish language education college would be of tremendous benefit to the teaching of Irish.  We spend substantial resources trying to ensure as many people as possible speak Irish but the end result is not particularly positive.  Consistent improvements in teaching methods are required to ensure children receive the best possible tuition in Irish and continue to speak the language when they leave school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1518">Opening an Irish language teacher training centre in the former De La Salle college would be of tremendous benefit to a Gaeltacht area which people have traditionally visited to perfect their Irish language skills.  I urge the Minister to encourage his ministerial colleagues to ensure this proposed project comes to fruition.  Visiting the building recently during a trip to County Cork, Deputy Kenny gave a clear commitment that the proposal will be implemented immediately after a change of Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1519">Deputy Kenny may not be aware that there is, as far as I understand, a coláiste leanúna in Coláiste Mhuire in Marino.  The proposal is new and interesting and has not been made before with regard to Baile Bhuirne.  I suggest the Deputy raise the matter with the Minister for Education and Science.  It is interesting that I appear to receive more questions on this issue than the Minister for Education and Science who has direct responsibility for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">My Department, the Department of Education and Science, Údarás na Gaeltachta and other bodies are discussing what should be done with the college in Baile Bhuirne.  The idea proposed by the Deputy is interesting and I will mention it to the Minister for Education and Science.  Other ideas are also in the mix.  We should produce a number of proposals for the college.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">As I indicated on a recent visit to Réidh na nDóirí, none of us would be discussing the future of Baile Bhuirne, where some of the land in question has already been put to good use, if we had not made the decision to buy the land.  It is a decision I never regret because it is an incredibly valuable property.  No matter how long it takes to develop something in that location, the site is there to facilitate it.  There is no way we could purchase it now.</p>

            <p eId="para_1525">The Deputy would get more useful answers by asking the relevant Minister, who has all the departmental files.  My Department offered some capital finance to the project but we are only bit players.  The Minister for Education and Science could give the Deputy chapter and verse because she has access to all the files.  The Deputy is correct that it was proposed to provide a national education centre there.  However, it was never proposed to establish a teacher training college.  It is a nice idea, however, and we can convey it to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">A change came about following the establishment of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta.  Its ideas have influenced developments.  I accept the Deputy's point that it is time for us to come to a firm decision on what should be done with Coláiste Íosagáin.  Discussions are ongoing and I hope a decision can be made in the near future.  Technical issues in regard to teacher centres are very much in the education realm.  Such issues are not my direct responsibility and I would not like to pre-empt anything the Minister for Education and Science might say if the Deputy puts a question to her on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1529">Does the Minister not accept that our concerns arise from this delay in progressing the project?  Talk of more consultation and consideration sends out the wrong signals about the project.  There has been major growth in the gaelscoil sector throughout the island of Ireland.  Perhaps consideration could be given to the establishment of a teacher training centre at Baile Bhuirne on an all-Ireland basis.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the march that took place in Belfast at the weekend concerning issues arising from the major growth in the Irish language in the North.  The idea of developing teaching aids will have a positive roll-over effect in terms of all-Ireland education.</p>

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1530">I accept the Deputy's point.  However, if a decision were made to establish another all-Irish teacher training college, the possible location would have to be examined.  That is a matter for the Minister for Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">I wish to make clear that Baile Bhuirne was not bought for a specific purpose, something that was controversial at the time.  The property came on the market and we decided to purchase it.  Proposals regarding an ionad náisiúnta oideachais came after that.  I recall that when the proposal to purchase came to me from Údarás na Gaeltachta, I wrote a three-page treatise on why it should be bought, even though there was no specific purpose for it at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">The purchase price of £0.5 million seems low today.  For that sum we acquired 40 acres of land and a building, on a site adjacent to the Údarás's existing industrial estate in Baile Bhuirne.  Some of the land has since been amalgamated into the industrial estate and is used by Údarás na Gaeltachta for its industrial purposes.  In addition, some of the land has been made available for sports purposes.  We all know the high costs involved in securing land for sports facilities in local communities.  The initial investment has probably already paid for itself and we still have the buildings and most of the land for future use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">I reiterate that the property was not purchased with the intention of building a national education centre there.  That proposal arose subsequent to the purchase.  That is the explanation for the timeframe of nine years since the site was bought.  When land became available in the middle of the village of Baile Bhuirne, adjacent to the existing Údarás lands, it was clearly a wise move to purchase because it would never come on the market again.  If we had not bought, there would probably be houses there now and everybody would say it was an awful pity we did not purchase it.  It is a fantastic State resource and we must use it wisely and ensure good use for it in future.  I have no doubt that will happen in time.  We will continue to work towards that objective.</p>

            <p eId="para_1538">I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 91, 97 and 120 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">Rural areas will benefit from a broad range of expenditure under the national development plan, including water, roads, sanitary services, housing, regional airports and so on.  The national rural development strategy is a small element of the total rural spend.  It sets out national priorities for rural development programming over the seven-year period to 2013 and was submitted to the European Commission in autumn 2006.  The strategy was broadly welcomed by the Commission and, following a period of public consultation, a detailed national rural development programme, based on this strategy, was prepared by my Department, working together with the Department of Agriculture and Food.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">This programme was submitted to the European Commission at the end of 2006.  Officials from both Departments are working closely with the Commission to ensure the programme is approved in a timely fashion to facilitate an early implementation date.  Over the lifetime of the programme, my Department will provide €425 million in public funding to support measures aimed at developing the economic and social infrastructure of the wider rural community.  This level of funding incorporates 10% of the total EU finance available under the European agricultural fund for rural development and represents a significant threefold increase in support for the rural economy over that available under the current programme, which is now coming to an end.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">It is important to stress that this programme, while significant in itself, represents only one aspect of an integrated investment package in rural areas by my Department.  Over the lifetime of the national development plan, almost €400 million will be provided directly from the Exchequer to support complementary rural initiatives by my Department alone.  The CLÁR programme, for example, which is targeted at supporting small infrastructure projects in rural areas will attract €141 million over the lifetime of the NDP.  In addition, the rural social scheme, which provides community-centred employment opportunities for farmers and fisherpersons, will benefit from national funding of the order of €214 million over the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">My Department is developing proposals to establish a pilot night-time rural transport scheme, and I hope to make an announcement in the coming weeks in this regard.  In addition, I have already put in place several measures for the development of countryside recreation.  I will continue to support and enhance such measures in 2007.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_1543">The question in Deputy Rabbitte's name arises from the submission made by Irish Rural Link to the Coiste um Gnóthaí Ealaíon, Spóirt, Turasóireachta, Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta on the national development plan.  One of the points the delegation made was that 59% of the population lives in the areas targeted by the plan.  The delegates raised issues such as the narrow economic base of many rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">I complimented the Minister earlier on the initiatives taken in regard to the outcome of the report of Comhairle na Tuaithe, as a result of which ten positions are being created on the leisure side.  However, it is important to bear in mind that while there are many people who live in rural communities and commute to work, we must always focus on creating economic activity in these areas so that people do not have to go outside their areas to seek employment.  Niche food products are an example of a market that could be developed.  The entry costs for small food industries are higher than for other types of industry but great potential exists and local raw materials are available.  When water and roads are taken away from the €457 million, however, what is left to broaden the economic base of rural areas, particularly CLÁR areas where the population is declining?  What will this money do to improve capacity to extend economy activity and job creation in rural areas?</p>

            <p eId="para_1545">The IDA, Enterprise Ireland, the Western Development Commission, Údarás na Gaeltachta and the county development boards all have a remit for rural areas.  Often the IDA concentrates on gateways but the other agencies operate across the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_1547">It operates in Meath, Cork, Waterford, Mayo and Donegal.  The Western Development Commission covers the Shannon and western areas and the county development boards cover the State.  Everyone has access to development money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">Leader companies have been doing good work at the micro level and have enjoyed quite a level of success.  There was a constraining factor in that I decided at the beginning to put all of the European money into Leader-type action instead of spreading it out to CLÁR and other programmes.  This year, however, we got a good result in Brussels which means we will have three times as much funding per annum as we had in the previous national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">I agree about the importance of the small food sector and we have been working with it.  We have appointed a co-ordinator for small foods who has been on a yearly contract for the past three years.  She has done fantastic work and the sector is growing by 10% per annum.  With changing lifestyles and farming methods, it will be an increasing player.  We have emphasised farmers' markets and they are sprouting up throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">We hope to appoint two specialists to support small food producers.  We must stimulate them and we have said to the Leader companies that we see the focus falling on this area next time around because rural recreation and small food production interlock.  If someone goes to a region to enjoy the rural recreation, he will want to eat the food of that region.  We will see a concentration on that sort of indigenous development.  Where things get beyond a certain level, however, they must go to Enterprise Ireland for support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">I have had other ideas.  I was keen on developing sites for micro-industries.  Hygiene regulations are now very strict and people can no longer set up small industries in their kitchens.  The costs of buying a site, getting planning permission and securing services are very high.  I had an idea that sites, not buildings, should be ready so that a person can erect a small building.  There are other ideas in CLÁR areas we should look at.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">Unfortunately, despite having worked hard for five years, I still have more ideas than there are hours in the day to implement.  We will keep working for the next few weeks and see how much we can get done.  A lot has been done and the sector is well set up.  I hope the benefit will be seen in the time to come.</p>

            <p eId="para_1554">The Minister said he will shortly make an announcement on night-time rural transport.  Will the Minister investigate the use of vehicles that belong to the Department of Education and Science that are parked at the end of the school day and could be used to save the State money?  Perhaps others could be involved locally to fund drivers.</p>

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1555">For many reasons, it would be impractical at present to use CIE school buses, one obvious reason being that most of them are too big to go down the bóithríní.  It is no good leaving someone half a mile from his house.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">I want to make transport available to all rural people as it is made available without discrimination to all urban people.  There should not be a means test or an age test to get on a bus in rural areas in the evening.  I am considering a transport service that will be available to all within the catchment areas where there is currently no transport service.  It might be done by hackneys or small buses, many of which would be contracted during the day for school bus runs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">It is my intention that those who can afford to pay will pay.  For those in rural areas, it is not a refusal to pay that denies them the service, it is the fact the service is not there at all.  If a person wants a hackney, unless it comes 20 miles from the nearest town, it is not possible.  Availability of transport is the number one priority followed by pensioners and those with free travel being able to avail of travel in the evenings.  It will be community driven.  The shape of the scheme will be decided by the RTOs or Leader partnership companies, it will not be driven by vested interests — community good will be the hallmark of the service.  A youth club that cannot get kids safely home has as much of a problem as the person who has three pints and would be wiser not to drive.  The scheme will offer an equality of service to rural areas compared to urban areas.  It will start on a pilot basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1564">I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 90, 92, 111, 124 and 128 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">As the Deputies are aware, generally in rural areas there are no public transport services at night.  While in the more developed rural areas there are either hackney or taxi services, these are totally at the discretion of the providers of these services and do not provide a guaranteed service to rural people.  There is a need, therefore, in rural areas for an evening transport service to allow rural people to fully participate in the various activities, community, sporting and social, that take place in their areas and to address the market failure that currently exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">The Department is currently developing proposals to establish a pilot night-time transport scheme and, in this context, I met the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, in late January to discuss the parameters of the new scheme.  I have in mind a scheme additional to the existing rural transport programme run by the Department of Transport and a small number of areas will be selected to run it over a 12 month pilot period.   Where the pilot schemes will be located is still under consideration, as is the question of funding for the scheme in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">All services will focus on maximising the general community good and I am, of course, conscious of the need to ensure that no displacement takes place of commercially viable existing services as a result of the introduction of the new scheme.  Discussions are continuing between the two Departments and with Pobal, which administers the RTP on behalf of the Department of Transport, and I hope to make an announcement in the coming weeks regarding the pilot scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1569">I have evidence in an internal memo that we began consideration of it in November.  On the day this became a major announcement, I was in Na Forbacha and a colleague issued a statement.  TG4 contacted my office and my initial reaction was that I was very busy and did not have time to do an interview but I later changed my mind.  I am often asked by TG4 to do interviews on many issues raised by different groups and I try to accommodate them.  When I was asked about it, I explained, as I have to the Deputy, that I had been thinking about the issue and that it needs to be addressed.  I spoke about the social isolation question.  Then the obvious question was asked as to when I would make a decision or introduce proposals.  I said that I could not give a time or date, but in an aside I said that obviously it would be before the general election.  If I had said it would happen after the general election, some people would have said that I was being too smart by half — I would have been accused of doing it by not doing it.  I would have thought that anything being done by a Minister now would need to have been moved forward before an election and that is what caused the great announcement.  This matter has been ongoing for some time and I have the evidence to prove it.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_1570">I refer to transport for senior citizens in the more remote rural areas.  Bus Éireann may commence a service on a trial basis on a particular route and discover that it does not work.  There is the rural transport initiative.  Some issues are becoming much more urgent in rural areas, particularly regarding the closure of post offices, for example.  Wider social aspects are involved.  For instance, older people in rural areas who are not very mobile may like to go to town for the day, walk around, have a pint, have a meal etc.  While some people may ask why the State should provide financial assistance, I believe it is part of the State's responsibility to look after such people.  If on a specific day a minibus went through a particular area and collected people at their doorsteps and returned them home again, many more people would avail of such a service.  It would fulfil a very substantial need in rural areas.  As the Minister knows, many people live in fear and become quite isolated.  Could the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs become involved in such an initiative?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_304" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1571">Thankfully, there is no need for that because the Government is already doing it.  The Department of Transport does that and the allocation to the rural transport programme has been doubled.  That programme does exactly as the Deputy has described — it brings people to their local town or village and it is locally driven.  As the majority of its clientele is non-paying, it is much more expensive to run than my idea, which would service a wider spectrum of the community, but still include the targeted group the Deputy mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">Whenever a proposal is made regarding rural areas, there always seems to be a better alternative.  People may propose — something that we accepted as fundamental when I grew up here in Dublin — that there would be a bus in the evening in a rural area.  People may ask why not save the post offices or do something else.  Nobody ever asks whether we can have buses in Dublin in the evening or should we do something else with the money like investing in hospitals.  Nobody makes such suggestions in the urban context.  There remains a massive mental divide between what people regard as acceptable in country areas and what is absolutely basic in an urban area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">We must, of course, deal with the issue the Deputy mentioned, and we are dealing with it.  In a city people need to travel much smaller distances as shops and pubs are nearby.  However, if evening transport was discontinued in this city, there would be a hullabaloo.  Rural areas face a much bigger problem, particularly with regard to the changes in society, because people are more scattered.  When the Government starts to consider the parity issue, we are told there is no need as it is not a top priority.  As someone who lives in the real countryside, I find it hard to get my head around it.  I will give an example of how simple this can be.</p>

            <p eId="para_1575">The Ceann Comhairle will be interested in this example.  Let us consider a hackney in Deputy English's area.  For a small retainer, he is required to bring anybody from within a ten-mile radius to anywhere else in that area between the hours of 7 p.m. and 1 a.m. from Thursdays to Sundays.  He would charge everybody apart from pensioners.  However, we would pay him a retainer to prevent him from going to Dublin on the basis that more money could be made there in a particular week.  That system does not need to be very expensive.  It would be very efficient and would change the whole quality of life in Deputy English's area, as I am sure he would agree.</p>

            <p eId="para_1577">Line clearance works between Claremorris and Collooney, as funded by my Department, commenced in October 2006.  A sum of €5 million has been provided to carry out the works associated with the preservation of the railway line to facilitate its possible reopening at a future date.  To date, €1.3 million has been spent, predominantly on hedge cutting and cutting back the significant overgrowth on the line.  It is envisaged that the works will be completed in September of this year, which is in line with the plan as set out by Iarnród Éireann.  Works are, therefore, proceeding as planned and in line with the budget and timescale set out at the commencement of the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1579">As the Deputy knows, over the years those who want to knock the project have always said that if we went to open it we would find problems with the right of way or the way even though it was owned by Iarnród Éireann.  The landowners have been magnificent.  They have co-operated with what has been very dramatic work.  It has been amazing to see the railway line reappear from the undergrowth.  Rail fencing remains to be erected.  I am a great believer that good fences make good neighbours and that work is to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">Clearance work has already started on the reopening of the line from Ennis to Athenry.  It is to be completed either next year or early in 2009.  By 2011, it will reach Tuam and on the current schedule Claremorris will be reached by 2014.  I would hope that, at that stage, the project would be such a success that we would then be in a position to continue the line further north.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">Another strategic Government decision last week makes this more possible with the investment of an additional €27 million in Ireland West Airport Knock, which will increase the passenger numbers through the airport and further justify reopening the railway line north of Claremorris.  At the rate of progress being made, I would be very confident that we will see a second phase to the western rail corridor and we will see the day when passengers can get on a train in Sligo, travel to Galway or Limerick, or get off at Charleston to go to the airport.  Once Ireland West Airport Knock breaches the 1 million passenger barrier, it will need to be supported by other public transport.  Everything is coming together.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_1587">Opposition parties tend to criticise the buying of credits.  While we are perfectly within our rights to do so, I also believe it is a win-win situation.  By buying credits, we are helping to meet our targets and helping emerging and Third World countries in their development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1588">Only in recent months many of us, including myself, have become converts and realise this is a very important issue and one that is being raised on the doorsteps as we go about our business.  People are genuinely concerned.  It is important to maintain a balance and that we do not compromise or stymie economic growth.  We can be proud of the Government's track record of economic growth in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1589">I wonder if the Green Party is serious when it says we should stop building roads and motorways, that enough is enough.  We cannot afford to do that.  We have to be responsible and the Government has been responsible in the whole area of addressing climate change.  It is a balancing effort in terms of continuing our economic growth, continuing to build our infrastructure throughout the country, and maintaining and increasing employment.  The Government has held the balance well in dealing with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1590">I have just left a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government where the whole issue of emissions and the carbon fund was being addressed.  One contributor went so far as to say nothing has been done by the Government and no progress is being made.  I could not agree with that statement.  When I spoke earlier I pointed out all the areas where we are succeeding in making substantial reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">The 2007 budget underlines the Government's commitment to tackling climate change.  A range of initiatives were announced or enhanced and these will be factored into our calculations of emission reductions between now and 2012 and include a new climate change strategy.  These measures include proposals for linking VRT and motor tax to carbon dioxide emissions and for enhanced mandatory emissions labelling; introduction of VRT relief for electric cars on a one-year pilot basis; abolition on excise reductions for kerosene and liquid petroleum gas used in home heating; extension of the ACI greener homes scheme by €20 million between 2007 and 2009; expansion of the ACI commercial bioheat scheme to cover the installation of technologies such as solar panels in commercial premises and for buildings in the non-commercial sector, such as community centres and sports facilities; provision of an additional €3 million to enable SEI to support small and medium sized enterprises to assess their energy usage and introduce measures to enhance energy efficiency; extension of corporation tax relief for investment in renewable energy for a further five years; new establishment grants for willow and miscanthus bioenergy crops; introduction of support of €80 per hectare for qualifying energy crops, in addition to EU support of €45 per hectare; and grant aid support for biomass harvesting machinery.  That is a litany of enhancements and new initiatives that will certainly play a part in further reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  It is another example of where we are keeping the balance I mentioned earlier.  Hands off our jobs — we cannot afford to lose our jobs in west Limerick or in any other part of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1593">I compliment the Minister and the Government who have maintained the balance in regard to economic growth and in dealing with our responsibilities.  I encourage the Minister to continue his efforts because we are moving in the right direction.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1594">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It should be possible in an advanced society not to have to make a crude choice between economic development and environmental responsibility.  I was present in another capacity at the United Nations conference on economics and development in Rio de Janeiro many years ago when the concept of sustainable development was launched for the first time.  One of the images I still have of that experience is of the business council for sustainable development being accorded the status of a state by the assistant general secretary of the United Nations.  At the same time many of the communities which were affected by rising ocean levels had no representation.  For example, the small atolls and islands, many of them still in the technical ownership of imperial powers — France, Germany, Holland — and the people of Oceania, held their press conferences on the Greenpeace boat.  Some of them discussed the issues of sea levels rising by a relatively modest amount.  They were the people who had to decide.  Some people had taken a decision that they would all commit suicide rather than abandon their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1595">The discussion I remember at that stage was that one would always have to strike a balance between the views of the most powerful, who made the extreme demand that nothing should stand in the way of open-ended economic growth and economic expansion, and the most vulnerable who had little power and were locked into a simple existence.  Matters have changed.  I say that because ten years earlier when writing about this I had said that those who make the case for an irresponsible and open-ended economic expansion in different parts of our planet have had an old intellectual history as well.  It was Bacon who said, "I lead to you Nature and all her children in bondage for your use", and again as nature, "We must gouge out her secrets".  We have moved on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1596">There is a moment at the beginning of empire and at the beginning of expansion of colonisation and at the beginning of international greed and capitalism in which nature and environment are perceived as entities that can be mined for their possibilities in terms of consumption.  We have moved on and the current atmosphere is one in which there is far greater responsibility in evidence both in governments and in communities.  Often the debate is about the how of responsibility rather than whether people should be responsible.  This is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1597">It is worth reflecting on that period from which we have come.  I suggest, certainly in the discussions that led to the adoption of Kyoto and the discussion which is beginning on what will succeed it, this is one in which there has not yet been a full acceptance of the principles of interdependency, that is, these North-South divisions which are primitive divisions in relation to economic structures, nor has there been a sufficient acceptance of the principle of mutuality.  It is still the case that those with the least power with the most vulnerable ways of life are those most affected.  If one was to look at the communities that are most deprived of rights on the planet they are probably the Bedouin peoples who live in the atolls which I mentioned.  There is also an insufficient acceptance of the principle of equality which is difficult to define in this discourse and this argument.  It is not acceptable to those who are at an earlier stage of development and moving out of less than sufficiency.  They will argue that they are entitled to push themselves through the stages of growth that were enjoyed by developed economies.  Therefore, any reasonable version of equality in regard to carrying the burden of interdependent responsibility must require of developed economies that they carry the greater part of the burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_1598">Lurking behind all of this is a debate that has not taken place sufficiently, that is, the debate on the connection between science, technology and society.  It is regretted that the great capacities of technology in producing efficiency and responsibility of an environmental kind have not been applied to the degree they might have in regard to the developed economies.  A factor that must also be borne in mind is that international agencies associated with development, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, often speak about models of development that are examples of bad practice in respect of developing countries that have a long distance to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1599">Turning to the specific issue of the purchase of carbon credits, we must work at our own partnership at home in respect of the relationship between elected representatives and the public.  When I was a Minister in Cabinet, I recall the difficulties that ensued following my introduction of special areas of conservation.  If there is one point on which I must differ from the Minister, it is the issue of bogs.  I am in a position to know much about bogs and votes.  Some of the Minister's colleagues in Cabinet are also in a position to know about bogs and votes, in so far as they set out to undermine everything I was doing in respect of the protection of bogs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1600">It is a fact that never at any stage did I outlaw the use of turf cutting with traditional methods.  I went into it in detail.  I did not even outlaw the hopper that might be used in a bog so everyone's lungs were safe.  What I did outlaw was the turning of bogs into soup through the use of sausage machines that were effectively destroying the environment and causing damage that would not be rectified for millions of years.  People from the larger parties were very quick to take advantage of that.  I acknowledge that there was a price to be paid.  I paid it because I lost approximately 1,000 votes for defending the bogs and putting a limit on sheep that were turning hills and mountains into slurry pits.  Frankly, I know who is involved on whose side and on what issues in respect of conservation of bogs and peat.  It is all history.  Thankfully, the wisdom of the people was such that I was able to survive this irredentist and irresponsible challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1601">In respect of what is facing us in discussing an issue like this, the issue is not really one as to whether it was possible to purchase carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol.  Let us not waste our time on that because it is there.  That is a reality.  The issue is what the fact that we are doing so tells us about our responsibility in respect of the situation we now face.  We have a challenge and opportunities.  How have we met them?  Given that we are purchasing carbon credits — I assume that we are talking about the price per tonne quoted by the Minister if provision is to be made for €270 million — it is difficult not to conclude that if the price goes up, the figure that will be required of the taxpayer will be far more than this and could, in the period of time referred to, end up being three or four time's that figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1602">To be fair, as I have previously said, no one is arguing that the Government is doing something that was not ever envisaged in respect of the treaty.  One can talk until the cows come home, but if we were 13% above our 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level and were at 26%, we must ask ourselves whether——</p>

          <p eId="para_1604">I did not realise I had only ten minutes.  I will conclude by saying that all parties going into a general election where, thankfully, this issue is being treated with appropriate concern should commit themselves to a timescale for being carbon-neutral.  We should commit ourselves to giving such credits as will give genuine incentives to people, for example, through green tax credits, to apply the technology and be comprehensively responsible.  The fact that we are going down this road is somewhat of a confession of bad performance and we need to do very much more and bring the people with us.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1605">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about this very important legislation.  Some of us possibly did not realise how serious this issue was, but it is clearly emerging as one of the major issues in world affairs.  I suppose those who saw the recent film, "An Inconvenient Truth", produced by the former US vice president, Al Gore, realise just how serious the issue is. I enjoyed the fact that at the start of his speech, the Minister said that what is being done is not interfering with growth.  Some of the developments that have taken place in agriculture, such as those relating to the nitrates directive and other issues, will, in the long term, certainly be proved to have created major problems as far as growth is concerned.  If ever there was a case where this Government mishandled the situation, this is one that will prove in the future that more thought needs to be put into these matters, which should and must be dealt with in time.  Time will prove that procrastination certainly cost the farming community and industry enormous potential for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1606">Fine Gael policy on this issue is very clear.  We will legislate in Government to compel all fuel retailers to blend bio-fuel with fuels such as petrol, diesel and home heating oil.  We would remove all excise duty on bio-fuel products from renewable energy crops.  In practice, this would mean that producers would not have to pay excise duty on bio-fuels, the knock-on effect being that consumers would enjoy cheaper fuel at the pumps.</p>
          <p eId="para_1607">In that context, I, as a member of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, visited Scotland in the not too distant past to look at its efforts to produce alternative fuels.  On Monday of this week, we travelled to Donegal to see some wind farms.  We also visited the farm of John Gilliland, the former president of the Ulster Farmers' Union.  Our visit to Mr. Gilliland's farm, which has been turned over to bioenergy, was eye-opening.  The personnel who showed us round are obviously very enthusiastic about this issue.  Mr. Gilliland told us that he and others had lobbied our Minister, who is from Donegal and to whom he has easy access as Donegal is just across the ditch from Derry, to bring in the proposals for planting this year's crop of bio-fuel or alternative energy sources.  Unfortunately, this was not announced until last week when there are only a few days left to make decisions on it.  As a result, thousands of acres, and in Mr. Gilliland's case, possibly approximately 3,000 acres, will not be planted this year when they could have been planted if the proper strategy had been used.</p>
          <p eId="para_1608">We can all talk about these things, but unless we do them in a proper, constructive way, it will certainly not happen.  I heard the Minister's colleague, Deputy Cregan, talk about forestry.  I remember when there was no money in this country or, at least, when we were only getting off our knees.  In 1996, we planted 25,000 hectares, but we are only planting about half of this.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1610">We need to walk the walk rather than just talk the talk.  Cutting down is something we can do in fairly simple ways.  When we leave Monaghan we have no other choice but to travel by car.  The same is true of people travelling from Cavan and Donegal.  People in most other counties have an opportunity to travel by train but we do not.  When approaching Dublin, one meets the M50.  If one has to go anywhere else but the city, one has to use that road.  I do not understand why there is no provision of park and ride facilities to reduce the significant number of cars on the M50 whose engines are just ticking over and emitting great quantities of fumes.  The majority of these cars could be parked at a facility adjacent to the M50 and buses could travel between there and the city using bus lanes and ensuring less congestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1611">A train line is still in place from Dublin to Navan and Navan to Kingscourt.  While a park and ride facility in Kingscourt may not be the location of choice for a rail link from Cavan or south Monaghan, it would be a step forward.  The infrastructure is already in place and only needs to be restructured.  One of my former colleagues investigated the possibility of creating a rail link from Monaghan town to Portadown to connect it with Dublin.  These are the type of options we need to consider in light of what is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1612">Fine Gael has no objection, in principle, to purchasing carbon allowances as part of our national climate change strategy.  We recognise that taking a tonne of carbon out of the atmosphere has the same effect, irrespective of where it takes place, and that it can be more cost effective for rich countries to subsidise carbon reduction in developing countries than to achieve them domestically.</p>
          <p eId="para_1613">However, we oppose the Bill on the following grounds.  The Bill comes in advance of the promised review of the national climate change strategy, which the Minister, Deputy Roche, announced last June, but over which he is obviously still dithering.  No doubt, he is nervous of the electoral implications.  We therefore have no idea of the likely balance between domestic actions and international carbon allowance purchases the Government is proposing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1614">It is important that domestic actions account for a much greater proportion of our climate change strategy than has been the case heretofore.  Even putting aside the moral or ethical question of whether it is right to buy our way entirely out of our environmental obligations, there is a more practical concern.  Early and excessive use of the carbon allowances and other "flexible mechanisms" is creating a fool's paradise by allowing us to delay the difficult policy decisions that inevitably lie ahead.  We will not be able to afford to buy our way out of our obligations indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1615">Without publication of the climate change strategy review, it is impossible to have confidence in the Government.  Although the first national climate change strategy was published in 2000, few of the concrete domestic measures it proposed have ever been adopted.  Even tweaking vehicle registration tax, VRT, to reflect carbon dioxide emissions has been deferred until next January at the earliest — a full eight years later than originally proposed.  This has no doubt prompted a surge in the sales of SUVs and other larger cars this year.  One of the aspects of the budget that annoyed me most was the postponement of the introduction of such a measure until after the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_1616">We have dithered for years over introducing higher energy efficiency standards for new homes, with the result that more than 200,000 were built to the old standards.  I cannot help but think of Mr. McCaughey, the former owner of Century Homes who is now involved with Kingspan Century.  He has preached on this issue on many occasions.</p>

Whether we build with concrete or timber frame, we must make absolutely certain the utmost effort is made to minimise the use of oil or other fossil fuels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1619">I recently got a strong reaction to the price of gas and oil when canvassing a housing estate in my good friend the Ceann Comhairle's own town.  The housing estate in question is completely dependent on gas.  Some of the less well-off people living in that estate find the extraordinarily high price of gas to be of major concern.  Other people to whom I spoke complained about the price of oil.  This matter must be addressed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1620">The Bill before the House is an illustration of the hollowness of the Government's policies towards the environment.  It underlines the empty rhetoric in which the Government engages, in terms of indulging in "green speak" and not undertaking one inch of green action.  The reality is the Government has decided to renege on any responsibility towards our global environmental responsibilities.  There are things we can and should be doing and are choosing not to do.  Those parties which are currently in Government have decided there is a political price to pay for that.  However, there is a greater political price to pay for doing nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621">As with most issues, especially those relating to the environment, the general public is far ahead of general political thinking in this area.  What we must do is take bold measures to put in place initiatives that will change the drastic nature of all the negative statistics on climate change.  The only argument offered by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to date is that, as a country, we have managed to decouple our economic growth from the rise in carbon emissions.  That is utter nonsense.  Every country has decoupled economic growth from its carbon emission growth figures.  To hide behind that hollow statistic shows how empty is the Government's position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1622">In the period from 1990 to 2000, this country saw a growth in its carbon emission levels of 140% while the comparable average figure for Europe was 25%.</p>

          <p eId="para_1631">They have added to the increased figure at which we find ourselves.  We have reached 25% when we are meant to be at 13% over 1990 figures.  The reality is the statistics are going in the wrong direction.  It will not suit the Minister, even though he might choose to do it, to reinvent statistics to his own liking.  Ireland is the sick man of Europe when it comes to environmental policies.  Above all other countries, we were given an allowance that permitted us to exceed 1990 levels when the Kyoto Agreement came into force.  Despite that buffer zone, we have chosen to exceed it by double the figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1632">That is even before we get to the faulty mathematics underpinning the Bill and the money put aside by the Minister for Finance in the recent budget.  The Bill is based on a premise that the price of these credits will be linked to the price of carbon, which currently stands at €15 per tonne.  We know from experience that the increase in the price of oil, which will go upwards in the future, will mean a continuous increase in the cost of carbon credits.  Due to the Government's failure to deal with carbon emissions, we also know the amount of tonnage for which we will have to buy credits will be substantially increased.  The €100 million accounted for in this Bill, the €270 million accounted for by the Minister for Finance, are pathetically low figures that will be exceeded many times when the final bill is due.</p>
          <p eId="para_1633">That money could be used more productively.  I hope it will be when there is a necessary change of government to implement the measures that should be introduced, such as a national insulation programme and measures that transfer spending from the roads budget to public transport.  The two speakers the Government parties have decided to provide for the debate — a figure that demonstrates the depth of Government concern — put forward the incorrect argument that the Green Party will cease building all roads in Ireland.  Last year, we spent €6 on roads for every €1 on public transport.  Unless we correct the balance, the upward trend in statistics, with a 7% increase in transport emissions, will increase incrementally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1634">We have heard the hoary old arguments about decoupling economic growth from carbon emission growth.  At the same time, the two speakers from the Government parties protest that to move any faster is to risk economic growth.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He cannot boast he has decoupled economic growth from carbon emissions growth while stating that he would risk economic growth if he was to take any measures to tackle climate change.  It is a fallacious argument but that seems to be his practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_1638">Anything the Minister states will be to the benefit of the Green Party's because we will contest the general election on his record, the mess he has created and presided over as well as his solutions, which are nothing more than face-saving exercises on the part of the Government.  In the next 12 weeks, the fag-end of the Government, the Minister and his colleagues will introduce a number of strategy documents intended to review documents of the past.  These will include reviews of the national spatial strategy, the climate change strategy and the White Paper on energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1639">These documents will be an indictment of the Government's failure to address this issue over ten years.  They are all <i>mañana</i> promises.  The Government should be ashamed of itself and it will pay a political price for its negligence in this area.  The initiatives must be bold, forward-thinking and consider matters beyond the lifetime of a single electoral cycle.  The Minister does not have the nerve to do that and his party and this Government do not have the political courage to embrace these matters.  The public is aware of the consequences of doing nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1640">The argument made by the Minister and the single colleague who has contributed to this debate is that the purchase of carbon credits is development aid for developing countries.  This is incorrect.  It is a shameful and nauseating argument after the developed world has created the problems with which the developing world must live.  It is the depth of political plurality to suggest that this is the way out of a mess created by the Minister.  He had the means to introduce bold measures but has almost always chosen a different route.  His building regulations, the use of cavity blocks and his attempt to stymie the attempts of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown to set the highest possible standards are examples.  The Minister and his Department wrote that letter and he should not deny it in this House.  He stymied the attempt to set the highest possible energy efficiency standards in Irish buildings.</p>

          <p eId="para_1644">Regarding emissions trading standards, the Minister had an opportunity to make a statement on how the production of concrete, one of the main building materials, should be viewed.  A company in Dublin produces environmentally friendly cement.  The Minister could have chosen 1990, the year the Kyoto Agreement is based on, as a baseline for the introduction of the emissions trading scheme.  The company producing environmentally friendly cement has been operating to these standards for several years.  When the Minister's standards were introduced, traditional, highly carbon intensive forms of cement were given an economic advantage over environmentally friendly cement.  I have no confidence that the Minister is able to make the right choice or has an appreciation of the scale of the problem, or that the Government is willing and able to implement the necessary measures.  The proof of that is the ten years of government that has brought this level of failure.  This is a Government that has failed completely and does not have the confidence of the public.  It will not be rewarded at the general election for its failure.</p>

          <p eId="para_1647">I wish to share time with Deputy Connolly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1648">The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, was successful at managing the national debt, a fact no one disputes.  However, the fact that this agency takes responsibility for carbon credits and this is not connected to ecological concerns demonstrates that it is seen as an economic matter rather than an ecological one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1649">We are taking the easy option by buying our way out of responsibility in the short term.  It will cost us a fortune in the medium term if this approach continues.  We are dipping into the pockets of the taxpayer rather than taking the lead.  The public is far ahead on this matter but still requires leadership.  I recall a profound statement to the effect that leadership is about delivering loss.  There was an opportunity to accept this loss because the public is genuinely concerned with the survival of the planet.  We can do much better than this and we should give the lead to the developing world rather than using it as a crutch.  The row over a paltry 200 buses that were to be delivered late last year and early this year ended with 100 postponed until a later date.  One would not think Ireland had a major transport crisis.  We are also needlessly emitting major amounts of carbon.  We could do better and this demonstrates the lack of connection between the Government's policies and its delivery of these policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1650">The situation regarding the concrete block industry is similar.  It was bailed out at the expense of the unfortunate homeowners who will not have the required standards.  It will cost these people more to heat their homes and the houses will be worth less in the future because they will not meet the required standard.  It was a shameful decision to bail out the industry.  The "O Lord, help me to be pure but not yet" approach was taken in delivering the Government's policy.</p>

In Kildare North, there will be commuter services from Maynooth to Dublin city centre and Hazelhatch to Dublin city centre in ten years' time.  At that point, when one tries to board a train in Sallins or Kilcock one will find that only the peak time service is of the standard it should be in a "commuter belt".  If we had a policy of encouraging people to use public transport we would take a ten year approach rather than simply solve today's problems.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_1658">Carbon dioxide emissions are a serious problem, caused by the energy we use through our dependence on cars, home heating, aircraft, manufacturing, animals etc.  The taxpayer will foot the bill if we do nothing about our emissions.  I noted the spat between the Minister and Deputy Boyle about Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's initiative which I understood would, or would try to, operate tighter regulations than the national standards.  Any builder who gets permission for more than ten houses must achieve a 40% increase in energy efficiency, a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions, and provide 20% of water heating from a renewable source.  That is a commendable way for any council to go, if that is the way it is going.  Other councils should take a leaf out of its book.  This is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1659">Anybody building a house for re-sale should have to meet this type of standard too, otherwise there is a temptation to cut corners and insulation and heat retention values would suffer most in a commercially built house.  There is a company in Doohamlet in County Monaghan which won a prestigious award at the Plan Expo 2005.  It has produced a system which can be installed in any house, old or new, and will heat water from a renewable source.  It heats all domestic water from heat usage in the house, including body heat, collecting it at the highest point in the house and converting it to heated water.  It is more efficient and cheaper than solar panels, costing only €3,500 to install as opposed to €8,000 for solar panels, and there are no construction costs involved.  Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, sees the benefit of the system but does not recognise its value and will not give it grant aid as it will solar panels or several other similar efforts, which is a pity because that type of enterprise should be encouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1660">We should also consider the development of the passive house, a term which has not entered our vocabulary yet.  Such houses exist in Germany where they are insulated to such a degree that they require very little heat, costing maybe €2 per week.  That comes from insulation and the re-use of heat within the house.  We should examine this type of system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1661">There is also a solar roof tile system.  We must use natural resources in a way that does not contribute to our carbon emissions problem.  We have a very high dependence on gas, petrol and so on but there are ways to reduce that.  We do not make enough use of the wind power available at sea.  There are also geothermal systems that would help to reduce our emissions.  County councils have an obligation to lead the way, for example, by using geothermal heating in groups of ten houses.  They should try not just to meet standards but to surpass them, using the standard as a minimum not a maximum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1662">I have a problem with the concept of grant-aiding burning devices for houses, such as pellet burners.  Part of the grant should be given to ensure that people insulate their houses fully.  There is no point creating cheap heat in a house if we let it fly out the roof.  We do not make enough use of insulation grants.  These existed in the past and I ask the Minister to consider grants for insulating homes because they can provide excellent value for money.  County councils should use new housing systems and ways to reduce emissions.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_351">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1663">I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill, as it comes within the general remit of my own area of responsibility.  The concept of carbon trading is highly questionable.  The Minister does not agree with this but I strongly contest the view that it improves the lot of poor countries and allows developing countries to press ahead.  It does not confront the issue that needs to be confronted, reducing the amount of carbon that we disperse into the atmosphere, and getting to grips with global warming.  If scientists say vociferously that we have serious problems it is imperative that we act to address those problems.  Failure to do so is negligent.  Putting off until tomorrow what can be done today is not the way to go about this.  I accept there is no single way to address this situation adequately.  The Minister cannot come up with one suggestion that will totally solve the problem.  The energy area requires various contributions, producing bio-fuels, generating alternative electricity methods and so on.  The easy way out if there is sufficient funding is to buy credits but that does nothing for this country's carbon footprint.</p>
          <p eId="para_1664">An amazing theory is beginning to develop.  We have scrapped our sugar beet industry, although the industry has not been completely scrapped in the United Kingdom or France, both of which are also in the European Union.  This leaves an opening for ethanol production but this is banned under the agreement in the CAP reform.  I cannot understand the logic behind the notion that it will be more efficient and effective to import our ethanol from Brazil, Argentina, Australia or elsewhere.  That is rubbish.  Obviously it would be far better to grow the fuel and trap the carbon at home, and then release into the atmosphere a carbon neutral product.  That is not being proposed.  The current proposal is that we should engage in a new atrocity whereby we import it from countries which, it is alleged, are better suited in terms of sunshine and the length of the growing season, transport it by air or sea to this country and then burn it.  That is daft and illogical.  It is obviously better, and will contribute to achieving our obligations under Kyoto, to grow and burn the product at home, rather than growing it elsewhere, bringing it to this country and doing nothing about our carbon footprint.</p>
          <p eId="para_1665">There are plenty of experts on this issue, all of whom point out the dangers and problems, and their magnitude.  Few of them, however, come forward with precise answers to address the problems.  We must first address the question of the so-called carbon footprint.  That is easily done but if we do not do it in our home country, we are not fulfilling our obligations.  All we are doing is divesting ourselves of responsibility and telling other countries that, since they have not used the same amount of fuels and not produced the same amount of greenhouse gases, we will trade with them and both countries can continue as they were.  That does not address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1666">It also does not address the issue of import substitution, which is particularly important.  Security of supply is vital.  We are well aware that energy imports into this country are subject to fluctuations in world markets and to the political attitudes that prevail throughout the world from time to time.  These can change dramatically.  Obviously it is important that we think in economic terms with regard to production of the fuel and to fuel substitution.  We will not solve the entire problem in one fashion or another, but by developing various means of substituting our current fuel import levels, thereby creating security of supply and economic independence, which is vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1667">The debate we have heard over the past year or 18 months has been well intentioned in some cases but, in other cases, the Government has responded in a panic-stricken fashion.  It has grabbed at every straw, and suggested ways and means out of the situation which merely reflect poorly on the Government's inaction over the past five years.  If we had reacted five years ago it would have been much easier to put in place the measures that would bring us into line with Kyoto requirements.  Targets were set ten years ago and we failed to reach them.  Now we are going off on a tangent and buying what we can when we have the money to buy it.  However, if this economy and the world economy take a downturn, this flash buying and the big talk about the millions we will spend on carbon trading and so forth will quickly fade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1668">It would be good policy on the part of the Minister to follow Fine Gael's policy, which was the first policy enunciated.  It was put down on paper at least a year before the European Commission's and the Government's proposals.  We probably did the right thing because it gave the Government time to read, digest and copy it.  Fortunately, the Government copied most of it.  I well understand why.  The main reason is that the policy is realistic, futuristic, progressive and attainable.  In addition, the Government had not exactly broken the sound barrier in preparing its plan so our policy was a welcome sight.  The Government grabbed the opportunity with both hands.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle was as surprised as I was because usually the Government is hugely independent of the Opposition and slow to copy it.  However, I welcome this change.  We are obviously succeeding when others wish to emulate us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1669">There is also the issue of joined-up government thinking, which means getting the various relevant Departments involved.  I welcome the proposal from the Minister for Finance regarding the abolition of excise duty on specific amounts of home produced plant energy.  However, there is considerable room for improvement.  It is possible to double the target without difficulty, and that supply target will be met.  Every litre and gallon produced locally serves the ends I referred to earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_1670">One of the arguments put forward in favour of importing bio-fuels is that the amount of transport required here in the creation and distribution of the bio-fuel would negate the purpose of the exercise.  Carbons would get into the atmosphere as a result of the transportation of the fuel throughout the country.  How is it intended to distribute the imported fuels throughout the country?  Will they be blown or flown across the country?  Will they be distributed by balloon?  Is there some other means of transportation for the distribution of such fuels that I have not yet espied?  I should have made that point earlier in my contribution.  I cannot believe that argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_1671">However, that argument has another agenda.  Every issue nowadays is surrounded by agendas.  The agenda in this case is getting more interesting as time goes by.  The Government has allowed the situation to get so bad that something must be done in a hurry.  The Government failed to recognise the problem and take action in time.  It now believes the only action to be taken is the fire brigade one of indulging in carbon trading.  This will get us over an emergency but the Government could have done many other things a great deal sooner, which would have been far more effective.  It would not then have been obliged to engage in carbon trading.  The Minister for Finance could have kept the money and not made provision for carbon trading if the Government had done its job properly.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_1674">I thank the Minister.  When one looks back at what the party has said over those years one can see that it has been vindicated.  I hope our time has come.  I recall the debate about Moneypoint, when we spoke about the problems with sulphur and CO2.  A gentleman from the ESB stood up at a public meeting and said that wind energy here would never work.  He said the entire county would have to be filled with wind turbines and that it was off the wall.  I do not believe it is off the wall.  I recall being on the Gay Byrne radio show 17 years ago discussing the environment and climate change.  Gay Byrne was more concerned with fridges being dumped at Howth but I said he should be more worried about CO2.  While it is invisible and odourless, it had to be explained to people that it is one main cause of global warming.  It was a difficult concept to get through to people.  A long period has elapsed since then and yet nothing has been done.  With educational television programmes on global warming being broadcast nearly every night, people are beginning to grasp what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1675">Seventeen years ago, we did know about global warming.  NASA had produced its first studies showing that climate change was happening and even attributed it to human activities.  I do not understand these claims that it is only now it has been discovered it was due to human activities.  We have known it for so long yet successive Governments failed to act.  When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, the official car I ordered was run on biodiesel which was scoffed at.  People have changed their perceptions since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_1676">The latest edition of <i>New Scientist</i> claims global warming and its consequences may even be worse than originally believed.  The last thing we want to do is panic people and give rise to an atmosphere of despair because people feel helpless.  People must, however, realise the situation is dangerous and must be acted upon.  People are beginning to make the connection between strange weather conditions and global warming.  The whole coastal area of Dublin is vulnerable to flooding.  My constituents in Ringsend have had recent experience of flooding and for the first time are asking if it is linked to global warming.  At the time of El Niño, I claimed on “Morning Ireland” that it may have something to do with global warming.  I was told that it was irresponsible to make such a connection.  Increasingly, however, we have to make such a connection to make global warming tangible and real for people.  The problem must be traced back to people’s lifestyles and individual responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1677">This morning I explained to a group from St. Louis High School how the carbon fund would work and how Ireland would buy carbon credits from less developed countries.  They were quite shocked that we intend to buy our  way out of a problem, instead of being reasonable and cutting our carbon emissions.  If the Minister had acted early on the Green Party's sensible policies in this regard, we would not find ourselves in this bind.  The cost of the buy-out will not be €270 million.  Instead, before anyone knows it, it will be up to €700 million.  This is not an alarmist figure.  The Minister can spin all he likes about the decoupling of economic growth from our emissions graph.  The Taoiseach interestingly now uses the green lingo and buzzwords.  He will be the next Al Gore the way he is going but it is not backed up by any action.  Al Gore has a problem with his own carbon footprint if I am to believe what we read in the newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1678">The Minister must examine fiscal instruments in tackling our carbon emissions.  Deputies Eamon Ryan and Boyle explained on the Vincent Browne show how a carbon levy can work.  Domestic tradeable quotas — carbon trading on a domestic level — must be introduced to ensure we are all responsible for our carbon input.  If targets are set, our Kyoto Protocol responsibilities will become achievable.  Is the Minister going to simply dismiss the idea of a carbon levy?  He cannot dismiss it anymore.  It is frankly irresponsible for any party to claim we cannot afford to introduce a carbon levy and a domestic tradeable quota.  Those days are gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1679">I note from today's <i>The Guardian</i> that the British Chancellor, Gordon Brown, was attacked by Ryanair because he had the temerity to introduce a further tax on aviation fuel.  The Minister knows such levies must be introduced.  It makes no sense that someone going to Paris for a weekend by aeroplane can travel more cheaply than someone going to Cork by train.</p>

Reformulated gasoline was the future and the electric car went by the wayside.

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1689">The last year has seen an historic transformation in mankind's understanding of climate change, for which various people deserve to be commended.  Al Gore made a large contribution in the positive manner in which he presented this issue as a moral one and one for individual choice.  His book, <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>, the film of the same name and the subsequent debate around it played a large role in this transformation.  Sir Nicholas Stern’s report had a fundamental effect by setting out very clearly and simply the science as well as the economics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1690">Other events last year very important to me personally were the climate change negotiations in Nairobi, the 12th conference of parties to the Kyoto Protocol, COP, and meeting of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, MOP.  I thank the Minister for allowing me to attend as part of the Irish delegation.  I sat in the chamber with the advance working group examining the next stage of the Kyoto Protocol and where we go after 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691">I had a strong sense, based on a fair understanding of the issue gleaned from many years' reading, that those negotiations were the most historic to have occurred in the history of mankind.  I cannot understand how one could describe them any differently when one considers the scale of the consequences that scientists now tell us are possible if we do not address climate change.  In that hall were some very impressive people, and the European Union delegation did us all proud by taking a strong position and saying it would play its part by setting a target to achieve a 20% reduction by 2020, afterwards moving to a reduction of at least two thirds from 1990 levels, since that is the scale of response needed from developed countries.  The Japanese Ambassador also impressed me greatly with his passion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1692">However, others depressed me.  It is a cliché, but that was perhaps to be expected from the Saudi delegate.  However, I was also concerned at the response from the Chinese and Indian delegates.  Leaving the room, I felt that it was full of bureaucrats.  There is nothing wrong with being a bureaucrat or ambassador, but ultimately they could not take a strong stand unless mandated to do so by their political leaders, which is only right and fair.  I also consciously understood that for those political leaders to address the issue seriously we must go to them as individuals throughout the world and express our concern at the issue, asking them to lead so that our countries can set an example and take tough decisions.  We need them to represent us and do their best.</p>
          <p eId="para_1693">Unless we have public movement and demand of politicians that the issue be taken seriously, that will not happen.  While the science has been evident for the last 20 or 30 years, the political will has not been present.  As a result, negotiations have been weak.  Fundamentally, this is important to us all as individuals, whether in the Dáil or outside.  It is up to us to set out the framework within which we wish to act and behave.</p>
          <p eId="para_1694">An aspect of the Stern report that I very much commended, something that has changed within the last three or four years, is the scientific knowledge of the consequences.  The matter is complicated, and it is difficult to be certain, but feedback mechanisms in climate change are of real consequence.  Scientific colleagues have said over the years that positive feedback mechanisms such as cloud formation might help us.  I commend them on making a valid argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_1695">However, it is increasingly clear that there are several feedback mechanisms that really ratchet up the scale, importance and urgency of the issue.  Scientists are very clear on them.  They have become apparent only in recent years, but they are causing increasing alarm.  One of the earth's great lungs, the Amazon rain-forest, may change very quickly as the local climate and precipitation change in response to more general climate change, killing off the rain-forest within a matter of years.  That would release untold quantities of carbon dioxide into the upper atmosphere, thus creating runaway climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1696">The Siberian tundra is a vast area of frozen bog peatland whose vegetation has not decayed properly, meaning that methane is trapped.  Scientists have valid concerns that it may melt as the planet, particularly the northern part of the northern hemisphere, warms rapidly.  That would release a quantity of methane that could trigger runaway climate change.  Scientists are increasingly saying that by the middle of this century we will not have an Arctic ice-cap, and its loss will further heat the planet, since we will lack its reflective capacity.  Most recently, scientists have expressed real concern that our oceans, which have been soaking up half of our carbon dioxide emissions, will no longer be able to do so, since they will have become saturated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1697">Those feedback mechanisms make this such an urgent issue.  It is not now a question of what we do over the next 50 or 100 years.  The next decade will decide whether mankind goes over a tipping point and creates runaway, catastrophic climate change that will truly threaten its future on the planet.  Sir Nicholas Stern's report was superb in how it showed in one simple graph what happens with various temperature increases.  If there is a 1° Celsius increase, we lose the coral reefs.  In the Andes, cities such as Lima, with 11 million people in the middle of a desert and dependent on glaciers for water may no longer have it.  What do 11 million people do in a city in a desert with no water?  The Stern report clearly illustrates the science, suggesting that a 2° Celsius rise could mean our losing half the species on the planet.  That may seem simple on the page, but how can we comprehend the scale of losing 50% of species?  Are we willing to allow that to happen?  That change is relatively small and does not lie in the distant future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1698">The urgency is apparent, and the scale of the reaction is substantial.  The EU has taken a lead, and I commend it on its target of a 30% reduction.  I hope we succeed in getting the Chinese and the Americans pulling the same way.  We must be honest about this.  If this country is to achieve even a 20% reduction, which is not as high as I would like, we must go from a situation where we are 25% above our target and adding 2% per annum to 20% below in less than 13 years.  That is a quantum change.  Does the Minister disagree?</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_1700">It is of fundamental importance.  I do not believe we will have an opt-out in the same way as previously.  I do not believe we will be able to go to the international community and ask it to excuse poor Ireland, since we are no longer poor.  We are one of the world's worst polluters and have an even greater obligation to achieve the reductions of 3% per annum that I believe necessary.  If we look beyond 2020, we will require reductions of 70% to 80%, meaning that even the 20% target is only the start.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701">Let us consider where we are going.  Sustainable Energy Ireland produced an excellent document looking forward and plotting trends to 2020 under current Government policy.  It will be relatively accurate, since the shifts are fairly long-term.  Rather than a radical decrease, it predicts a further radical increase of 30% in our energy emissions.  We must turn this country around on a dime in the same way the United States of America was turned around at the start of the Second World War.</p>
          <p eId="para_1702">Everything must change, but when I say we must review the roads programme and spend more on public transport, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, questions how we might possibly discuss it.  I ask how his party or its coalition partner can even mention climate change when they are unwilling to consider setting a course to address it.  It would have positive effects for the country, since the current roads-based system is not working.  However, on the individual moral tack alone, that level of new thinking is required if, in a decade, we are to play our part in preventing the planet tipping into irreversible long-term catastrophe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1703">I will return to Al Gore.  Our job as leaders is not to scare people or make them feel guilty.  We are far from paragons of virtue, and Al Gore may have been burning too much carbon in recent years.  However, I forgive him, since he has done a very successful job highlighting the issue of where we go from here.  None of us is perfect, but we are all faced with a moral choice, particularly political leaders, who must take this country in the right direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_1704">I thank Deputies for their many interesting contributions, some provocative and some grotesquely inaccurate.  I will address the last point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan, since I nodded many times while he spoke.  Several points can be made.  The Nairobi conference was one of those life-changing events.  It was in the right place because the impact of global change was all around.  The cries from African and other developing nations, including Vanuatu, could be heard there.  The Deputy is quite right in that respect.  I also agree with the Deputy's second point — that it is not really an economic issue but one of moral imperative, which should inform our views and responses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1705">I want to address the issue of carbon purchasing mechanisms.  The Deputy will recall that at that conference, Kofi Annan made what I thought was an astonishing contribution, calling for action to support Africa in particular.  He said that the flexible mechanism in the Kyoto agreement could be used to positive moral effect.  He also said it could be used properly to help the developed nations of the world to be much more ambitious and progressive, and not to be concerned about any economic impact at home.</p>

          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_1709">It is not Ireland's only response and the Deputy knows that as well as I.  Two or three weeks after Kofi Annan's remarks, 600 scientists produced their report on climate change at a conference in Paris.  They unequivocally placed on the record exactly where we are going on climate change.  If there were any doubts about it, they were dispelled at that stage.  Mr. Nicholas Stern spoke at that conference, which was organised by the French president, and had also spoken in Nairobi.  Another speaker was Mr. Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the UN conference on climate change.  All three of them made the point that the flexible mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol could be used to huge positive effect.  Before any Members of this House turn their minds irrevocably against it, we should think that through.  Deputy O'Dowd said we should not turn against it but should use it where it is logical to do so.  That is precisely what I am proposing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1710">I was amazed by Deputy Michael D. Higgins's failure to grasp the benefit to the developed world that could flow from the proper and moral use of the flexible mechanism.  We all believe that it must be channelled correctly.  The €40 million worth of credits that the Government has purchased so far has been done in a moral way through the ERBD and the World Bank.  It is appropriate that those mechanisms should now be focused in a fashion that delivers real benefit to the countries that do not have our environmental pollution problems because they do not have the energy resources that are available to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1711">A discussion arose from the Nairobi conference about how some people's lives were dominated by the search for sticks to burn in stoves for heating and cooking purposes.  The flexible mechanism can be used as a hugely liberating influence in their lives.  That is why Kofi Anna specifically called for it.  It would be a bad mistake for us to say that the mechanism can never be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_1712">A number of Deputies referred to purchasing credits as a simple way of buying out.  The reality, however, is that purchasing credits is part and parcel of the bulk of EU member states' national allocation programmes.  Countries with good environmental records and good relations with the Third World, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, have indicated that they will develop programmes for purchasing credits.  It is therefore foolhardy of us to say that we will not take that route at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713">I agree that we must focus on correcting matters here and I will come back to that point in a moment.  I wish to take up a couple of points that Deputy Gilmore made during his contribution.  He talked about fines and penalties totalling €750 million and continuously misrepresented the purchase of credits.  That is to his discredit because I do not think he is unaware that what he is saying is inaccurate.  If he were to think the matter through correctly he would see the error of his ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_1714">I will make a couple of specific points because time is running out.  It would be wonderful if we could have a more flexible debate on this subject because we need it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1716">I am coming to that and will deal with it now.  Last week, at the Council of Environment Ministers, I indicated that we would actively support the 20% target.  In fact, I had indicated thus at the Nairobi conference, as the Deputy knows.  I also indicated that we would actively support Europe's target of minus 30%, which should be the post-Kyoto target for the world.  I accept the European Union's view that Europe itself cannot correct this issue.  That is why we supported the 30% figure, which is the way we should go, as well as the 20% figure.  I respectfully inform the Deputy that his calculation is incorrect.  As he said, we are currently 24.5% or 25% above 1990 levels.  It is a fact that the Irish economy has grown by 150%, although Deputy Boyle likes to dismiss this reality.</p>

There will be a burden-sharing agreement on that 20% basis.  One does not simply take 20% or 30% and reduce the existing 13% plus figure by that much.  If it is 20% it will bring us back to the 1990 figures.  I can let the Deputy have the note on this matter, which includes the calculations.  It is a fair question and that is the answer to it.</p>

I am not pleased, however, that most Members made rather specious arguments dismissing the huge benefits that can flow from using the flexible mechanism.  The purchase of carbon credits is incorporated as part of the Kyoto agreement and is supported by people such as Al Gore and Kofi Annan.  It is also supported by the EU Commission and countries that signed up to the Kyoto Protocol.  It is logical therefore that we should support it too.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_388">
          <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_1849">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1850">The development of national policy in the area of consumer protection has been identified by the Government as a priority for legislative reform.  Our aim is to ensure such policy reflects the trading methods and practices of a modern economy and the law is updated and strengthened accordingly.  In fulfilment of these aims the Consumer Protection Bill provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of the National Consumer Agency, the transposition into national law of the unfair commercial practices directive and the rationalisation and updating of the existing body of consumer law.  It also updates and significantly strengthens the law on pyramid selling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1851">The Consumer Strategy Group was strongly of the view that a new agency should be established with a robust and expanded mandate to protect consumer welfare and represent the interests of consumers.  The group recommended that the new agency should have specific statutory functions in areas of consumer advocacy, research, information, enforcement and education and awareness.  All these functions are provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1852">Following publication of the group's final report in May 2005, I established the agency on an interim basis in June 2005 and appointed a board and interim executive chairperson to immediately begin putting in place the infrastructure of the new organisation.  Owing to this immediate response, the agency will be in a position to hit the ground running when the Bill is enacted following its passage through the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1853">The Bill includes provisions allowing the new agency to be a forceful advocate of the consumer's case in public debate.  These provisions are designed to ensure the new agency will represent consumer interests within the policy making arena, thereby ensuring that the promotion of consumer welfare is brought to the forefront of the national agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1854">The agency shall also conduct, commission and publish research on consumer issues.  This reflects the strong view of the Consumer Strategy Group that well-founded research is an essential prerequisite to enable the agency to act as a vigorous advocate for consumers.  By being well informed, the agency will be in a position to debate issues from a position of strength.  It will also promote public awareness, conduct public information campaigns and promote educational activities and initiatives.  The aim and intention behind this shift in consumer policy is to empower consumers, make them better informed as to their rights and allow them to be more assertive in exercising those rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1855">The Bill incorporates important statutory protections for consumers by outlawing a wide range of unfair, misleading and aggressive commercial practices.  In this respect, the Bill transposes the European Union's unfair commercial practices directive and updates and modernises our existing national consumer protection code.  A total of nine consumer statutes are repealed and replaced, the oldest of which dates back to 1887.</p>
          <p eId="para_1856">This new body of law will ensure consumers can have confidence that they will be treated fairly in their commercial dealings with traders and the relationship between consumers and traders will be based on fairness and respect.  To enforce these statutory provisions the agency will inherit the enforcement functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs but will also be armed with a number of additional and novel enforcement options.  In addition, the Bill provides for significant penalties for traders found guilty of offences under the Bill.  I will deal with these enforcement provisions in detail in a few moments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1857">Specifically, the Bill will ensure the National Consumer Agency has all necessary powers to actively enforce the statutory protections afforded consumers and aggressively pursue those traders who do not comply with their obligations.  The Bill further provides specific protections for persons who report offences to the National Consumer Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1858">Before summarising the main provisions of the Consumer Protection Bill, I pay tribute to the work of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs over a period of almost 30 years.  It has had an almost exclusively enforcement based function and consumers have much cause to be thankful for the protection afforded by the office over those years. The experience and expertise built up over that time will not be lost but will transfer to the National Consumer Agency and become part of the much expanded remit of the new organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1859">In regard to the text of the legislation I would be pleased to expand further on any particular aspect of the Bill in replying to this debate and I welcome the contribution of all Members of the House in that regard.  Part 2 provides for the establishment of the new National Consumer Agency.  Many of the provisions of this Part impose standard corporate governance type powers, duties and obligations on the agency and its staff.  Within this Part, section 8, which sets out the agency's functions, is key.  The agency will have a general function of promoting consumer welfare and will be responsible for investigating, enforcing and encouraging compliance with consumer law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1860">The agency is given specific functions in advising and making recommendations to the Government and Ministers on any policy or legislative proposal impacting upon consumers.  It is empowered to recommend new legislative proposals to Ministers and will be entitled to submit recommendations to any other public body regarding any matter impacting on the welfare of consumers.  A statutory power of this sort is important in ensuring that the views of the agency are afforded the status they deserve in the policy making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1861">The National Consumer Agency will promote the development of alternative dispute resolution procedures as a means of resolving disputes arising out of consumer transactions.  Increasingly, such arrangements are seen internationally as an alternative to expensive court proceedings.  The section also makes the agency responsible for carrying out the functions previously exercised by the Director of Consumer Affairs and transferred to the agency by section 37.</p>
          <p eId="para_1862">Section 9 allows the Minister to consult the agency on proposals for legislation aimed specifically at consumers.  This section obliges the agency to keep existing consumer protection legislation under review and to submit to the Minister and other Ministers appropriate proposals in regard to such legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1863">Sections 10 to 13, inclusive, relate to the appointment of the members and chairperson of the agency and set out the procedures in regard to meetings of the agency and the manner in which it shall carry out its business.  Sections 14 to 17, inclusive, provide for the appointment and certain terms and conditions of employment of the chief executive officer of the agency.  For example, the section prohibits a former chief executive, for a period of 12 months after he or she ceases to be chief executive, from acting as a consultant or taking employment where he or she is likely to use or disclose information acquired in the performance of his or her functions as chief executive.  The chief executive will be obliged to give evidence before Oireachtas committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1864">Section 20 obliges the agency periodically to prepare and submit to the Minister strategy statements and annual work programmes.  It is critical the State and the taxpayer attain maximum value for money from the resources employed in protecting consumer interests.  Thus, section 21 provides that the agency shall enter into co-operation agreements with other public bodies to be prescribed by the Minister.  The purpose of such agreements is to facilitate co-operation and avoid duplication of activities while at the same time permitting consultation and joint studies and analysis involving the agency and those other bodies that are parties to such agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1865">The inclusion of these provisions will also enable the agency to provide a strong consumer voice to complement the work of the various sectoral regulators and to question their decisions if they are seen to act against the interests of consumers.  Copies of co-operation agreements must be made available to the public.  I intend to consult other Ministers before prescribing any other bodies in accordance with these arrangements, but I envisage that existing sectoral regulators will be among the bodies so prescribed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1866">Section 22 requires the agency to provide the Minister with a copy of its annual report and that such reports be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 23 obliges the agency to keep proper accounts and to submit its accounts for audit to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Copies of the accounts and of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report shall be presented to the Minister, who shall lay copies of them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1867">Sections 25 to 29, inclusive, provide important administrative powers and obligations in regard to the staffing of the agency and the conduct by it of its business.  This includes, for instance, provisions in regard to the disclosure by board members of beneficial interests, and the power of the agency to recruit consultants, have a seal of office and borrow money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1868">Section 30 provides that the agency may appoint authorised officers for enforcement purposes.  Authorised officers employed by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs who were appointed under the Consumer Information Act 1978 will be transferred to the new agency.  The section sets out the powers of authorised officers to enter, inspect and search premises in investigating alleged breaches of the Bill.  Officers may be accompanied by members of the Garda Síochána when engaged in such enforcement activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1869">Sections 31 and 32 relate to the circumstances in which confidential information, including information relating to the commission of offences, may or may not be disclosed by the agency.  The agency is, for example, permitted to disclose such information to, and receive such information from, certain prescribed bodies, including other enforcement agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1870">Section 35 allows for the transfer to the agency of existing staff of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  These staff are currently civil servants employed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  At any time within 24 months after the establishment of the agency, they may opt to return to the Department and preserve their Civil Service status.  There will be no change to their terms or conditions of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1871">Sections 37 to 39 provide for the effective transfer of functions, property and agreements vested in the Director of Consumer Affairs to the agency on establishment day.  This will allow for the smooth transition from one public body to another without any interruption in the public services provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1872">Part 3<b> </b>of the Bill focuses on prohibiting a wide range of unfair, misleading or aggressive trading practices.  This part also transposes the EU’s unfair commercial practices directive.  The aim of the directive is to harmonise the laws of EU member states and provide a high level of consumer protection.  Consumers will enjoy similar levels of protection for purchases made throughout the European Union, while business will benefit from having a common framework of rules instead of a host of disparate national regulations.  Studies undertaken by the European Commission show that Irish consumers make higher levels of cross-border purchases and that Irish business has higher levels of cross-border sales than the European Union average.  The harmonisation effected by the directive will, therefore, benefit both consumers and business in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1873">This part introduces several new elements to Irish consumer law.  Ireland, for example, is one of the few EU member states that does not have a general legislative clause dealing with fair and unfair trading towards consumers.  Section 41, which gives effect to the general prohibition of unfair commercial practices contained in the directive, fills this gap in our consumer protection code.  It provides that a commercial practice is unfair where it is contrary to the general principle of good faith in the trader's field of activity or the standard of skill and care that a trader could reasonably be expected to exercise towards consumers.  The main advantage of a general clause of this type is that it can be used to combat novel commercial practices that are not covered by specific provisions in consumer legislation as well as practices that are consciously designed by unscrupulous traders to fall outside the scope of such legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1874">Sections 42 to 45, inclusive, prohibit misleading commercial practices.  These provisions have some elements in common with the provisions of the Merchandise Marks and Consumer Information Acts on false and misleading trade descriptions and advertising but are broader in scope.  The sale of a house or other property, for instance, is outside the scope of existing domestic consumer law but is included in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1875">Section 46 provides that the omission of material information to consumers is a misleading practice.  This is not expressly provided for in our current legislation and is a useful addition.  Section 48 allows the Minister to make consumer information regulations to specify certain information that should be provided to consumers in specified transactions.  The section is broadly similar to the provisions of the Consumer Information Act on marking and advertising orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1876">Sections 50 to 52, inclusive, relate to aggressive commercial practices and bring a further new element in our consumer protection law.  Aggressive commercial practices are defined as practices involving harassment, coercion or undue influence that impair consumers' freedom of choice and affect their purchasing decisions.  They include pressure sales tactics that seek to intimidate or coerce consumers, and practices that seek to take advantage of consumers who are vulnerable by virtue of misfortune or circumstance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1877">The practices described in the foregoing sections are prohibited only in circumstances where they would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that he or she would not otherwise make.  The intention behind this test is that a practice should not be regarded as unfair, misleading or aggressive unless it impinges on consumer decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1878">Section 53 contains an extensive list of commercial practices that are prohibited in all circumstances.  These are not subject to the same transactional decision test on the basis that they are deemed of their nature to impair consumer decision making in all cases.  These practices include prize promotions where there is either no prize or consumers must make a payment in order to claim a prize, false claims that products can cure illnesses, false claims that a product or trader has an endorsement or authorisation or that a trader is about to cease trading or move premises, and persistent unwanted cold calling.  While some of these practices might well have been covered by the provisions in our existing legislation, others possibly were not.  It is helpful to have them dealt with by means of clear and specific prohibitions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1879">Sections 55 to 58, inclusive, relate to price display regulations, the provision of weighing facilities in grocery retail outlets and the prevention of persons from reading prices.  These provisions are based on provisions in existing domestic consumer legislation which still have a useful role to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_1880">Before discussing sections 59 and 60, which deal with the fixing of maximum prices during a state of emergency affecting the supply of a product, I will refer to the extensive range of other price-fixing powers being repealed by this Bill.  The Prices Acts 1958-72 confer seven separate powers on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to fix maximum prices.  The only one of these that is being retained is that dealing with emergency situations.  The Consumer Strategy Group recommended the repeal of the price control provisions of the Prices Acts, and this view is supported by the Competition Authority, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, and the National Consumer Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1881">Our experience with price controls, particularly in the period from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s when extensive recourse was had to them, strongly supports the view that they are an entirely ineffective way of restraining prices.  Emergency situations can arise, nevertheless, in which normal competitive forces do not apply.  It is prudent to make provision for such circumstances.  Factors such as the volatility of oil supplies, the increased likelihood of extreme weather events and the lengthening of supply chains for many products underline the need for such a provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1882">Section 60 amends the provision at section 16 of the Prices Act 1958 by providing that orders fixing maximum prices during such a state of emergency should be made by the Government and not by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I include this provision to emphasise the exceptional nature of these powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1883">Part 4 deals with pyramid schemes.  It replaces the Pyramid Selling Act 1980, which has proved ineffective in dealing with modern manifestations of pyramid selling.  It also expands considerably on the relatively brief provision on pyramid schemes in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.  It prohibits participation in pyramid schemes as well as the establishment, operation or promotion of such schemes.  It also seeks to close off the loopholes in the existing law that the promoters of these schemes have exploited by, among other things, seeking to depict payments to the schemes as "gifts".</p>
          <p eId="para_1884">The penalties for offences relating to pyramid schemes are also being increased to a fine of up to €150,000 and a prison term of up to five years.  Pyramid schemes are insidious and exploitative and I am determined that the law should take a tough approach to those who promote and participate in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1885">Part 5 deals with civil and criminal enforcement.  Under existing law, the Director of Consumer Affairs has effectively just two ways of getting businesses to comply with their legal obligations.  The director could use his or her influence to seek voluntary compliance from traders or could take legal proceedings against them.  Although the Act gave the director power to seek an injunction against misleading practices, such injunctions could only be obtained in the High Court, a factor which made them a difficult option in the great majority of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1886">The efforts of successive directors and their staff to secure voluntary compliance with consumer legislation have achieved a great deal over the years and will continue to be an important part of the work of the NCA.  Modern regulatory thinking, however, emphasises the need to provide enforcement bodies with a wide and flexible range of powers and sanctions to secure compliance with the law and, where necessary, to ensure that those who flout it are dealt with firmly and effectively.  Thus the Bill makes provision for a number of intermediate steps, which may be used before taking legal proceedings against an errant trader.</p>
          <p eId="para_1887">Section 71 provides that where the agency considers that there is a case for seeking an injunction or prohibition order against a trader in respect of a prohibited act or practice, it will have the option of accepting a written undertaking from that trader containing whatever terms and conditions the agency considers appropriate in the circumstances.  If the trader subsequently fails to comply with the terms of the undertaking, the agency may then apply for a prohibition order.</p>
          <p eId="para_1888">Section 73 similarly provides that when the agency considers that a trader has engaged in prohibited activity, it will have the option of serving a compliance notice on the trader concerned directing him or her to remedy the prohibited act or practice.  If the trader does not appeal the notice, it takes effect within a specified period.  Failure by a trader to comply with the terms of a compliance notice is an offence and may lead to the taking of criminal proceedings against him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1889">These provisions have clear advantages for the agency, which will have new options for dealing with traders where costly and time-consuming recourse to the courts may not be necessary.  It has advantages for traders who are given the opportunity and incentive to correct their behaviour and comply with their obligations without having to face court proceedings.  However, businesses that enter into undertakings with the agency, or accept compliance notices served by it, and then proceed to ignore the terms of those undertakings or notices will face legal proceedings and whatever sanctions may result from those proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1890">Section 83 will permit the agency to impose on-the-spot fines on traders for offences relating to price display.  This is in line with a recommendation of the consumer strategy group and again reflects the view that, where it is practicable to secure effective enforcement of consumer law by means other than going to court, this should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1891">Many businesses spend a great deal of money building a reputation for themselves and their products.  Bringing to public attention the names of traders who breach consumer legislation can, therefore, be a powerful sanction and a compelling incentive to compliance.  This is particularly so for large businesses for which fines may represent a negligible sanction.  Thus, section 80 permits a court, on the application of the agency, to require a trader convicted of a number of specified offences to publish, at his or her expense, a corrective statement in respect of the facts relating to the offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1892">Section 84 requires the agency to maintain a list of traders convicted of criminal offences, subject to court orders, giving an undertaking, served with a compliance notice, or subject to a fixed payment notice and to publish this list at any time and in any form it considers appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1893">A further element of this part of the Bill to which I draw attention is the enhanced provision made for redress for consumers.  Section 72 gives consumers aggrieved by a prohibited act or practice a right of action for relief by way of damages against the trader who has committed the act or practice in question.  In some cases, it is sufficient that a practice detrimental to consumers is halted whether as a result of civil or criminal proceedings.  In cases, however, where consumers have suffered loss or damage as a result of such an act or practice, it is right that they should have an opportunity to seek redress for that loss or damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1894">Section 80, to which I have already referred, further permits a court to require a trader convicted of an offence under the Act to pay appropriate compensation to a consumer who has suffered loss or damage as a result of the offence.  Such a compensation order may be instead of, or in addition to, any fine or penalty the court may impose on the trader.</p>
          <p eId="para_1895">Part 5 provides for tougher penalties, particularly for repeat offenders.  Section 77 maintains the maximum fine of €3,000 for summary convictions and €60,000 for convictions on indictment.  However, the section also provides for a maximum fine of €5,000 for a subsequent summary conviction for the same offence and of €100,000 for a subsequent conviction on indictment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1896">The section also provides for additional penalties for continuing contraventions by persons convicted of offences.  It is right to penalise more heavily those traders who repeatedly breach the law.  A substantial part of the overall detriment suffered by consumers, results from the activities of a small number of hard-core transgressors and these should be a particular target of enforcement action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1897">Part 6 introduces a number of miscellaneous provisions.  Section 85 provides protection to people who report breaches to the agency and is, in effect, a whistleblower clause.  Sections 86 and 87 give recognition to codes of practice drawn up by traders or groups of traders, allow the agency to approve such codes and for the provisions of a code to be admissible in court proceedings.  Section 88 allows the agency to issue guidelines to traders and consumers alike in regard to the practicality of transacting business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1898">There is one non-consumer provision in the Bill.  Section 94 amends the Industrial Development Act 1993 to give retrospective effect to an assignment of powers made by Forfás to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland on 26 May 2006.  The assignment of powers is being made retrospective to 25 July 2003, the date the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003 came into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1899">This provision is necessary because the 2003 Act consolidated provisions dealing with employment grants that had been included in the 1986, 1991 and 1993 Acts.  As a consequence, a new assignment of powers to the agencies to make employment grants under section 25 of the 2003 Act was necessary.  However, this assignment was not made until 26 May 2006, with the result that the agencies were acting <i>ultra vires</i> in approving employment grants in the period between 25 July 2003 when the 2003 Act was commenced and 26 May 2006.  The Attorney General has advised that primary legislation is necessary to make the assignment of powers retrospective to 25 July 2003.  While any potential financial liability arising for the State on foot of the delay in assigning the powers is judged to be minimal, any potential risk should be closed off by introducing the necessary validating legislation at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1900">Section 95 amends the Casual Trading Act 1995 to allow the Minister to introduce statutory guidelines for local authorities in regard to the issuing of casual trading licences.  The consumer strategy group was strongly of the view that a lack of consistency on the part of local authorities in this regard significantly inhibited the growth of casual trading thereby effectively restricting consumer choice.  The group specifically recommended in its report that the Minister should be empowered to issue statutory guidelines obliging local authorities to apply a consistent approach when granting casual trading licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1901">The Department issued non-statutory guidelines on this matter to local authorities in July 2005 and again in July 2006 with a view to their being implemented on a voluntary basis.  Should it be that the voluntary guidelines do not bring about a more consistent approach by local authorities, I will use the powers proposed in this amendment to make the necessary regulations to introduce statutory guidelines in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1902">Section 96 amends the Hallmarking Act of 1981 to take account of the repeal of the Merchandise Marks Act 1887.  Sections 97 and 98 provide important additional powers to the agency in the enforcement of product safety regulations.  They will allow it to request the customs authorities to detain products until their conformity with product safety rules can be determined.  The changes will also facilitate admissibility of laboratory tests carried out in other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1903">I will introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  These will be mainly of a technical nature, although others will serve to strengthen the protections afforded to consumers under the Bill.  Principal among these will be a group of amendments to provide a role for the Financial Regulator in enforcing the provisions of the Bill in the financial services sector.  The provisions of this Bill apply to all sectors of the economy and offer protection to consumers whether they are buying a loaf of bread or taking out a mortgage with their local bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_1904">Deputies will be aware of the role of the Financial Regulator in protecting the interests of consumers in their dealings with the financial services industry.  As the regulator has particular expertise in the sector, it is not reasonable to expect it should be replicated within the National Consumer Agency.  Traders in the financial services sector are subject to an administrative sanctions regime that includes the role of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The ombudsman is an independent statutory complaints officer with power to award compensation to consumers who suffer damage as a result of their dealing with regulated financial services providers.  It is prudent to ensure that the prohibitions contained in the Consumer Protection Bill are brought within that regime in so far as the financial services sector is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1905">Bearing in mind what I have said, I have decided in consultation with the Minister for Finance that it would be prudent to provide that the Financial Regulator should have parallel powers to the agency when it comes to enforcing, in the financial services sector, the prohibitions on unfair commercial practices as set out in the Bill.  The co-operation agreement between the agency and the regulator will ensure proper consultation and transparency in the exercise by the two regulators of their respective powers in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1906">I will also introduce provisions to prohibit discrimination against consumers on grounds of method of payment and to allow the National Consumer Agency to promote quality assurance schemes among traders.  These provisions arose from proposals by Senators Cox and Coghlan in the Seanad and I will table amendments on Committee Stage in this House.  I will also further strengthen the powers of the agency in the area of product safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1907">The Bill represents a fundamental realignment of national consumer policy by establishing a new agency with much expanded and enhanced powers and in effect creating a forceful new consumer advocate, which has been lacking in public debate and policy making in recent years.  Furthermore, the Bill replaces nine existing pieces of primary legislation with this single statute.  This represents a significant gain in the accessibility and transparency of our consumer protection code and one that I am determined to extend to the remaining areas of that code.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_389">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_1908">Fine Gael will support this Bill on Second Stage, although we will seek to amend it on Committee Stage.  The Bill is long overdue and it is surprising that it has come so late in the five-year term of the Government.  Its powers are much weaker than they should be.  It is weak because the National Consumer Agency has nothing like the powers it needs to have a reliable role to protect consumers.  It is late because my party introduced a Bill two years ago and we were promised we would have an immediate Bill from the Government.  Two years later, we finally get the fruits of the Government's labour.  On that occasion, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats voted down the Bill on the basis that their own Bill was coming.  Perhaps they felt the powers we were granting the consumer agency were too great, which seems to be borne out by the contents of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1909">For the past eight years Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats have played a cruel, <i>laissez-faire</i> game in the area of consumer protection.  They sat back as the economic boom let rip and every scam artist and rip-off merchant in the country made a mint.  Irish consumers were treated to the highest inflation in Europe, the highest prices in Europe and the worst value for money.  Last week, inflation hit a disgracefully high level of 5.2%.  Inflation during the 1994 to 1997 Government was 1.5%.  Government and regulator-controlled prices are rising almost three times faster than private sector prices — a stunning 55% between 2001 and Oct 2006 compared to 18.3% in the private sector.  Wherever the Government has control over prices, it is three times out of kilter with the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1910">After years of this hardship, the Government has now proposed the establishment of the National Consumer Agency.  I welcome the principle of the agency and we will attempt to amend its proposed powers on Committee Stage.  During the debate on the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill in the Dáil in 2005 to create a consumer rights enforcer, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, referred to "comprehensive measures and policies already in place and envisaged, both domestically and internationally, to protect and represent consumer interests".  He then instructed Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Deputies to vote down our reasonable proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1911">This was followed by the "Rip off?  What rip off?" approach of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, who condemned Fine Gael for even raising the issue.  I am glad that he has been shouted down at Cabinet and the Government is now starting to acknowledge the problem.  For the record, let it be clear that this Government is the father of rip off Ireland.  No fewer than 50 stealth taxes and charges have been introduced by the Government since the last general election — many of them introduced shortly after the general election.  On everything from ESB bills to passport fees, the only way has been up.  In the 12 months to January 2007, consumers saw increases in college fees, exam fees, electricity prices by 12.6%, average monthly gas bills by €15.50, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann fares, Iarnród Éireann and Luas fares, M50 and M4 tolls by 10c and the television licence fee.  The list is endless.</p>
          <p eId="para_1912">Ireland has become a graveyard for consumers with annual inflation at its highest level for four years and further electricity price rises yet to take effect.  The price increases in the 12 months to December 2006 were the highest for four years.  Prices have increased by 5.2% and the electricity price increase is yet to bite.  A comparison with prices across Europe shows that Irish prices have risen in the past 12 months at a rate 26% faster than in the rest of the euro area.  Irish price increases in Government-regulated sectors are more than twice those in the rest of Europe.  Price increases in Irish sheltered service sectors have been close to twice the rate of the rest of Europe.  Yet price increases in Irish goods markets have been far slower than in the rest of Europe.  These trends are continuing a pattern which has prevailed for many years, during which Ireland has become one of the dearest countries in Europe.  Ireland has become a graveyard for consumers as a result of poor public policy promoted by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1913">When we look further, we begin to see what has been the main driver of inflation over the past five years.  Goods in our shops have not increased in price over that entire period.  The prices of services delivered by companies exposed to international competition have actually reduced.  Yet prices in sheltered service sectors have increased by 24%.  Does the Minister have any plans to deal with this matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_1914">The Bill puts the National Consumer Agency on a statutory basis.  In principle, the agency is needed and the Bill is long overdue.  The interim measures introduced in 2005 gave a clear indication of intent that he would put the agency on a statutory basis sooner rather than later.  Why has it taken so long?</p>
          <p eId="para_1915">The process of drafting the Bill has not had any impact on the Minister.  He must have skipped over the sections in the Bill dealing with incorrect descriptions, causing consumer confusion and providing false, misleading or deceptive information to consumers.  If he had paid heed to the spirit of these provisions in the Bill he would not have tried to pass the Bill off as the most fundamental reform of consumer law.  To present the Bill in those terms does no service to consumers or himself.  The Bill is not the fundamental reform consumers are entitled to expect from a Government, which along with its predecessor, has been in office for ten years.  It is a disappointing piece of work that has all the hallmarks of having been rushed through before the election.  I know the Minister would not agree with me on that matter either.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_1917">The Minister has been in Government for ten years and has had plenty of opportunity.  It is a hotchpotch of proposals, some of which have been foisted on the Minister by EU regulations or closing off loopholes, which could easily have been implemented long before now.  To claim the Bill is the most fundamental reform of consumer law in years is nonsense.  It transfers some powers that already existed in the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to this new agency, which I welcome — I do not believe in duplication.</p>
          <p eId="para_1918">I wish to speak about the Government's approach to consumer and competition policy.  Seldom has public administration witnessed such a disjointed, incoherent and half-hearted attempt to address specific policy considerations in such a key area.  The real problem is that the Government does not have the conviction or determination to tackle vested interests and therefore consumers get poor value, poor service and an inadequate means of address.  Section 72, which the Minister mentioned, deals with the issue of redress and on Committee Stage I will be interested to tease out how it will operate.  There is a strong sense that perhaps by his lack of speed in dealing with these matters during the past five years he may have become slightly detached from the realities and hardships facing people in their daily lives and the frustrations being experienced by consumers who had nowhere to go with legitimate complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_1919">There is one area where there is no absence of commitment on the part of the Government, that is, the establishment of regulators.  Instead of taking hard decisions in the areas of energy, transport, competition and telecommunications the Government appears content to get involved directly in its own job creation, namely, the establishment of a plethora of regulatory agencies and regulators who can operate to insulate Ministers from the heat of answering questions on the reason prices are higher.  However, they do not provide the type of competition, service or choice people expect or demand.  The output of most of the regulatory agencies is not impressive and seems to display distinct signs of regulatory capture rather than a serious commitment to the welfare of consumers.  The best example is the Commission for Energy Regulation.  These people have rolled over and have had their tummy tickled by Bord Gáis and the ESB over recent price increases only to have some rescinded later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1920">When I made representations in writing to the Commission on Energy Regulation on this matter last September I was accused of trying to advocate below cost selling.  I have not heard how one can put forward an argument about below cost selling in relation to a monopoly.  That is the type of argument we have come to expect from the Commission on Energy Regulation.  It must be reviewed.  I also question the competence and benefit of the CER in circumstances where it has presided over major price increases in energy costs to consumers and businesses with minimal new market entrants to compete with the incumbents.  The Minister is aware and is being told regularly of the difficulties businesses experience in regard to energy costs and, therefore, how it is contributing to the high cost base.</p>
          <p eId="para_1921">The Competition Authority has shown itself to be involved in the enforcement of competition law but it tends to arrive at decisions after the event.  It sets up studies and issues reports but we do not hear much afterwards.  The new chairman, Mr. Prasifka, and his team have good intentions but we do not hear anything about the tough decisions being taken that will bring dominant players in the marketplace on to an even keel to provide better choice and more competition across the various sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1922">The Competition Authority has shown a propensity to engage in long inconclusive studies which tend to produce results long after either regulations or a market have changed.  I met members of the authority in the past and while all were perfectly civil individuals I was left with the distinct impression that a quasi academic and rarefied<b> </b>atmosphere prevails in Parnell Square, which is detached from most households in Ireland.  The Competition Authority did not do itself any favour when its former chairman, Dr. Fingleton, predicted savings of €577 million to Irish consumers in respect of the grocery trade.  To his credit, the new chairman does not engage in that type of activity and he has not gone out of his way to defend the type of statement made by his predecessor.</p>

          <p eId="para_1928">Unfortunately it did not happen that way.  All the matters which have been brought to the Minister's attention by the various economists and academics have blown up in smoke and regrettably the consumer has not got the benefit.  The current chairman, Mr. Prasifka, is a more humble and modest person than his predecessor.  He does not predict such savings off the wall but does his research first.  Needless to say the outcome in all of these matters has been no reduction in food prices overall but much higher profits for the multiples.  The same applies in the insurance market.  We have very few players despite all the commitments made by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Harney, and himself, about new players in the general insurance market.  We have witnessed a levelling off of the insurance regime across employers' liability and public liability and some reduction in motor insurance but higher profits for insurance companies.  The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats policy has been to appoint more regulators and create the perception that something is happening.  Unfortunately what has happened is that there are higher profits for multiples and insurance companies and little change for consumers and less choice.  That is not good for any consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1929">The Government's policy and vision on the rights of consumers has produced a regulatory structure that is disjointed, fragmented and ultimately not very successful.  We have a plethora of agencies, commissions and authorities, all operating to their own agendas and each seemingly distant from the end users of the services they are regulating.</p>
          <p eId="para_1930">What is needed is a rationalisation of these agencies and greater co-ordination between the Competition Authority and those agencies to enforce consumer rights and which embraces the existing regulatory authorities.  There is no need for duplication of functions which can all be brought under a single or rationalised structure that has as its core focus the protection and service of consumers.  A strong consumer mandate should be the focus of these agencies but unfortunately they lack direction.  In Government I hope this is one area where Fine Gael can introduce radical reform that will benefit consumers in a real and meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1931">I welcome the decision to subsume the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs into the National Consumer Agency.  It is long overdue.  Ms Carmel Foley who was very involved with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has moved on to an important position in the public service.  She did enormous work in trying to get information out to consumers.  Regrettably, she did not have the necessary power, staff or resources to deal effectively with complaints in a modern economy.  I recall after a rugby international match in the city she and her inspectors could enter a particular establishment but unfortunately they could do nothing about enforcing the penalties.  No sooner had the inspector left than there was a lack of price displays.  This was a grey area in the legislation that did not allow her to tackle the issue head on.  I acknowledge that the Minister has increased the fine but at the time it was €127.  It would not make much difference if the pub in Dublin city was full after a rugby international as it would not take long for €127 to be clocked up in the tills.</p>
          <p eId="para_1932">I am concerned about some aspects of the Bill.  In the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, it is noted that "the detailed financial implications of establishing the new agency cannot be quantified at this stage."  I find that strange.  I expect the Minister to have an explanation in regard to the costs of the agency on Committee Stage.  I am concerned also about the operational role of the National Consumer Agency on the basis as set out and I am not critical of the executive chairperson of the agency who has been handed a difficult job by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1933">The State has a central and critical role to play in respecting consumer rights.  Unfortunately the State often deals consumers a poor hand, whether in failing to reform economic sectors in which it is dominant or in introducing changes to procedures or entitlements that negatively impact on the public as consumers of State services.  A great deal more can be done in terms of charters and the various services, or proper codes of practice or opening up areas to much more competition in many areas of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1934">All our clinics are not full of people complaining about the deal they have got from private sector companies.  Their focus is usually on State agencies, local authorities, the HSE or development agencies.  This is what the real world is about and where consumers feel hard done by.  We could play a useful role in ensuring the National Consumer Agency is armed with the necessary powers to deal with those issues effectively on behalf of clients.  If as Members of the Oireachtas we fail to get answers, how much more difficult it is for ordinary individuals and consumers? It is imperative that the public, as the consumer of these services, receives strong advice from a consumer advocate who commands authority, has the power and is well resourced.  The private sector must be focussed on equally and the State must subject itself to review and criticism and must give redress for providing poor services to the public, as consumers, of often essential services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1935">In addition to the ombudsman there must be an agency that can comment publicly and sometimes critically on State policies as they adversely impact on consumers.  I see the role of the National Consumer Agency expanded to ensure that policy perspectives are brought forward.  Sometimes we see this through the National Competitiveness Council, even though in veiled language, it might understate the type of problems we have in certain areas.  I would like to see the National Consumer Agency expressing to the Minister and Government of the day the policy changes that need to be made in respect of these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1936">I am also concerned by the fact the structure proposed under this Bill makes the National Consumer Agency so subservient to the Department and the Minister of the day.  This is wrong.  The agency should be more independent and have its own staff, resources and sources of funding.  The Minister should be able to give a block grant to the agency and let it get on with its work.  I fundamentally believe this is so important to consumers that the independence of the office will be critical to its proper function and success.</p>
          <p eId="para_1937">I also believe the Minister is giving too much power to the Department to dictate aspects of the business of the National Consumer Agency and that this will set and shape the agenda.  If the agency is going to be an effective and independent advocate for consumers, the Minister should not think that it should be anything other than independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1938">Instead of creating a watchdog, the Minister is giving consumers a neutered poodle which will be permanently tied to the railings of the Department in Kildare Street.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_1940">I am worried about what the Minister would tie the agency to.  What is even more worrying is that the Bill proposes to limit the nature of the interaction the National Consumer Agency will have with the Oireachtas.  This is an important point.  The Minister is defining the way in which the agency will interact with the Oireachtas.  Section 17(1) of the Bill states that the chief executive of the National Consumer Agency "shall, at the request in writing of an Oireachtas Committee, attend before it to give account for the general administration of the Agency as may be required by the Committee".  So by law, the chief executive of the agency will be restricted by the terms set out in the Bill to engaging with members of the Oireachtas on bland issues of general administration.  He or she will have nothing to do with policy issues as they affect consumers, legislative measures required to address inconsistencies in law or criticisms of Ministers for not doing enough to help consumers.  The Minister will forgive me if I say the agency is fine in theory but that it is not the type of watchdog we would expect it to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1941">One major concern I have about the Bill is that it openly discriminates against some of the smaller businesses that operate in the State and which form the bedrock of our enterprising economy.  There are many small businesses in the State that operate on the basis of one person or a husband and wife team.  They are small businesses which do not have big resources and often operate from the family home.  They are equally entitled to good service, fair play, not being ripped off and access to a prosecuting authority.  However, under this Bill, they are excluded.  The Bill only applies to consumers who are defined as a natural person acting for purposes unrelated to the person's trade or business.  I can think of no policy justification for excluding this section of consumers from the scope of the legislation and regard the proposal in the Bill to do so as unfair, discriminatory and anti-small business.  There is no reason inconsistent levels of consumer protection should be afforded to different segments of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1942">I am also concerned the Bill, as presented, will introduce another layer of bureaucracy and regulation, which we must avoid.  Once this Bill is enacted, we will have a number of sectors of the economy which will potentially face double regulation on consumer issues by both their sectoral regulatory authority and the National Consumer Agency.  In the Minister's contribution this evening, he referred to one such authority, the Financial Regulator.  I am certainly glad he took note of this particular problem in his contribution and I look forward to hearing the changes he will make on Committee Stage.  The last thing we want is duplication and overregulation because we already have enough.  Both the Minister and I, and I am sure other Members of the House, get a considerable number of complaints about them.  We want to see a system established that ensures we have a light rather than a heavy touch.  The financial services sector is well regulated with necessary bodies such as the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Competition Authority and the Financial Regulator.  I am interested in seeing what direction the Minister will head in respect of this issue on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1943">The telecommunications sector will face regulatory review from the National Consumer Agency, the Competition Authority and ComReg.  Before we extend the regulatory creep even further into Irish business, we need to be sure there is justification for doing so.  The Bill talks about co-operation agreements between agencies, which is fine, but in reality, the problem lies with duplicating functions without any necessity to do so.  The co-operation agreement between the Competition Authority and ComReg has proved so successful that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is giving concurrent competition enforcement powers to ComReg in the Communications Regulation Bill, against the advice of the Competition Authority.  This is an example of more bureaucracy, more disconnected thinking and more red tape in respect of ComReg.  The way we deal with consumers and telecommunications services is difficult.  I am getting many complaints about maintenance, repair, broadband roll-out and the overloaded exchanges in various parts of the country.  People are not getting the service they expect to receive from what is basically a monopoly provider of fixed lines, but ComReg has not got to grips with the rolling out of a basic service charter one would expect from a regulator at this stage in respect of telecommunications.  A total of €4.6 billion was garnered by the State from the sale of Eircom.  Eircom has been sold twice since then and we are still no better off in terms of competition, service provision or the roll-out of broadband.  We are slowly getting there, but it is too slow for an awful lot of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1944">At a time when the rest of Europe is contracting its regulatory overlay of the national economies, we in Ireland are proposing to introduce yet another layer of bureaucracy and duplication.  This does no favours to our economy or the international perception of Ireland as a place to do business.  Most importantly, it does no favours to consumers who find themselves betwixt and between regulatory agencies with seemingly common functions and all funded by the higher costs for services caused by an increased regulatory burden.  The Minister needs to go back to the drawing board on this on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1945">For the past two years, Fine Gael has called for a consumer rights enforcer.  In principle, this Bill goes towards meeting this objective.  What we need to see is an agency with real power which will root out blockages to competition and ensure consumers get the fair deal they deserve.  Under our proposals, the new body would have the same status as an ombudsman and would cut the umbilical cord with Departments that are largely pulled around the place in respect of vested interests.  It will be a proactive champion, watchdog, defender and advocate of consumers' rights and interests.  A key feature of the office will be its independence.  To be really effective, it needs to be a stand-alone office with its own stall and a secure budget.  It should be a proactive champion and a meaningful watchdog for consumers.  In addition, the National Consumer Agency should be in a position to conduct regular price surveys that highlight good value and name and shame those charging excessive prices and to regularly create a price league website with tables on all major products to give the best possible information to consumers.  This has been done in respect of the financial services sector and I compliment Mary O'Dea, the consumer director in the Irish Financial Service Regulatory Authority, which carries out regular surveys on financial products.  This needs to be extended into a wider range of products that affect consumers and their purchasing power.  We must develop codes of conduct for service providers and retailers on issues like passing on exchange rate movements, devise and promote a good practice provider quality mark for suppliers of goods and services that agree to be bound by relevant codes of practice and work with local authorities through the directors of community and enterprise sections to drive a pro-consumer agenda at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1946">If we drill down to local authority level and make more use of this organisation, we could provide much more information to consumers at a more local level.  We often believe that when we say something at national level or put an advertisement in the national newspapers, it is enough.  I am sure the National Consumer Agency will have a budget for advertising, marketing and information campaigns, but we must drill down to an agency at local level.  Perhaps, the local authority is a vehicle for doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1947">Consumers should be represented in national partnership agreements and be part of any national agreement.  It is clear that, in many instances, recent agreements have been dominated by the producers, not consumers.  We need an agency that will not tolerate cartels, monopolies or anti-competitive practices that hurt consumers but will fundamentally give them choice, reduce prices and, in competitive terms, bring more people into the marketplace.  That is why Fine Gael is committed to introducing defined time limits for different stages of Competition Authority investigations, in order to address concerns about the length of time investigations take.  It is important complainants would be kept regularly informed of the progress of an investigation.  We should instruct the Competition Authority to issue an annual report on the implications of State action on competition.  Such a report would be able to identify how the State has inhibited or prevented competition and be able to make suggestions about the changes required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1948">Our system of regulators is creaking and ineffective.  We should merge existing regulators so as to have fewer of them and provide a more important role for the Competition Authority to work with them.  They should be charged with controlling costs and opening sheltered parts of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1949">In principle, the Bill is much to be commended but the powers vested in the agency by the Minister to ensure consumers can have confidence in it are inadequate.  The Consumer Protection Agency should be independent like an ombudsman.  I intend to table the necessary amendments on Committee Stage to give effect to these principles and the proposals outlined in my contribution.</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_1950">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill which the Labour Party does not oppose.  However, while we welcome a number of elements in it, there is much scope for amendment on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1951">Consumer protection has never been more important than is currently the case.  This week in the UK, for instance, banks have conceded defeat in the face of an organised campaign by hundreds of thousands of consumers claiming refunds of banking fees which exceeded the legal maximum allowed under UK consumer law.  One estimate reckons UK bank customers are due refunds equivalent to €14 billion, which is a substantial amount of money to be repaid because somebody was not doing his or her job properly or because he or she was ignoring consumer rights.  Our banks have a less than perfect record in attending to the rights of consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1952">UK consumers, however, are not the only ones who are being deceived.  One of my favourite topics in this regard relates to food labelling and safety issues.  Time and again in this House I have raised the issue of food which is produced outside Ireland that can be quite legally labelled as being "Irish" even though, for instance, only breadcrumbs may have been added to the original product after it was imported.  This is called substantial transformation and it is entirely legal.  The point at issue is that the meat content, for example chicken fillets, may have come from Thailand, South America or elsewhere.  When such products are imported to Ireland, the addition of seasoning or spices can lead to it being labelled as "Irish".  As far as consumers are concerned, the only information they have on the packet is that the product is Irish.  That is definitely misleading.  I accept this is the case across the European Union but I would like to see it changed.  I welcome the Bill because it should take account of this kind of issue.  Consumer protection in regard to food safety and nutrition is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1953">I note most of the Bill is an almost verbatim copy of EU Directive 2005/29/EC, which it is intended to transpose.  Part 2 of the Bill aims to establish a National Consumer Agency.  I am saddened by today's news that the Director of Corporate Enforcement has been unsuccessfully seeking sufficient staff to do its job for two years.  It is not enough for Government merely to establish agencies like the National Consumer Agency; it must also resource them properly.  I take heart, however, from the fact that should the Bill pass, it may well be implemented by another Government.  If that is the case, we would ensure adequate resourcing was provided for the agency.  It is pointless to set up agencies and not provide adequate funding for facilities etc. to allow them to deliver on their mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1954">Section 8 of the Bill gives the National Consumer Agency a number of functions.  I note in particular the agency may "make recommendations to the Government...in relation to any proposals for legislative change".  I note also it shall promote alternative dispute resolution, commission research, promote educational initiatives in the area of consumer education, prepare and publish guidelines for traders, in addition to any number of other powers.  I welcome all of these proposals but one can well ask whether the Government is committed to resourcing the agency properly so it can carry out these functions.  I am not sure that will be the case because of the history of the lack of resources for many other agencies, for example, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The catering trade is expected to indicate to us the country of origin of beef.  When one asks how many inspections have been carried out, the reply is "very few", and when one asks how many have complied with those inspections, the answer is also "very few".  The bottom line is the authority is not adequately resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1955">Part 3 deals with unfair and misleading commercial practices.  Its scope is wide enough to include a number of situations in which consumers are being misled by unfair or misleading commercial practices.  I commend the European Parliament for being responsible, as I understand it, for initiating the EU directive which this part of the Bill transposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1956">I wish to concentrate on section 43 which states, "A commercial practice is misleading if it includes the provision of false information" in regard to a number of factors including the geographical origin of a product.  It further states, a commercial practice would be misleading under the terms of the Bill if this false information "would be likely to cause the average consumer...to make a transactional decision that the average consumer would not otherwise make".</p>
          <p eId="para_1957">Section 43(7) states: "In determining the geographical origin of goods . . . consideration shall be given to where the goods underwent their last substantial and economically justified processing . . . resulting in the manufacture of new goods or representing an important stage of the manufacture or production".  This brings me back to my point about substantial transformation.  In many cases when one buys a product in a supermarket that to all intents and purposes is pretending to be Irish, when one investigates, if one is able to do so — for the most part one is not — one discovers the raw material was imported but the processed element of it is Irish which led to its being labelled an Irish product.  This is a significantly misleading approach to labelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1958">Other issues of concern arise in regard to the labelling of food.  One often comes across what I consider to be sleight of hand labelling.  For example, in regard to salmon one comes across "Irish smoked salmon" and "Smoked Irish salmon".  One is not sure whether the salmon or the smoke is Irish or where the salmon came from to create this product.  While this is technically acceptable and legal, it is definitely misleading because one would take it from the word "Irish" that the product was produced and processed in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1959">The labelling of poultry arises frequently in discussions of this nature.  This issue affects consumers and commercial producers because, much of the time, they are competing on an unfair playing field with imported products.  However, I welcome the introduction of sanctions under section 43 of the Bill for producers who label their product with false information.  The categories of practice set out as misleading include, "its benefits or fitness for purpose", "the results to be expected from it", "the risks it presents to consumers", or due to "the results of tests or checks carried out on it".</p>
          <p eId="para_1960">Another issue I have raised previously in the House about food labelling is the question of guideline daily allowances, GDA, versus the traffic light labelling of food products.  Under the GDA method of labelling products, which most major supermarket groups favour, a consumer is told on the label what percentage of certain categories of ingredients the product contributes to one's recommended daily intake of each ingredient.  In effect, one is being told this is the appropriate percentage for one's daily intake.  For example, according to the GDA system, a chocolate bar might say on its label that eating this chocolate bar would contribute 100% of one's daily recommended allowance of fat.  On the other hand, the traffic-light food labelling system favoured by Deputy Naughten and I, advises the use of a simple red, orange or green colour coded labels.  It tells whether a product should be taken with care or, if the label is green, it can be eaten with abandon.  It is a simple and straightforward system, but the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not in favour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1961">Of 17,000 UK consumers recently surveyed, 80% preferred traffic light food labelling to GDA labels.  The British National Heart Forum finds the GDA system complicated and misleading and the British Medical Association is in favour of the traffic light system of labelling.  The argument is made by these substantial bodies.  The UK Food Standards Agency states that the evidence so far is that consumers are not running scared of red markers, as feared by critics of the traffic light scheme.  They are using the information to balance their shop.  They are not interpreting red as a sign not to buy the product.  They interpret it as "high in fat, salt or sugar" and know that they should not eat too much of the product.</p>
          <p eId="para_1962">Research has found that one of the major problems with the GDA system is that many people do not have the mathematical ability to use the percentages constructively.  One mother stated that her priority at the supermarket is making sure she does not lose her child, not choosing a good cereal.  A person on a low salt diet might see a product with a low percentage of salt, which is a good thing.  Another product might express this as sodium or sodium chloride, which is not the same.  There is a need for consumer information, consumer education and consistency of labelling to ensure that the correct information can be easily interpreted by the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1963">Another problem with the GDA is the sample size of products.  This is not standardised.  One carton of yoghurt may state that 100g will provide 20% of GDA of fat.  The carton beside it may refer to 30g providing 15% of GDA of fat.  If the priority is minding the child in the supermarket one will probably choose the second product even though the former is healthier.  One has to work out the mathematics but these matters should be kept simple.  The traffic light food labelling system might show both yoghurts as amber or the latter on red and the former on green.  This is uncomplicated.  The average hard-pressed consumer would not be misled by the traffic light labels but would be misled by the GDA system.  Many people find the current indication of nutritional content misleading, yet it is legal.  The Bill should encompass issues such as misleading food labels.  It is a major issue, given our concerns about healthy eating, obesity and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1964">The Minister for Agriculture and Food is reported to be opposed to the traffic light labelling system, apparently because she feels it would be bad for producers of high fat cheese.  I have asked her to conduct research into Irish consumers' perceptions of traffic light labelling but she has refused.  If she did, she would discover that Irish consumers would not be dissuaded from buying a high fat cheese with a red label but would buy lesser quantities or choose another with a lower fat content.  There is no threat to the consumption of the product or the industry.  We can provide the consumer with appropriate information.  If a product is high in fat one should monitor the amount one consumes.  Just because it is a dairy product we should not shy away from labelling it as a high fat product.  We must be straightforward about these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1965">If the Government refuses to legislate to allow for traffic light food labelling it should introduce regulations, using the powers in section 48(3), which set out the conditions under which the GDA labels would not be deemed misleading.  A statutory instrument could be introduced to oblige all manufacturers to use the same sample product size in the GDA label.  This would stop the use of misleading GDA labels.  Nothing short of a traffic light labelling system, such as Fine Gael and the Labour Party will introduce in Government, will prevent consumers from being misled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1966">I refer to dangerous and misleading information about diets and slimming aids.  One sees wonderful advice in diet books and products that promise weight loss.  It is not only misleading but dangerous.  This must be addressed to stop the gullible from believing that they will lose a major amount of weight.  If that worked, we would be skinny, healthy and fit without any effort.  One finds the same information in fitness clubs where one is promised weight loss after a 14-day programme.  This is also misleading and potentially dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1967">Section 53 relates to prohibited commercial practices and I welcome section 53(3) <i>(e)</i>  which prohibits advertisements which directly exhort children to “(i) purchase a product, or (ii) persuade a parent or adult to purchase the product for them;”  That might be difficult to enforce.  The Government should be congratulated but it should be noted that the provision is taken from an EU directive of 2005.  I commend the European Parliament for initiating that section of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1968">I have previously raised the matter of pyramid schemes.  People are ripped off and lose vast amounts of money and there are various knock-on effects.  The Labour Party published a Bill on this practice some years ago and there has been a rash of pyramid schemes since.  Many people suffer financial and personal losses from the rows that arise from the scheme.  The moral is that if something looks too good to be true, it most likely is.  This is another case of clever people exploiting vulnerable people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1969">I welcome the section that deals with aggressive selling.  We all know elderly people living alone who have been browbeaten into buying a service or product they do not want.  They are intimidated and are sometimes brought to the bank to get cash to hand over.  This area must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1970">I also raised the matter of ringtones with the Minister and the difficulty of getting out of it once one buys into it.  This practice targets people who do not know what they are buying.  It is not clear that one cannot get rid of the ringtone once one pays for it and downloads it.  I devoted much time to attempting to reverse this but it was very difficult because it operates from outside Ireland.  Children, and teenagers in particular, are taken by the latest ringtone and must have it.  Once they buy into it there is a cost every time it is downloaded and one cannot get rid of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1971">Although I do not know how it could be addressed in this Bill, the matter of so-called psychics should also be considered.  They advertise and rip people off.  Mr. Derren Browne is a magician and explains in his books how psychics work.  Apart from the financial aspect of the rip off, they target people who are vulnerable and this specific matter should be examined.  Much of the Bill is to be welcomed.  It is not right for the Government to take the credit for helping the consumer not only because the Bill's contents are identical to the aforementioned EU directive which is as it should be but also because this is the least consumer-friendly Government.  For instance, it allowed the energy regulator to impose a 23% hike in gas prices, notwithstanding the reduction in world fuel prices.  Deputy Hogan has already addressed this point.  It has driven price increases that have let inflation break the 5% barrier.  Annual inflation is now at a six year high of 5.2%.  When we were last in Government inflation was at 1.5%.  The removal of the groceries order has led to a downward spiral in the cost of alcohol.  Consumers plagued by anti-social behaviour associated with people consuming cheap alcohol will not be overly impressed with this decline.  That is not a consumer friendly move.  Since the abolition of the groceries order food prices have gone up.</p>

          <p eId="para_1975">Irish banks get away with murder.  The average cost of a credit card is €105 whereas the average across Europe is €65, indicating a significant mark up here.  The cost of taking out a loan here is almost twice the EU average while Irish consumers pay €100 for current accounts.  These costs are often not obvious to the consumer as he or she buys into various financial packages.  The Government has done very little to contain or control this activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1976">I would like the Bill to take account of management companies.  They have been a major issue for many who have bought houses and paid large sums to management companies for very poor delivery or none.  The Labour Party put forward some sensible proposals recently that we would like the Minister to take on board.  The lack of control of management companies and the failure to implement any relevant legislation has caused much grief for victims of bad management companies.  Some management companies deliver the service and work well on behalf of their clients but unfortunately we have received many complaints about bad management, no delivery of service and no concern for the householder.  This is a serious problem that must be addressed in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1977">The key to the implementation and effectiveness of this Bill is how well the consumer benefits from it.  In order for the consumer to benefit we must fill the information and education gap.  This could be achieved through the resources of citizen information centres.  Many consumers are unaware of their rights.  The legislation will help but unless the consumer knows about his or her rights and is able to ask the right question it will be of no use.</p>
          <p eId="para_1978">There seems to be a plethora of agencies with various responsibilities and there is a danger of creating one more that will overlap with, duplicate and dilute the resources we so badly need.  The proof of how consumer friendly this legislation is will lie in how well it is resourced and enforced.  I noted the example highlighted today of the Director of Corporate Enforcement pleading for funds to enable him to perform his statutory duty.  I would not like to see this experience repeated but would like to think that this new agency will be adequately resourced, the personnel will be provided, the support services will be in place and that it can be effective and deliver.  I hope the introduction of this Bill will be effective but to judge by the past performance of the Government on consumer concerns there may be no delivery on it.</p>

        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_405">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1979">I wish to share time with my colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I generally welcome this Bill but despite its introduction and the proposal to set up this agency, consumer protection stands lower in Government priorities than it should do.  While it is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment it does not feature in the title of his Department.  It occupies a debatable place in the Department's objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1980">The Green Party's national convention was addressed by Renate Künast, a former Minister for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture in the Green-SPD government in Germany.  The greatest consumer interest is in food, followed by other types of goods and access to services.  Other European democracies deal with that by having government briefs that properly reflect that interest.  We should perhaps debate not the establishment of a more focused and stronger National Consumer Agency but how consumer protection and relations are viewed as a priority of Government.  I hope that when we go to the hustings in a few weeks this will become an important issue and remain so for whoever forms part of the next Government and that there will be a Department for consumer protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1981">The Green Party will not argue against the concept of a stronger and more focused consumer agency.  The problem is to what extent does this form an effective rationalisation of consumer agencies, or will there remain several overlapping and conflicting agencies to help consumers seek effective redress under legislation that does not yet exist?  How good a consumer advocate will this new agency be?  The Minister must address the conflict in his brief of Enterprise, Trade and Employment if we are to have a Department that is more focused on consumer protection.  It is rather like an episode of "Yes Minister" because the Minister should represent the interests of his Department at Cabinet but there is a conflict in those interests between representing producers and consumers.  No one could play that role effectively.  That is why we must address the role of consumer protection in Government rather than establish this type of agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1982">I noted Deputy Upton's interest in labelling.  There are many issues to be tackled in respect of how food products are labelled.  There has been some progress on this in recent years, for example, the listing of ingredients and whether that is done in a user-friendly format.  Health implications, however, need to be more clearly labelled on many food products.  Consumers are growing more aware of how and where a product is produced but environmental concepts are not addressed on labelling.  The new agency could consider a labelling requirement for food miles in particular.</p>

An organisation called Saoirse has been working for the past 12 years to achieve the important goal of opening a refuge in Tallaght for women and children escaping violence in the home.  People who supported the organisation over the years considered it a much needed service given that there are only two other refuges in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">In my role as a public representative, a member of the health board from 1994 and as the founding chairperson of the south-western area health board, I, with other colleagues, strongly supported this group.  Over the years it made much progress, although its members will confirm that they had many struggles and overcame many obstacles in that period.  However, they pointed out that this brought them closer together and strengthened their determination to succeed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country so one would expect problems.  I often remarked that it was not right that, like other communities, we should send our problems on the bus into the centre of the city to be resolved.  That was the case with a number of problems, including drug addiction.  I am pleased that in the past year Saoirse was able to announce that it had secured premises with the help of South Dublin County Council.  It has now opened a women's refuge in Tallaght village with the financial assistance of the HSE, which appointed a manager last January and worked with the board of management on adapting the building and sourcing additional funding.  The refuge was officially opened by President McAleese several weeks ago.  I welcome that development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">It was a difficult journey for Saoirse to final success.  I was present at the opening of the refuge.  It has six units, which are full.  The organisation is already looking for more space to accommodate the average of two families a day it is obliged to turn away.  In the many briefings Saoirse has given me it has pointed out that the issue of funding for domestic violence services is a major concern.  It has had to struggle and prove the need for funding to run the services instead of being given dedicated funding from a dedicated section within a Department.  The organisation has asked me to express the delight of the community that this facility has been opened in Tallaght.  It is open to families from all over the country who are in need of a safe refuge from violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">The members of Saoirse tell me that their goal is to see the day that sufferers of domestic violence are not forced to leave their homes because of the abuse perpetrated on them and where the abuser should have to be accountable for his or her behaviour.  They are operating an outreach service for women in the community with whom they can work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1991">I wish to be sensitive about this subject.  As is the case with my colleagues, many people who are affected by this problem come to me about it.  I am happy to compliment the proposers of this motion and to speak up for the women's refuge in Tallaght.  Saoirse was anxious that I do that.  Like other people providing such services, they find it difficult to get the message across to the agencies as to who should fund them.  That is a challenge for everybody.</p>

            <from>Mr. Ó Fearghaíl</from>
            <p eId="para_1992">I thank Deputy O'Connor for sharing time with me.  The refuge in Kildare has not yet opened so I cannot wax lyrical about the situation.  However, I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to this debate on domestic violence, and to support the Government's amendment.  Like Deputy O'Connor, I congratulate our Sinn Féin colleagues for proposing this motion as it highlights a most serious problem in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">Domestic violence is not just an Irish phenomenon.  The World Health Organisation, in a report in 2005, described domestic violence as the most common form of violence in women's lives.  The international experience is that a woman is statistically more likely to be abused by a partner than by a stranger or casual acquaintance.  The same disturbing report suggests that women are more at risk of assault in the home than on the street.</p>
            <p eId="para_1994">The National Crime Council study, concluded in conjunction with the ESRI, gives us the most recent relevant Irish data, which suggests that nearly one in seven women, and about 6% of men, have experienced serious sexual, mental, or physical abuse in a domestic setting.  The same report identified a strong pattern of non-disclosure on the part of the victims, with 33% failing to discuss their abuse or torture with either family or friends.  From experience in my constituency work, it appears that the persistent male abuser, more often than not, manages to isolate his victimised partner from family and friends, lest she would overcome the shame which many women experience when beset by this crime against them and confide in somebody.</p>
            <p eId="para_1995">When one considers the veil of secrecy and shame which all too often hides the damage done to individuals and children, as a result of domestic violence, we can appreciate the vital work that is done by groups such as Women's Aid, which recently made an impressive presentation to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  Women's Aid, through its national free phone helpline, provides what amounts to a genuine lifeline to many abused women.  Its one-to-one confidential support and advocacy service is vital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">The Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime provided €270,000 to groups, such as Women's Aid, which provide accompaniment services to women going to court in cases such as these.  This type of service is absolutely necessary and should continue to receive the required funding, as it is only when the victims are prepared to go to court that the perpetrators can finally be brought to account for their dastardly and cowardly deeds.  One stunning statistic emerges when considering this issue. Women who find the courage to report domestic violence against them are 70% more likely to experience worse assaults in the aftermath of such disclosure.  This international statistic poses a real challenge that goes beyond politics and government to how society can protect some of its most vulnerable members.  Women's groups have asked for the legislation in this area to be strengthened.  Notwithstanding the merits of the Domestic Violence Acts, there is considerable merit in the suggestion that the legislation should be revisited in examining in detail how safety orders and barring orders are applied so they may have more widespread application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1997">The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, set out the considerable work and variety of initiatives engaged in by the Garda Síochána in the battle against domestic violence.  It is generally acknowledged that the force has a comprehensive policy in place.  Despite this, women's groups have reported that not all experiences are positive and the force's pro-arrest policy is not always implemented.  Equally worrying are the figures which suggest that while the incidents of domestic violence reported to the Women's Aid helpline increased by 37% between 2003 and 2005, the level of such reporting to the Garda decreased by 35%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">One key aim of the Government is to heighten public awareness of the dreadful crime of domestic violence.  We must strive to insure there is a consistently high level of awareness of the problem within the Garda and an equally consistent application of best practice in the area.  It is worth noting that a 1999 Law Society report found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that there was a considerable variation among judges in their approach to aspects of this crime and the evidence they deemed sufficient to grant a protection order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">Children who witness violence in the home are seeing, hearing and learning about violence.  Research has shown that children who see domestic violence in their life carry a greater risk of being either a victim or a perpetrator of domestic violence in their adult life, thus continuing the cycle of domestic violence.  Domestic violence causes a range of symptoms in a child, such as poor interpersonal skills, low self-esteem, eating disorders, a reduction in cognitive ability and severe lack of sleep.  Children can feel guilty, believing they are the direct cause of the violence, and can feel inadequate about not being able to prevent the violence from happening.  More profoundly, children in such circumstances can sometimes resort to acts of violence themselves, through acts of aggression and bullying in and outside the school.  The Department of Education and Science has a key role to play in addressing the problem by including in its SPHE programmes modules that address the culture of anger and violence, which can dominate some intimate partner relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <speech by="#DennisODonovan" eId="spk_410">
            <from>Mr. O’Donovan</from>
            <p eId="para_2001">I thank my Sinn Féin colleagues for putting down the motion on this important issue.  Society has changed for the worse in the past 40 years.  My father had a saying, "Whatever strife stirs abroad, there should be peace at home".  Unfortunately this does not resonate through as much as it used to.  Despite the high level campaigns in the media against domestic violence and the efforts of various Departments, incidents of domestic violence have increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_2002">While most cases of domestic violence are against women, it must be remembered that men too can be victims, not often physically but emotionally.  It must also be remembered that in many cases of domestic violence, it can be the emotional psyching out of a partner.  The damage caused to the adult can be minuscule when compared to the effect it can have on children who are exposed to it.  Those who experienced violence in the home as children are more likely to be violent and abusive in adult life.</p>
            <p eId="para_2003">In most towns, women's groups are supported through small grants from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide a service at local level.  Sheltered accommodation can be found not only in Cork and Dublin but on the Beara Peninsula or the Sheep's Head Peninsula.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">From my experience as a lawyer, 20 years ago the Judiciary's skill and training in dealing with barring orders, interim orders and so forth virtually did not exist.  In the past decade, a new breed of judges has come to the fore who are astute in handling situations of domestic violence.  In most cases, judges will not take a risk and grant an interim order or a barring order quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2005">I compliment the Garda training college in Templemore in the strides it made in training gardaí in handing domestic violence cases.  Some 25 years ago, gardaí called to domestic violence situations did not know how to handle them.  Recently, in a case in the Cork South-West constituency, the woman affected described the gardaí involved as understanding, knowledgeable of the law and how to deal with the abusing partner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2006">Despite all the moneys allocated to tackling the problem and all the training given to the Garda and Judiciary, unless the mindset that sees it as acceptable in society changes, there will be no short-term solution to domestic violence.  This can be addressed through education at both primary and secondary level.  Victims will often speak of the shame and embarrassment of it and how they were afraid to come forward.  Forty years ago, people thought domestic violence was acceptable.  In more recent years, through education, most people see it as unacceptable under any circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2007">Hopefully, arising from this debate, the issue of domestic violence will be tackled further.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CeciliaKeaveney" eId="spk_411">
            <from>Cecilia Keaveney</from>
            <p eId="para_2008">I wish briefly to add my voice on this extremely serious issue.  I agree with the amendment affirming that domestic violence is a heinous crime and a cruel wrong that affects the safety and welfare of vulnerable people in the home, including children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2009">Domestic violence is much more prevalent than many people realise, unless they have themselves been touched by it first-hand.  Many believe that violence is seen in the form of broken bones and bruising.  As Chair of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I too have heard first-hand at its meetings the reality that such violence can be very subtle and go far beyond injuring spouses or partners physically on parts of their body exposed to public view.  People often assume that if one cannot see evidence on the victim's face, it cannot be happening.  Such violence can consist of bullying and intimidation, be verbal, psychological, financial, sexual or take some other form.  It is all geared towards undermining the confidence of the victim and exerting control.</p>
            <p eId="para_2010">I wish to raise awareness of the fact that alcohol consumption contributes significantly to marital discord and related child welfare difficulties and domestic violence.  The committee's recent report, The Inclusion of Alcohol in a National Substance Misuse Strategy, refers to the fact that one Irish marriage-counselling service reported that problem drinking was the primary issue in up to 25% of cases each year.  That cannot continue to be considered in any way normal or acceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2011">As an aside, I ask that the Minister inform his counterpart, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that the family law backlog in Donegal must be addressed.  Current delays are causing deeper anxiety, hurt and difficulties where separations are contentious.</p>
            <p eId="para_2012">I do not want to come across as a killjoy, since I enjoy a drink as much as anyone, but alcohol is literally killing the joy in many houses through adults, and sometimes their children, abusing it.  The nature of the information we received in compiling our report was quite staggering but is unfortunately not unusual.  The suggestion that violent alcoholic partners, usually men, might encourage their spouse or partner to drink and thus allow the shame of alcohol dependence to lessen the other's chances of leaving with the children was a serious finding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2013">We will publish two more reports on 26 March.  It was very clearly seen that a child's relationships, particularly a girl's relationship with her father, play a very significant part in whether he or she turns to drink or drugs.  Therefore, parental role models and how we address or ignore issues are very important.  I was very proud of the recent Inishowen Women's Outreach ten-year celebrations, proving how right they were to form and push for services.  Their work, not only in a voluntary capacity but with the HSE, county council and gardaí, means they are making very significant inroads into the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">Being honest, I said to them at the recent celebrations that a small service in a local rural community would not work and that people experiencing domestic violence would not come forward with a problem at such a parochial level.  I congratulate them now as then that they have proven me wrong.  Statistics are there to back up the service, which is provided in a very rural area of only approximately 30,000 people.  From January to June 2006, some 879 people used the helpline, with 204 repeat contacts and 250 service-users.</p>
            <p eId="para_2015">I want mainstreaming funding for the service, whose part-time support worker carries a very heavy burden, despite a great level of volunteering, and it is dependent on annual financing.  They currently operate on approximately €23,000, when even €100,000 would be challenging in the context of running the best service.  Given the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey's, excellent work to increase the budget nationally, I trust that their case will be examined sympathetically and fully endorse the value of their work.  Alongside Letterkenny Women's Refuge and the Rape Crisis Centre, they provide invaluable support in our county and community.  It is too bad that we need a service to address domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">We must look to the causes of the problem and address the elephant in the living room, which is alcohol.  I speak not of its use but of its abuse, its place in our culture, in celebrations or commiseration, its infiltration through almost exclusive sponsorship of major and local sporting events, and the reality of marriage breakdown, mental health problems, accident-and-emergency statistics, road deaths and so forth.  I could go on for quite some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">I commend the bravery of those who come forward and the voluntary work being done in many areas.</p>

            <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_2020">I welcome the motion and congratulate the Sinn Féin Deputies on tabling it.  The issue not only requires careful, thoughtful suggestions such as those made in the motion but much broader debate, including in this House.  The opportunity to debate this is extremely important, since it is one of the most important societal issues but is seldom aired sufficiently.  Those who can make an impact and achieve change must hear the full consequences of what is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_2021">Domestic violence is a simple phrase, but it has a truly horrific meaning and impact for thousands of Irishwomen, as well as men and children.  I was interested in Deputy O'Donovan's comments on the good old days.  They were not all that good, and at least now the domestic oppression of people is much more visible.  Previously, women in particular thought it their lot to be beaten, abused, and relegated to second-class status.  Often, their abuse was not only from husbands, since children were taught to have less than full respect for their mothers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">In recent years we have made important strides, but we have a long way to go.  Domestic violence affects women especially, but that is not exclusively the case, and there are various types of violence.  Emotional and psychological violence can on occasion be even more damaging and oppressive than a physical blow.  The facts laid out in the motion are genuinely shocking and demand a careful and comprehensive response, particularly when one thinks of women dying violently.  Some 126 women have been violently killed since 1996.  Some 81 were killed in their own homes, and just under 50% of victims whose cases were concluded were killed by their partner or ex-partner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">That is frightening, but the facts laid out in the motion are not the end of the story.  I will add some more disturbing statistics.  One in six survivors of sexual violence will become an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital at some point.  In contrast, the figure is one in 46 among those not to have been sexually abused.  Compared with 20 other European countries, Ireland has the highest number of cases of sexual violence such as rape falling out of the system before adjudication by the courts.  In 2005, some 25,843 calls were made to the Women's Aid national helpline.  However, the organisation was unable to respond to 10,000 of them owing to a lack of staff and resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">In 2004, some 1,144 women and 1,333 children fleeing domestic violence were refused emergency refuge accommodation in the Eastern Health Board region alone owing to a dearth of facilities.  These statistics are from the Women's Aid Safety and Sanctions report.  Research has found that only between 1% and 6% of domestic violence offenders in Ireland receive a prison sentence.  That means that between 94% and 99% of such violent offenders never see the inside of a prison cell.  General racism and discrimination against Travellers constitute a significant barrier to Traveller women accessing support services.  We must be cognisant of that fact and do something about it.   What can we do about such issues?  The motion outlines some courses of action.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">I am indebted to the Labour Women's National Council for its work.  It has a close relationship with the voluntary sector in dealing with domestic violence in general and violence against women in particular.  The council came up with a ten point plan and I will outline some of its elements to the House.  It called for the immediate funding of front-line services to ensure that all women in Ireland, and all men, who are victims of sexual violence can access appropriate services.  These include national telephone helplines, supported advocacy services, counselling on rape and sexual assault and, very importantly, court accompaniment.  Being a victim is often the loneliest position in Irish courts.  The accused has legal representation and the State is obviously well represented in presenting its case, but the victim often does not have the required support.</p>
            <p eId="para_2026">The council also called for the provision of refuges as an essential specialist intervention for individuals — men, women or children — fleeing the perpetrators of domestic violence.  It has called for the ending, as a matter of urgency, of reliance on bed and breakfast provision as a response to domestic violence.  Women and children should not be required to stay in bed and breakfast establishments, following which they are expected to walk the streets during the daytime.  That is not an adequate response.</p>
            <p eId="para_2027">The council called for the scope of the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency to be expanded from the current pilot programme to a sustained nationwide programme ensuring integration and co-ordination of agency interventions in domestic violence with civil and criminal justice systems, and the application of best international practice.  It is shameful that we came close to having that agency's pilot programme closed down.  Thankfully, however, some measure of relief has now been given to allow the agency to continue its important work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">The council called for the expansion of dedicated statutory services, including specialist violence-against-women social work interventions, sexual assault treatment units or SATUs, and the application of SATU best practice guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2029">We need to address the power and resource inequality that currently exists in the criminal justice system between plaintiffs and defendants in cases of rape and sexual assault, through comprehensive reform of the legal system.  We need to have appropriate training in dealing with cases of violence and sexual assault against women for members of the Judiciary.  The same training should be provided to court staff as is currently beginning to be provided to garda cadets.  We need to address the issue of vulnerable sectors of the community, including Travellers, immigrants, ethnic minorities and the disabled who are often victims of sexual violence.  They should always be provided with the necessary support so that, in the first instance, they can reach out for help.  This is particularly the case for people who suffer from any intellectual disability.  Such supports are haphazard at present and need to be strengthened and provided as a matter of form.  We need a dedicated integration and support funding mechanism to resource the application of a national strategy.  I understand that a national women's strategy is to be published shortly but all its elements should be properly and adequately resourced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2030">The ten-minute slot allocated to me is extremely limited and inadequate to begin to do justice to an issue of national importance.  We should all be cognisant of the sometimes silent suffering of many thousands of our citizens trapped in abusive relationships, in households were they feel economically vulnerable and cannot reach out.  Bolt-holes for such people must be resourced so that in every community refuges are provided to which people — predominantly women, but sometimes men — can flee with children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2031">This is a wake-up for the Oireachtas to deal with the issue as a matter of urgency and priority.  From the Labour Party's perspective, I make a public commitment that these issues will be high on our agenda, not only in the run up to the next election but also, hopefully, when Labour forms part of the next Government.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_415">
            <from>Ms McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_2032">I thank Deputy Howlin for sharing his time slot.  I will begin with a quote from Women's Aid in the report of the Women's Health Council, as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2033">Violence against women in the home is a complex issue which is deeply rooted in gender-based power relations.  It is socially constructed and reinforced by cultural, economic and social factors.  Any systematic attempt to eliminate violence in the home therefore must be multi-dimensional and address the issue at different levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">That statement clearly calls for a strategic and comprehensive Government response.  The Government, however, has taken a rather curious approach which is not solely related to this issue.  It governs for five years and then sets about publishing a strategy when it is going to the people.  The Government did that on health in 2002, just before the last election, producing what turned out to be a fairy-tale fabrication of a health strategy.  It now looks as if it will do the same concerning the national women's strategy, whereby just before the election such a strategy will be published, hey presto, by the end of March.  That is a cynical approach and I hope that this time around, the electorate will understand that it is nothing more than window dressing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">We have a serious issue of domestic violence in Ireland and the statistics have been well aired by other speakers.  Despite additional funding — and I acknowledge there have been improvements in that regard — we still have a core level of domestic violence that is unacceptable and dangerous.  It will have a long-lasting generational impact.  We know that children model their behaviour on what they learn from the domestic environment in which they grow up.  Almost one in five Irish women experience domestic violence at the moment.  It occurs in all socio-economic groups and is not restricted to any particular class.  It is not just about physical violence because there are various forms of psychological abuse and terror tactics that can be very frightening.  In such cases, even though no marks are left on the body, the psyche can be damaged and people are vulnerable as a consequence of multi-faceted abuse that often characterises domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2036">In the 1980s, I was one of the founders of the Bray women's refuge.  In those days, there were no such refuges, apart from the one in Dublin.  The Bray refuge was established by women supporting other women, without necessarily having any resources to back up what we were doing.  We were not professionals but we understood the desperate need for such a refuge.  We also had a plan to make the refuge redundant, whereby at some future point there would no longer be a need for it in Bray.  Far from reaching that goal, we now have a refuge that is highly professional, well resourced, and bigger and better than anything we could have provided.  Regrettably, however, it is not big enough.  The Bray refuge has to turn away more people than it accommodates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2037">The problem continues therefore and, if anything, the complexity of the issues involved is growing.  The growth of the Internet has brought risks, particularly for children.  In discussing domestic violence, we must also acknowledge the issue of violence against children, their sexualisation at a very early age and the extent of violence in pornography, all of which feed into a culture of violence and aggression that can be damaging to vulnerable people, particularly women and children.  People are shocked at the recent allegations about a paedophile ring and a 14 year old boy.  Senator Kathleen O'Meara on her concerns said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2038">In this technological age, in the era of the internet, mobile phones, text messages and e-mails, parents feel their children are extremely vulnerable to the approaches and advances of abusers.  In such a climate the under-resourcing of the Garda central vetting unit to examine the suitability of all those in the public service to work with children, whether it be with the very young in child care facilities or teachers at primary and secondary level is unjustifiable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">I ask that this matter be addressed speedily to allay the fears of many parents regarding the risks to which their children may be exposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2040">It is clear, on considering the provision of refuges around the country, that there is not sufficient capacity and that the problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the housing situation is chronic.  Thousands upon thousands of people are now waiting for social housing and people who may be at risk of violence are afraid to leave the family home because they know there is nowhere for them and that the world is very cold in terms of providing for them.  This adds to the fear and lack of safety people feel.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">Deputy Joan Burton, who chairs a steering committee to establish a refuge in Dublin 14, asked me to point out that it is an area with a population of almost 100,000 people that does not have a refuge.  Apparently some progress has been made in this regard but it is important that the practical facility is provided to ensure that places are there when people need to run.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">I pay tribute to the Labour Women's Council for producing a major document, in terms of analysing the problems and outlining the solutions concerning domestic violence and the provisions that need to be made.  The document makes an interesting point in highlighting the changing profile of women at risk.  Immigrant women are particularly at risk in the sex industry — a nice term to describe the exploitation of women.  Large numbers of immigrant women are involved in prostitution in Ireland and men are making a great deal of money from the business.  Women are vulnerable around the world, for example in India where millions of women have gone missing.  Baby girls there may not survive due to neglect or they may be killed.  Female babies are at a great disadvantage because they happen to be female.  I pay tribute to Trócaire for raising the fact that gender inequality globally is often a matter of life and death.</p>
            <p eId="para_2043">It is important to point out that it is not only women who are victims of domestic violence; men also experience domestic violence.  In some ways men are particularly vulnerable because they may be shut off from their children if they leave the home and this may not apply to mothers.  ACCORD, the marriage support organisation, analysed this issue and found that, while women were subjected to more extreme forms of physical and psychological abuse, men too can be victims of domestic violence.  ACCORD pointed out that frequently domestic violence is a mutual matter in a marriage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2044">We must reduce the level of violence regardless of whether the victim is a woman, a child or a man and we need to see practical measures to ensure that when domestic violence is experienced there are places for victims to run to.</p>

            <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_2046">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to speak on this important motion on domestic violence and I commend the Sinn Féin Members in the Dáil on bringing forward this excellent private Members' motion.  I also wish Deputy Ó Caoláin well as he is recovering from a serious illness.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">Domestic violence, assaults on women, assaults on children and families in crisis are huge issues.  The situation is serious and seems to be getting worse with alcohol abuse and the use of drugs compounding the problem of domestic violence.  The level of violence is high and we must address the issue of assaults on mothers and children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">In 2004 there were 4,079 reported cases of children at risk.  Of these, 267 cases of physical abuse were confirmed, 213 cases of child sexual abuse were confirmed, 339 cases of emotional abuse were confirmed and 596 cases of neglect were confirmed.  This means a total of 1,415 children were confirmed as abused in 2004 and that is a very high number.  At the moment we expect children from violent, dysfunctional families to behave normally and attend school every day.  Young children who witness violence may grow up to carry out violence on their own families and partners.  I urge the Government to wake up to this reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_2049">As the private Members' motion indicates an estimated one in five Irish women experience domestic violence at some point in their lives.  Of 106 women killed since 1996, 81 were killed in their homes and just less than 50% of victims whose cases have concluded were killed by a partner or ex-partner.  More than a third of all calls to the Women's Aid national phone helpline in 2005 went unanswered due to inadequate funding.  That is also a serious matter and I urge the Government to address it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2050">This motion gives us an opportunity to thank the foster parents of Ireland who are doing magnificent work with children at risk and children from dysfunctional families.  They have saved many children from jail, drug abuse and alcohol abuse in later life.  Foster parents provide stable families and warm homes and this work is very important.</p>
            <p eId="para_2051">I urge all Deputies in the House to support this motion and urge the Government to address its contents and implement its sensible ideas.</p>

            <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_2052">The rate of domestic violence is clear in these alarming statistics: one in every five women and one in every 15 men, experience domestic violence.  Yet the offices of State remain mostly ineffective in combatting the issue.  The fear factor and shame factor felt by victims of domestic violence, the lack of awareness regarding help available, the under funding of aid agencies, the lack of specialist training for gardaí and the need for continued training and information seminars for members of the Judiciary are all symptoms of this national disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_2053">In County Clare, which has a population of more than 110,000, the District Court has one specific day per month to deal with family law cases which include hearings for protection orders, safety orders and barring orders.  We are fortunate that, through the goodwill of the District Court judge, cases are heard before normal court business on other court days.  The need to allocate extra days for the full hearing of family law cases is urgent, as is the need to appoint specific judges to hear such cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2054">Equally important is the proper funding of agencies for the victims of domestic violence and an increase in the number of refuge homes available.  In 2006 Clare Haven House gave refuge to 118 women and 96 children.  It had 399 drop-in support visits and 150 visits to outreach clinics in Shannon, Kilrush, Scariff and Ennis.  Clare Haven House received 725 telephone calls seeking help yet the centre is hugely reliant on the goodwill of part-time staff to work nights and weekends.  While the funding received from the Health Service Executive and Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is welcome, it must be increased to provide ongoing training of staff and to improve facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2055">When victims of domestic violence work up sufficient courage to seek help from the Garda Síochána they need proper information and support.  Too often, they are simply referred to District Court offices.  Specialist training of gardaí is necessary so that victims receive all the help they require.  Too many gardaí are not aware of the difference between protection, safety and barring orders and the criteria required to secure them.  While applications for protection orders, which act as an interim order pending the hearing of an application for a further order, have a high rate of success, barring and safety orders are much more difficult to acquire.  Between 2000 and 2005, 88% of protection order applications were granted, whereas only 44% of barring order and 41% of safety order applications were successful.  Often the refusal was based on the applicant not meeting the criteria required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">To bar a person from his or her own home is an extremely serious matter but to refuse an application when a couple is not married or has not lived together for a sufficient period, rather than hearing the reasons the order has been sought in the first instance, is shameful.  The law needs to be changed immediately to reflect trends in modern society.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
            <p eId="para_2057">I support this important motion on domestic violence and sexual violence generally.  The motion is most comprehensive and deserves the support of all Members of the House.  It is a sad fact and a blot on society that violence against women in the home is a widespread and serious crime which is not given the priority or attention it requires.  Crimes of sexual violence, despite their rising incidence and increasingly horrific nature, do not receive the focus they deserve, either in the media or elsewhere.  So-called gangland gun crime seems to obsess everyone while the most appalling sexual crimes are not given the necessary emphasis.  If they were to become a focus of attention, perhaps a more proactive approach would be taken towards introducing many of the measures and steps outlined in the motion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">On the issue of sexual violence against women, in a Garda district in my constituency the recorded crime of rape increased by 50% during 2006.  This rise, which was much higher than the national average, barely received a mention in the national media, whereas gun and drug crimes receive constant blanket coverage and an unending litany of measures are introduced in response to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2059">I note the motion highlights the variation in Garda practice, even within Garda stations.  This is a serious issue which often dissuades women from making complaints.  I remember being present in a Garda station in the early hours of the morning when a distraught and battered woman entered seeking Garda assistance.  The response of the garda, in my presence, was to ask the woman if her husband had taken a few drinks and if she would not wait for an hour or two before returning home as her husband might then be sleeping off the drink.  Although it was patently obvious that she was terrified and had been brutally attacked, this seemed to be swept aside because the assailant was her husband and had taken a few drinks.  It was only when I intervened that the attitude of the garda in charge in the station changed.  This incident took place some years ago and I expect an entirely different approach would be taken these days.  I often wonder how many women continue to suffer silently because they have had a similar experience in the past and still believe they will not receive the necessary level of support from the authorities.  I support the motion.</p>

            <from>Mr. Healy</from>
            <p eId="para_2060">I support the motion and compliment Sinn Féin Deputies on tabling it.  I have a particular interest in the area of domestic violence, having been associated with a service for victims of domestic violence since the early 1990s.  While mayor of Clonmel, I became a patron of Cuan Saor, the main organisation providing services for victims of domestic violence in south Tipperary.  I have been associated with it ever since and I am currently a director of its board.  I compliment and thank everyone working in Cuan Saor, including its chairperson, Kaye Hyland, and her board, and the manager of services, Geraldine Mullane, and her staff who do an excellent job in difficult circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2061">Cuan Saor provides a full range of services, including a helpline, counselling, outreach services, court accompaniment and advice and guidance.  We also provide a refuge which was established in 1998-99.  Domestic violence services require serious levels of funding and resources.  In the past four to six weeks, Cuan Saor has been carrying out an assessment of the services we have provided over the years and is drawing up plans for the service we will provide over the next three years.  At every hand's turn in this process the absence of sufficient funding, resources and staff to provide an adequate service to people in south Tipperary who have been affected by the crime of domestic violence has emerged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2062">One of the points made in the motion tells us all we need to know, namely, that in 2005 more than one third of all calls to the Women's Aid national telephone helpline went unanswered due to inadequate funding.  I plead with the Minister to provide proper funding for domestic violence services, for which funding has effectively been capped since 2002.  We need to modernise services and properly fund and resource them.</p>

            <p eId="para_2063">I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, on his appointment.  This is the first time I have seen him in the Chamber since he took office.</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">This is a welcome debate of the utmost importance and I thank Sinn Féin for tabling the motion.  It is important because victims of domestic violence, by and large, feel unable to highlight the issue.  The home is where people expect a degree of security and believe they are among friends.  It is, therefore, chilling to realise that the violence under discussion occurs in the home.  It is startling that statistics suggest that one in five women in Ireland experience domestic violence.  Lest the debate be focused on one gender, it is important to recognise that men and children also experience domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">As noted in the motion, gardaí recorded an average of 23 incidents of domestic violence daily in 2003 compared with an average of 11 other assaults recorded daily.  This statistic indicates the extent of the problem.  Given the magnitude of domestic violence and the sensitivity with which it is bound up, it is vital that resources, structures and supports are provided to adequately address it.  Regrettably, this is not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">It is disgraceful that one third of all calls to the Women's Aid national telephone helpline went unanswered due to inadequate funding, especially when one considers that in many cases the advice given over the telephone by properly trained personnel can be invaluable.  Many of those who experience domestic violence suffer in silence, often due to the perceived shame that attaches to this form of violence.  Many people may be unable or unwilling to walk into a refuge as a first step and, therefore, require a process of steps.   Making a telephone call can be that vital first step on the road to dealing with the problem.  Some victims may not be physically able to make the journey to a centre.  For these reasons and more, it is vital that a properly resourced, fully efficient helpline is provided.  Such a helpline can be a lifeline.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">Having overcome that first step, there must be a comprehensive support system in place for victims.  However, there is also a shortage of refuges, which are vital if victims are to escape from the home and, consequently, the violence they have experienced. The statistics require no further analysis.  What is needed now is positive action.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_422">
            <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
            <p eId="para_2068">Domestic violence continues to be one of the most insidious and complicated forms of violence in contemporary Ireland.  It is estimated that up to one in five women has experienced domestic violence in some form on the part of a current or former partner or husband.  Domestic violence is by no means the preserve of one social or economic grouping in society.  Rather, it affects women from all walks of life.  Research shows that the criminal and civil justice systems consistently fail to recognise the complexities of domestic violence, address the safety of victims or hold offenders accountable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, announced yesterday that a national agency to combat domestic violence is in the offing.  This national agency will purportedly incorporate all the offices and agencies involved with domestic violence, thus ensuring a well co-ordinated Government response to the problem.  Layers of bureaucracy have been established in the past ten years to deal with this issue, including the establishment of the taskforce on violence against women and the national steering committee on violence against women.  Why not put funding into the desperately needed front-line services such as refuges rather than create another layer of bureaucracy?</p>
            <p eId="para_2070">This announcement smacks of electioneering.  Why does it come only two or three months before a general election?  The Government had a decade to make this a priority issue but it failed to do so.  The announcement flies in the face of the attitude of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform one month ago when he refused to secure the funding of the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency, NDVIA.  The agency's future hung in the balance for weeks as a result of sheer Government disinterest.  It was only when the NDVIA was on the verge of closing its doors and thus generating bad headlines that the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, took any action.  The Government's failure to intervene until the 11th hour was a clear indication of the total lack of commitment to providing care and assistance to those affected by domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">Statistics show that calls made to the Women's Aid helpline increased by 30% between 2004 and 2005 and that more than 10,000 calls were not answered.  That is a horrifying statistic.  A severe shortage of safe accommodation for vulnerable women and their children is a major problem.  The refuges in Bray and Rathmines, for example, must cope with all the cases for south Dublin.  There is nowhere in Dún Laoghaire for women to go.  It is an appalling statistic that more than 500 women and 1,000 children sought refuge from domestic violence last year in the Dublin area alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">The Green Party strongly supports the work of the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency pilot project based in Dún Laoghaire.  The agency works in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, Courts Service, probation and welfare service, Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We must have a strong inter-agency response to domestic violence that places the safety of victims and their children as paramount.  This scheme should be in receipt of multi-annual funding and should be rolled out throughout the State on a phased basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">It is important to recognise that men also suffer domestic violence at the hands of women.  The statistics are available in this regard.  However, the bulk of the violence that takes place in a domestic setting is against women.  It typifies the male dominance in Cabinet that multi-annual funding has not been provided for domestic violence as it is for major infrastructural projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">The statistics speak for themselves.  In the past ten years, more than 100 women were murdered in Ireland, the vast bulk of them in their own homes.  In those cases that have been resolved, all were perpetrated by a man and almost half by the victim's partner or ex-partner.  There is no time to waste.  This is an issue that must be dealt with without delay.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_423">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2075">I thank all Deputies for their contribution to this debate on violence against women.  Everyone who spoke made it clear that domestic violence is a horrible crime.  The Government fully recognises the vileness of this crime, which can damage victims both physically and emotionally and leave them living in fear.  Society is also damaged by this crime because its victims are robbed of their ability to participate fully in their community and to achieve their full potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">The harm carries down the generations.  Research published last year by the children's research centre in Trinity College, Dublin, working with Mayo Women's Support Services, gives a stark picture of children living in violent homes and the damage done to them and to their relationships unless help is sought and given.  Several Members observed that children are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">The Government recognises the harm done and provides protection under the Domestic Violence Acts 1996 and 2002, Child Care Act 1991 and a significant code of Criminal Justice Acts.  The courts have full powers under the Child Care Act to make such directions as they see fit as to the care and the custody of the child.  The courts may also make a supervision order under the 1991 Act in respect of the parent of the child, pending any investigation.  This power of the courts exists under the 1991 Act, regardless of whether proceedings are taken under the Domestic Violence Acts.  In proceedings under the Domestic Violence Acts, the court has power of its motion or on the basis of an application to make orders under the Child Care Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">The Government recognises the seriousness of the problem of domestic violence and has, therefore, substantially increased funding provided to the sector.  In the past ten years, funding to front-line services provided through the HSE has more than tripled.  I noted the concern expressed about the Women's Aid helpline, which provides an invaluable service to women experiencing violence.  While 2007 funding for Women's Aid is still under discussion in the HSE, its interim funding was increased by an additional €69,000 to ensure the helpline can be fully staffed immediately.  Funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to local authorities for accommodation specifically for victims of domestic violence, including refuges and transitional accommodation, has doubled since 2002 to €2.2 million in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">There has been a sevenfold increase in the past five years for the awareness-raising and perpetrator programmes of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to exceed €2.1 million in 2007.  Crucially, the Government made a commitment to continued funding to tackle domestic violence in the national development plan for the period 2007 to 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">Law courts throughout the State allow people to have their cases heard in their own locality.  Separate family law suites, which include smaller and more informal courtrooms, separate waiting areas and private consultation rooms, are provided or will be provided in courthouses in all major towns to enable family law business to be transacted with the sensitivity it requires, in private and in confidence.  There are occasional difficulties in providing these additional facilities in some courthouses due to the constraints imposed because a particular courthouse forms part of the architectural heritage of the State and is listed for preservation as such.  As part of the courts building programme, victim and witness rooms are provided either on a dedicated basis or on a day-of-use basis depending on the space available.  The room provided is away from the main public areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">As outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, last night, a comprehensive range of criminal justice sanctions is in place to tackle domestic violence.  Contravention of any order under the Domestic Violence Acts is an offence and subject to sanctions of a fine or imprisonment or both.  The Garda has necessary powers of arrest without warrant to deal with cases of domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">The role of the Garda in responding to domestic violence was raised by several Deputies.  Members of the Garda Síochána are trained to the highest standard in dealing with incidents of domestic violence.  All gardaí receive initial training on the investigation of cases of domestic violence.  Core programmes on violence at the Garda in-service training schools cover causes and effects of crimes of violence on women and children, domestic violence, forensic evidence in crimes of violence against women and children, interviewing victims of crimes of violence against women and children and all relevant legislation.  This training is provided by experienced Garda personnel, assisted by other professionals, such as psychologists, doctors, social workers and experts from the various non-governmental organisations.  Garda training addresses issues particular to the investigation of cases of domestic violence, assisted by appropriate professionals and recognised experts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">The Garda has a written policy on domestic violence intervention to direct it.  The decision to arrest is not down simply to the stated wishes of the injured person upon arrival at the scene.  The policy recognises that the victim is in vulnerable circumstances.  Any evidence of fear or harassment is brought to the attention of the court in the event of a bail application.  The Garda role is, in a sense, to put officers between the power and dominance of the offender and to seek to break that hold over the victim.  This domestic violence policy is an integral part of Garda training and is reinforced continuously.  Feedback shows that it is very well regarded nationally and internationally and has made for an improved response.  Notwithstanding this improvement, the Garda has been involved in a major review of its features, with a view to modernising and improving them further.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">The Garda Síochána domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit has a national role and it collates all incidents of domestic violence in the State.  The Garda is also represented at inspector level on each of the regional planning committees on violence against women.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">The Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, gave funding last year of €304,000 for court accompaniment services to groups providing support to women experiencing domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">Experience over the past ten years has shown that certain groups in society are not always well-served by the mainstream responses.  There is a growing recognition that these groups may have requirements that are not taken into account by existing services.  To meet the needs of women who are particularly vulnerable because of their ethnic minority status, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has provided funding to the Immigrant Council of Ireland to develop a forum on domestic violence for migrant women and to the Women's Health Council to research migrant women's experience of domestic violence and provide principles of good practice to service providers.  Funding has also been provided to Women's Aid and groups providing local and regional services to produce leaflets and posters in minority languages to raise awareness of the issue of domestic violence and the services available to women from migrant communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">Several Deputies have referred to the situation of the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency.  I make it clear that following the receipt of the final report of the completed pilot project at the end of January 2007, further funding for the project on an interim basis was agreed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the NDVIA.  The aim of this local pilot project was to develop an integrated response to domestic violence.  Analysis of the findings of the project is taking place in the context of a major policy review in the Department to see how such an approach may be progressed on a nationwide basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2088">In light of the complexity of the issue and the number of different agencies involved, the Government established the national steering committee on violence against women in 1997 to facilitate a multidisciplinary and co-ordinated response from the State and the voluntary sector.  Under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, the committee comprises those Departments and agencies charged with responding to the issue as well as representatives from a wide range of non-governmental organisations working with women who have suffered violence.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has commissioned a new strategic action plan for the NSC to take account of developments since it was established and the progress that has been made.  The NSC is now considering the final draft of the plan together with the recommendations of its own advisory group on the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">As a result of this work and consultation, we can look forward to proposals being brought to Government shortly on the establishment of a dedicated office that will ensure the development of a well co-ordinated integrated response from all the  Departments and State agencies to violence against women.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">Deputy McManus suggested that the vetting unit now based in Thurles is not working in the context of rolling out the vetting plan for those with unsupervised access to children.  The decentralisation to Thurles has been a great success to date, with a huge demand to work there, and the phased roll out of vetting to all sectors with unsupervised access to children is now well under way.  Historically, the health sector was always covered by the operation of the vetting unit.  It was extended to cover education in the autumn of 2006 and is currently being extended to other sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">The Government will continue to promote a comprehensive strategic approach to the matter of violence against women and our counter-motion is indicative of that approach.  The Government supports strong civil and criminal law measures, dedicated administrative measures, a whole of Government approach and is providing substantial extra funding on all fronts in 2007.</p>

            <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_2092">Last night it was pointed out that there will be 35 assaults before a victim makes a report to the Garda.  The victims often say they feel trapped, helpless, ignored, abandoned or at a loss.  They feel they have nowhere to go and are ashamed.  They say, "He does not mean it, he really loves me and the kids.  I probably provoke him".  There are others who say nothing while the abuse continues.  I have an image in my head of a woman who came to me, telling me of her partner putting a pillow over their child's face and saying that if she reported him for abuse, he would kill her and the children.  She contacted me to seek support from the Garda but the Garda said it did not have the resources.  She was told to lock her door and contact the Garda if there was a problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">Our motion calls on the Government to prioritise and guarantee core funding to front line services for domestic violence on a multi-annual basis to allow for the strategic development and delivery of services.  If we can deliver that then victims may no longer feel trapped, helpless, ignored or abandoned, they may feel like they have somewhere to go or someone to talk to.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">The Tallaght based domestic violence refuge, Saoirse, took 13 years to develop from an idea to a front line group working with victims of domestic violence.  When it was established, it was agreed that the HSE would pay staff salaries and the local authority, South Dublin County Council, would pay day to day costs, including heating and lighting on a quarterly basis and in advance.  The  first payments were made from January to November 2006 and nothing has been paid since.  This refuge is currently helping six families and it should not have to wait for day to day funding.  It should also not have to wait months for the HSE to supply the house with a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">The majority of funding for domestic violence services comes from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Department of Health and Children.  These groups are supposed to work on the front line to help victims but end up spending their time chasing down different Departments looking for mixed funding.  The Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, last night announced his intention to establish a domestic violence office.  This is a welcome development but if this office is to be a success it must be given the statutory responsibility to handle funding allocations from all Departments on a multi-annual basis with the full budget allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">Funding to front line services has been capped since 2002 — my party regularly calls for that cap to be lifted.  What possible basis was there for capping funding to the domestic violence sector during an era of successive budget surpluses?  Was there evidence that domestic violence was no longer an issue?  Clearly not.  Was there evidence that services were meeting the demand?  No.  It was an unjustifiable decision on the part of this Government and while I welcome the €4.5 million for 2007, more money is needed.  Budgets must be guaranteed to develop front line services in future.</p>

            <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_2097">The Government's case for its amendment was particularly weak.  The amendment and the speeches from the Government side of the House do nothing more than note, welcome and commend measures that clearly fall far short of what is needed.  The Government offers no concrete commitments, other than the possible prospect of an office within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I welcome, however, the Minister of State's announcement last night of his intention to establish a new office to deal with domestic violence.  I hope this is not merely another election promise that will not be delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">Why must the Government wait for a Sinn Féin motion on domestic violence before announcing the possibility of a new co-ordinating mechanism?  I question what meaningful effect it could have, in the absence of the other reforms and resources called for by us.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">I welcome the support of the rest of the Opposition for our motion.  It seems the Government parties are refusing to stand with all other parties in this House to tackle the grave issue of domestic violence which is an ongoing nightmare for so many on this island.  I would like to respond comprehensively to many deficiencies in the Government's explanation and its stubborn refusal to support Sinn Féin's motion.  However, given the time available to me I will address just a few.  In his contribution this evening the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told us "The Garda has necessary powers of arrest without warrant to deal with cases of domestic violence".  That is really newsworthy — what a revelation.  His contribution was a rehash of what the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, told us last night when he outlined the provisions of the Domestic Violence Acts without acknowledging any of the agreed shortcomings of these Acts.  The Government is in denial.  In refusing to support our call to address the limits imposed by residency requirements in those Acts he cited "legal difficulties" as his excuse.  This recommendation has not come from us or from Women's Aid alone.  It is a recommendation that was made by the Law Reform Commission which comprises some of the country's leading legal experts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">He stated the Department and its agencies make the protection of barring orders available to women who experience violence, but he made no effort to mention or explain the huge variance in the granting of these protection orders, from 28% in the Dublin region to 70% in the northern region.  The Government is in denial.  He cited the existence of the Garda Síochána's domestic violence policy — as did we in our motion — and the various lectures they receive on the issue.  However, he failed to explain or even acknowledge the variation in Garda practice that exists in reality.  I agree with the Minister of State that the reasons for not reporting are complex.  However, the reasons he cited centre exclusively on the subjective view of victims of their own situation.  He does not acknowledge that poor Garda practice and judicial response also influence rates of reporting.  The Government is in denial of its responsibilities.  The Minister of State should live up to his responsibility and acknowledge it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">People often ask why the victims of domestic violence do not just leave — as if it were that simple.  A great number of factors contribute to women staying in abusive relationships, some of which have been identified by our motion.  Not least of these is the international finding that a woman is 70% more likely to be raped, severely assaulted or murdered after she accesses the legal system and attempts to leave her abuser.  It is essential that all factors, once identified, be rectified.  Earlier this evening I heard a Government backbencher refer to this statistic.  However, unfortunately it did not move him enough to commit to vote constructively on the issue as, I am sure we will find in ten minutes' time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">Research shows that domestic violence is a cross-class, issue.  It does not occur more in one socio-economic group than it does in another.  However, disadvantaged groups and women in poverty face increased barriers because they may have fewer options in terms of having a place to which they can escape after they leave the abusive relationship.  Very often leaving an abuser can result in severe poverty and disadvantage.  Likewise economic bullying and control of finances can go hand-in-hand with domestic violence and victims who may appear affluent may still face serious financial barriers to leaving.  We all know of such cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">One of the greatest barriers to victims — by which I mean women and men — of domestic violence preventing them from freeing themselves from their current situation is the shortage of accommodation places.  We are in a housing crisis and have been for years.  However, even with the national obsession of debating that crisis, discussing house prices and giving air time to economists offering their take on whether interest rates will rise, the specific accommodation and housing needs of vulnerable groups, and particularly victims of domestic violence, do not feature.  The needs of these victims, just like the crimes against them, are banished to secrecy, behind closed doors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2104">In a recent submission to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, a representative of Women's Aid highlighted the shortage of refuge accommodation, saying "Whether there are services available depends on the part of the country in which one lives".  Is that not a sad reality?  Calling for an increase in the amount of transitional and emergency spaces, a representative of One Stop Shop, Cork elaborated further, saying there is a decided lack of second-stage housing and refuge spaces, making private rented accommodation the only available option.  That group also noted the unsuitability of this situation, given that rent allowance ceilings have not kept pace with inflation, thus making "homelessness a stark possibility".  Local authorities have responsibility for provision of housing for households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources, with only negligible support from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  People have a right to housing and that includes victims of domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2105">A statistic given earlier in more than one contribution is worth repeating because of the sheer scale of the problem.  It is estimated that one in every five women will experience domestic violence at one time or another.  There are 18 women's refuges in the State across 16 counties.  Their total capacity is 454 beds, which will cater for just 111 women and 353 children at any one time.  There is a drastic shortage of refuge accommodation for women who have been forced to leave the home due to domestic violence.  In 2001, some 1,104 women were refused accommodation in the three women's refuges in the eastern region alone.  Very often those refused are forced to stay in emergency accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2106">Studies carried out on behalf of the Homeless Agency have concluded that the use of bed and breakfasts and the increasing length of time that victims live in them is unacceptable.  Living in a bed and breakfast means living in overcrowded and grossly inadequate accommodation.  I am sure the Minister of State, like the rest of us in the House, has dealt with such cases.  I recently dealt with the case of a mother with three children living in a bed and breakfast.  She needed to leave it every morning at 9 a.m. and walk the streets of a major town in my constituency.  She could not return to that accommodation until 5 p.m.  In the depths of winter that woman and her three children were on the streets exposed to all the elements.  She had little or no comfort.  The Government and its predecessor have left people in such situations for ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2107">Sonas Housing Agency has highlighted the serious shortage of refuge space for women and children where they could access safety, and avail of the expert support and advocacy provided by front-line specialist services on violence against women.  Being forced to live in unsafe and unsuitable accommodation results in an increased risk of threats and intimidation from ex-partners and husbands.  Returning to the primary home often results in further risk and threats.  Homeless hostels and bed and breakfasts are not equipped to respond to the risk and trauma that women and children have experienced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2108">Sinn Féin believes it is imperative for the Government to provide supported social housing to women and men subjected to domestic violence who have left crisis accommodation and have ongoing support needs, as well as a need for safe, secure accommodation.  If victims are to survive — it is that serious — the Government must take steps to meet the emergency, transitional and long-term housing needs of victims and their families.  Failure to do so is unjustifiable and unacceptable.  Victims of domestic violence really need our support to ensure provision of essential services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2109">I acknowledge the welcome for the Sinn Féin motion that was demonstrated not only by the Opposition, but also by a number of Government backbenchers.  We will see in a few moments what way those positive-speaking backbench Government Deputies will vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">I thank all those who contributed to the debate and especially those who made constructive points and supported the Sinn Féin motion.  I urge all those on the Government backbenches who spoke favourably on our motion to show conviction by having the courage to support the motion.  In the case of hospital services in Roscommon we recently saw the influence Government backbenchers can have when they stamp their feet and wag their fingers.  I hope the Government backbench Deputies will show the same backbone and courage for the people referred to in our motion and will stand by these people who need our support.  They need Government action but have been ignored for a long time.  I hope the Minister's amendment will be defeated and that the motion will be carried.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_2337">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which I generally support.  There is widespread agreement in the House on the need to have strong structures in place to protect consumers from unscrupulous practices and to provide a framework for the protection of consumer rights so as to obviate the need for consumers to go the legal route, which is an expensive, stressful and in many ways unsatisfactory means of resolving some of the consumer issues people experience on a day-to-day basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2338">The Bill has room for improvement and we will attempt to introduce this on later Stages of the Bill.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's thoughts on the issue of Internet retailing at a later stage.  This is the fastest growth area in retailing.  What would be the powers of the agency <i>vis-à-vis</i> businesses that operate in this area, given its international nature?  It is a difficult area to police in terms of seeking legal redress, given the limited mechanisms that can be introduced by a national agency to deal with an entity trading on the Internet.  This is an area we need to amend and improve to ensure legislation is up to speed with the extent of change that is rapidly occurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_2339">Deputy Boyle has spoken generally on the Bill so I will address specific points.  One of the concerns I have is with the extent of overlap that may exist between different State agencies involved in the broad remit of consumer protection.  As my party's spokesperson on communications, marine and natural resources, it is interesting that we are currently debating a Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill which gives significant powers to ComReg — the communications regulator — similar to those enjoyed by the Competition Authority.  In a sense, they are similar to the powers set out in the Bill, given that they aim, on behalf of the consumer, to ensure there is not unfair pricing, unfair billing nor improper use of market dominance to the consumer's disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_2340">I accept the Bill sets out a provision enabling the Minister to direct the agency to work with other State bodies.  However, in the area of telecommunications, which is one of large consumer expenditure, there is much concern about difficulties over the purchase of ringtones, for example.  Internet shopping is related to the role of ComReg in communications.  There is an overlap between the Competition Authority, the new powers given to ComReg and the powers outlined in this Bill.  It is unclear which takes precedence or how each is intended to work with the other.  Perhaps this could be set out more clearly to ensure the most effective use of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_2341">I expect Deputy Boyle referred to the means by which we are setting up such new bodies, in terms of ministerial appointment on the basis of expertise criteria that are difficult to assess.  There is genuine concern on this side of the House on this matter.  In the past five years in which I have been a Member of the House, much of the legislation that has been introduced involved a Minister setting up various boards, which are expensive structures.  It is also remarkable the number of people over which the Minister has the power of appointment, often on a voluntary or part-time basis.  The Minister may say it is easy for me to say this on the Opposition benches but it is a genuine concern based on a desire to see the most effective agencies rather than a political point scoring exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_2342">Perhaps we would be better off appointing agencies or boards on a similar basis to that on which we employ senior civil servants or members of local authorities.  Perhaps a separate commission is required which would assess candidates and ensure there is a balance of expertise and skills.  This is not to criticise the Minister in question.  However, the continued use of ministerial appointments is open to criticism of political patronage and is not necessarily in the long-term interests of any agency being established.</p>
          <p eId="para_2343">I am conscious of time and the fact other speakers are sharing my time.  In general, I am in favour of the Bill.  My party will not hinder its progress through the Dáil.  I hope the legislation will be passed and the agency which is already up and functioning will use the powers which have been assigned to it to good effect on behalf of consumers.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_429">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_2344">Sinn Féin welcomes the Consumer Protection Bill, especially the sections which establish the National Consumer Agency, NCA, and those which transpose the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive into the law of this State.  This will have the effect of prohibiting unfair commercial practices, in particular misleading and aggressive commercial practices.  In addition, we welcome the important measure to ban pyramid schemes that inevitably turn out to be fake and the rip-off scratch cards where one must pay some kind of fee before one can claim a prize which one has already won.</p>
          <p eId="para_2345">We welcome the fact that the National Consumer Agency will be a statutory body, independent in the performance of its functions and that it will also have responsibilities in the areas of consumer advocacy, research, educational awareness, information and enforcement and will finally combine with what the former Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It is important for the NCA to become a strong advocate for the consumer when it comes to consumer welfare issues.  However, given that the NCA was established on an interim basis almost two years ago, it is most disappointing the Bill is only now being discussed in the House.  The delay in their merger is unacceptable and shows how low consumer protection is on the Government agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_2346">Despite welcoming the introduction of legislation that is intended to safeguard the rights of consumers, it is ironic that this Bill is being discussed in the Dáil only a matter of months after the groceries order was repealed by the Government.  As well as its primary aim of promoting consumer advocacy, the Bill also aims to promote competition.  The repeal of the groceries order was intended to promote competition.  Instead, the repeal of the ban on below-cost selling has been proven to eliminate or reduce competition, not increase it.  This Government initiative was sold to the public on the basis that retailers would pass on their savings on to the consumer.  Clearly, this has not happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_2353">The new situation has enabled supermarkets to lower prices on certain high profile items, to be used as loss leaders to attract customers, while other goods are priced the same, or even higher than independent retailers.  Is this the type of unfair commercial practice that will be covered by the Bill?  Will the National Consumer Agency advocate for a reduction in costs in supermarkets?  If it does, will it be a real vehicle for championing consumers' rights or will it be a cosmetic exercise at best, to attract people into shops, where it is not the supermarkets that pay for it, but the farm producers who receive a constantly reducing proportion of the final cost of items?</p>
          <p eId="para_2354">Buying a house is a consumer action.  Will the National Consumer Agency be advocating on behalf of those who are faced with rates of house price inflation that are out of control?  This inflation has all but priced working families and first-time buyers out of the private housing market, with average costs of €308,000 to €516,000 in the State.  The average price of a new home was 11% higher in 2006 compared to the previous year.  Figures for the same period show an increase of more than 17% in second-hand house prices in the Dublin area.  House prices are increasing at almost twice the rate of wage increases.  It is no wonder that public sector workers such as nurses, fire fighters and teachers cannot afford to buy a home in our major cities.  My Sinn Féin colleagues hope that it is within the remit of the NCA's advocacy role to tackle the Government and get it to address the rising cost of purchasing a home.</p>
          <p eId="para_2355">The practices of some estate agents may also play a role in inflating house prices.  They have an inbuilt incentive for inflation because they receive a percentage of the price of the sale.  There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that some estate agents use underhand measures to increase the cost of housing for their own profit.  This combination of incentive and opportunity requires a robust policy response.</p>
          <p eId="para_2356">Section 53(1)(<i>a</i>) deals with prohibited commercial practices:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2357">A trader shall not engage in any of the following commercial practices:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2358">(<i>a</i>) a representation that the trader has an approval, authorisation or endorsement that the trader does not have, or making such a representation when the trader is not in compliance with that approval, authorisation or endorsement;</p>
          <p eId="para_2359">That sounds very good but how will it work in practice?  It is well known that estate agents tell a bidder that there are other parties interested in a property and that the other bids are higher.  I hope that this section of the Bill will prevent potential buyers from being exploited in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_2360">Management fees charged in new housing units is another area in which consumers are in need of protection.  It is necessary to have management companies in blocks of apartments.  The main problem with private management companies is that they impose a form of double taxation through management fees.  It is fundamentally inequitable that some residents must pay for a service that their neighbours receive for free and we hope that the NCA will deal with this issue in a thorough manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_2361">Although they are subject to company law, such private estate management companies are unregulated.  Many specific problems are associated with their proliferation in this State, in particular the total lack of accountability to the residents who pay for the services and the fact that the fees charged are often exorbitant and subject to huge increases.  In some cases they rise by 300% in a single year without a corresponding improvement in service.  The Bill partially defines one facet of unfair commercial practice as something that would be "likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that the average consumer would not otherwise make".  The average consumer would not pay a 300% increased management fee unless they were forced into it and this is a perfect example of unfair commercial practice.  I hope this Bill will deal comprehensively with these issues.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_2362">I welcome the Bill as far as it goes but I fear consumers will feel removed from the National Consumer Agency.  If the consumer is not <i>au fait</i> with legislation, the Bill will not serve its purpose.  The functions of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, whatever they are, will be subsumed into the National Consumer Agency.  What difference will that make to the consumer?  Will the paraphernalia of the Director of Consumer Affairs be transferred to the National Consumer Agency so that we have the same service as before but with a new name?  How can the consumer be better served by this move?</p>
          <p eId="para_2363">Many consumers feel far removed from the establishment and this agency will be seen as part of that establishment.  Consumers will not bother dealing with the bureaucracy to vindicate their rights.  It will prove too cumbersome.  The Minister should simplify the system and bring the machinery closer to the people, making them feel part of the process and making the system more transparent and meaningful.  He should consult the people who perceive the establishment as their enemy and should not commission another report.  This would be prepared by some Dublin-based so-called professional who is part of the establishment.  Such a person would not know or care how the consumer feels.  The answer is not always to commission another report.</p>
          <p eId="para_2364">I have difficulty with the closeness that will develop between the Minister of the day and the National Consumer Agency.  The Bill allows leeway for the Minister to consult the agency and seek reports from it, etc.  Will the agency feel obliged to adapt its thinking to suit the Government?  The agency should be completely separate from the Government.  If it is to earn the respect and confidence of the consumer the new agency must be the champion of the consumer.  Links to government will not achieve that champion status.</p>
          <p eId="para_2365">The new agency will be concerned with prices.  Inflation is a major issue and some of the reasons for this are outside our control.  Stealth taxes impact on people and we need a responsible debate on the matter rather than the tabloid approach of Mr. Eddie Hobbs.  The National Consumer Agency can play an important role in an informed debate if it is seen as totally independent of government and a champion of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_2366">Unfortunately, this new agency will not cover local authorities.  The public are daily consumers of local authority services and need protection and support.  Local authorities leave much to be desired in the manner in which they deliver services.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is no help in this regard.  He only passes the buck rather than solving problems.  Those who are dissatisfied with the service of local authorities have no simple route of redress.  The service is not good enough.  In recent years we have created a monster in local authorities where the buck never stops at anyone's desk.  No one knows anything and everything is referred to someone who cannot be found, will not answer the phone and whose mailbox is full.  Calls are not returned because the person is at the launch of something or other.  Local authority staff never attend such events alone; they attend in numbers so nothing gets done.  The consumer must put up with this and neither the Bill nor the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will help this cause.  Someone must accept responsibility.  The Government must do so because the public expects action to be taken.  They are fed up with being fobbed off.</p>
          <p eId="para_2367">In recent years local authorities have developed customer charters that contain high and mighty aspirations but nothing real.  Worse, they fall back on the customer charter when challenged, even though it is nothing but paper and window dressing.  They go through the motions but do not deliver.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_2368">I welcome the Consumer Protection Bill, which is progressive and sensible.  Consumer protection is the message in this legislation.  We must face the reality that many consumers, citizens and taxpayers are not protected and their rights are not vindicated.  This is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_2369">The purpose of the Bill is to establish a body known as the National Consumer Agency and to define its functions:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2370">to give effect to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005), to make new provision in relation to pyramid selling schemes, to amend the Industrial Development Act 1993, and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_2371">When talking about consumer protection it is important to note that prices are going through the roof.  In recent weeks there have been major price increases in food, vegetables, fruit, gas and electricity.  This Government, and the Minister, must address this because matters are getting out of control, regardless of pay increases for workers and staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_2372">There has been a 15% rent increase for people living in Dublin City Council housing projects, particularly those living on the northside of Dublin.  I will defend the rights of the people living in my constituency of Dublin North-Central who have contacted my office because that increase is a little too much for them.  The price rises affect the elderly, the disabled and working people in general.  We must respect these people as consumers but more so as citizens because they must put up with the high prices which affect everybody's quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_2373">There is a crisis in Dublin such that young couples are unable to buy new homes which is unacceptable.  We need to develop new ideas to assist these couples, whether through affordable housing or other schemes.  A radical new approach is needed to help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2374">The Minister and the Cabinet have a responsibility not to waste public money.  The now famous Dublin Port tunnel was €200 million over budget.  This is a scandal, and coupled with the 294 homes in my constituency that have been damaged as a result, it is unacceptable.  The electronic voting scandal wasted €52 million.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who says he is concerned about the costs of the tribunals, spent €30 million on a farm that most people on the northside of Dublin would say was worth only €4 million.  The site of the Battle of the Boyne could have been bought for €2.7 million but was instead bought by a private business and sold to the Office of Public Works 18 months later for €7.8 million.  In the Minister's constituency the revamp of the courthouse in Cork was estimated at €6.5 million but cost the taxpayer €26.5 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_2380">The Minister for Transport had 30 road projects which should have cost €932 million but ended by costing €2 billion.  These projects were 86% over budget.  This is what consumers talk about.  They want value for their money.  This money could have been used to end the patients on trolleys scandal forever, to build new schools, make a major dent in the housing lists, develop child care services or assist the elderly.  These are crucial issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_2381">Section 8 of the Bill provides:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2382">that the Agency shall have certain functions.  The Section provides the Agency with a general function of promoting and protecting the interests and welfare of consumers and that it shall also be responsible for investigating, enforcing and encouraging compliance with consumer protection legislation including, where appropriate, referring cases involving possible indictable offences to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2383">The key phrase there is "the interests and welfare of consumers".  The Independent Deputies will look after consumers and give value for money after the next election, no matter what people say in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_2384">I welcome the positive aspects of the legislation.  Section 10 provides:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2385">for membership of the Agency, its numbers, how they are to be appointed, paid, replaced, removed etc. The Section provides that the Agency shall consist of a chairperson and 12 ordinary members and that the CEO shall be a member of the Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_2386">It is necessary to appoint a quality person as CEO of this agency, who will look after the interests and rights of consumers and operate the agency in a professional way.</p>
          <p eId="para_2387">Section 11 "provides that the Minister shall designate one member of the Agency as the chairperson and that the chairperson's term of office shall be 5 years".  I welcome that as a sensible solution.  A five year term is enough to deal with the situation.  If somebody proves him or herself this could be considered in broader terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_2388">Section 41 "prohibits traders from engaging in commercial practices that mislead consumers".  This is crucial because many people mislead consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2389">Section 43 prohibits:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2390">commercial practices which would be likely to cause the average consumer to confuse a trader's product, trade name, trade mark or other distinguishing feature or mark with that of a competitor and to make a transactional decision that he or she would not otherwise make.</p>
          <p eId="para_2391">I welcome the opportunity to defend the rights of consumers and taxpayers.  I have concerns about the financial implications of the Bill but I will waive those for the moment.  The Bill is in the interests of the consumer and I welcome it.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_2394">I also believe in promoting competition to keep prices down and strengthening competition laws to get the best deal for consumers.  Much has been done in this regard.  We have abolished the groceries order and amended the Competition Act to prohibit re-sale price maintenance, unfair discrimination and hello money in the grocery trade.  While it may be too early to make a judgment, according to figures compiled by the Central Statistics Office the prices of products previously covered by the groceries order have fallen by 0.5% in the year to mid-January 2007.  The prices of goods not covered increased by 5.1% over the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_2395">We have removed the barrier to competition but it does not follow that prices will fall.  The acid test of whether the abolition of the groceries order has been successful is whether grocery price inflation is lower than it would be according to other essential factors.  We have increased funding for consumer protection substantially.  The allocation for consumer issues in 2007 will amount to just under €8.4 million, an increase of 147% since 2004.  The Competition Authority budget has been increased by 15% to €5.8 million, doubling resources in its cartel enforcement division.</p>
          <p eId="para_2396">We are determined to ensure prices are open and clearly visible to consumers so they can make their choices.  In April 2003 the Government introduced new price display regulations to enable consumers see what they are buying and compare prices across goods.  Shops must now display the cost by weight.  We can compare the prices of biscuits, coffee or cereal per 100g irrespective of packaging.  The Government also doubled the number of inspectors in the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2397">Nevertheless, over the past decade, it has become apparent that by comparison with other highly developed countries, consumer power is weak in Ireland.  In many areas of commercial and public decision making, the consumer has no voice.  In many areas of daily life, consumers feel they have little power.  In that context the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was right to establish the Consumer Strategy Group and ask it to make proposals for the development of a national consumer strategy.  The Bill we are debating today is a result of the good work of that group.</p>
          <p eId="para_2398">The group commissioned the most extensive research ever carried out in Ireland on consumer issues.  It revealed that the majority of consumers believe they are constantly being overcharged for goods and services.  A large number believe they will not get satisfaction if they complain about poor quality or poor value in goods and services.  Research conducted by the Consumer Strategy Group showed considerable gaps in policy and in the State institutions that support consumers.  Ireland lags behind other countries in recognising the important role empowered and confident consumers can play.</p>
          <p eId="para_2399">Bringing the consumer agenda to the forefront of public policy requires close integration of consumer concerns into the better regulation agenda.  There is no doubt that a process needs to be kick-started to shift the balance of power towards consumers.  Doing so will not penalise Irish businesses or grind them down.  It should strengthen them.  In short, more consumer power will be good for consumers, businesses and the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2400">This is a major new consumer Bill.  It replaces much of the existing body of consumer law with a modern, up-to-date statute that will provide consumers with the highest level of protection in their dealings with business.  The new protection for consumers and overhaul of structures marks the biggest reform in 30 years.  It will help to ensure that we have one of the strongest, most modern consumer protection regimes in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_2401">The Bill includes bans and tough sanctions for 81 anti-consumer activities, including pyramid selling, prize draw scams and persistent cold-calling of consumers.  It also formally establishes the new National Consumer Agency, which will have the funding and powers to act forcefully on behalf of consumers.  It provides the agency with the power to protect consumers, and will prohibit a wide range of unfair or misleading trade practices.  Traders who mislead consumers or act in an aggressive way towards consumers or who otherwise engage in the extensive list of practices to be prohibited by the Bill will be liable to fines of up to €60,000 or imprisonment for up to 18 months for a first offence, if successfully prosecuted on indictment.  Lesser penalties will apply in respect of summary prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_2402">The agency will also be empowered to issue compliance notices and impose on-the-spot fines on errant traders.  It will be able to accept undertakings of compliance with the law from traders as an alternative to court proceedings.  It will be required to publish, on a regular basis, details of all traders who have faced enforcement action.  Courts will be empowered to order offenders to pay compensation to consumers and will be able to require offenders to publish corrective statements.  Undoubtedly, the adverse publicity of a name and shame policy can often be a more effective deterrent than a court imposed fine.  This Bill leaves offenders with no hiding place in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_2403">A wide range of activity is prohibited by the Bill, from misleading consumers as to the price, characteristics and availability of a product, to exercising aggressive or undue influence on a consumer to enter into a transaction.  Making false or misleading claims about a product, persistent, unwanted calling of consumers and operating prize competitions that require the consumer to make a payment or incur a loss before a prize can be claimed, are all outlawed by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_2404">The principal function of the National Consumer Agency will be to promote and protect the interests and welfare of consumers.  It will do that through enforcing the relevant provisions of the Bill and encouraging compliance with them.  However, it is also being given a range of powers to ensure that it can be a powerful advocate on behalf of consumers in policy making and in public debate.  The agency will be empowered to advise and make proposals and recommendations to Government on legislation that impacts on consumers, and will interact with other regulatory bodies to promote the interests and welfare of consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2405">The Bill also deals in no uncertain terms with the issue of pyramid schemes.  The definition of such schemes is significantly strengthened to capture so-called "gifting" schemes, and it will be an offence to both promote and participate in such schemes.  Offenders will face prosecution on indictment and be liable to fines of up to €150,000 and five years imprisonment.  I did not know what pyramid schemes were until, unfortunately, my local town and the surrounding area was affected by one.  Many local people suffered as a result of pyramid selling in the area.  It had a serious effect on individuals and families.  People thought that by investing hard earned money in the scheme they would make far more money.  Some people even borrowed money to invest in these schemes.  Unfortunately, they lost it all.</p>
          <p eId="para_2406">This Bill will safeguard people from such schemes.  However, it will not help the thousands of people in my constituency who suffered.  I thank the Minister for introducing this welcome Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_448">
          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_2407">I wish to share time with Deputy Durkan.  I welcome the Bill in general, although I fear that it lacks the teeth that are required in this area.  Under the Bill, the functions of the National Consumer Agency will be to publish research, act as an advocate on behalf of the consumer, promote public awareness, impart information to the public, engage in educational activities and generally to raise awareness.  These are fine and laudable functions and, like motherhood and apple pie, one cannot object to them.  However, it lacks teeth and smacks of being a sop to consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2408">The Minister said that the Bill aims to give responsibility to consumers, to empower them and make them more assertive.  In many ways that is nonsense.  Consumers are only as assertive as the law permits them to be.  What is required is real powers of enforcement and they are not in the Bill.  It is a cop-out to hand over to consumers responsibility to defend their own rights.  It is the State, through this agency, that should be defending the consumers' interests.  Only if the agency has strong enforcement rights and powers will this actually happen.  The powers given to the proposed body are those which the Director of Consumer Affairs has had for many years.  The Minister rightly paid tribute to the director.  However, it must be admitted that the consumer has not been well served.  I do not entirely blame the Director of Consumer Affairs for this because the office has neither the powers nor resources to defend the consumer.  No Member can suggest the consumer has been king.</p>
          <p eId="para_2409">The Bill proposes procedures for alternative dispute resolution.  While it is a laudable proposal for the solution of individual cases, what is required is a culture change which is pro-consumer and pro-competition.  If such a culture were established, it would obviate the need for a new dispute resolution forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_2410">The Bill proposes the Minister may consult the agency regarding legislation and the agency can recommend further legislation to the Minister.  While very laudable and desirable, it does not catapult the consumer into a position of power in the way required.</p>
          <p eId="para_2411">The proposed structure of the body gives me most concern.  The agency lacks the independence required to be successful.  It is too much in thrall to the Minister and the Department and will be subject to their wishes.  This body must have a similar independence to that of the Ombudsman, if it truly is to be a champion for consumers and put their interests before those of providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2412">The legislation, as drafted, limits the agency's sphere of influence when it comes to protecting consumers' interests where those interests conflict with sectoral regulators.  Despite the great expectations with sectoral regulators, they have not always served consumers as they should.  There is the ever present danger of regulatory capture.  In these circumstances, to force the new agency to enter into co-operation agreements with various regulators will negate the purpose of the legislation.  For it to operate strictly in the interests of consumers, it should operate independently of the regulators.  Their function is to provide a level playing pitch for producers and providers.  It was hoped they would provide a better deal for consumers but that has not always been the case.  To put them into bed with the new agency is not the way to proceed if the interest of the consumer is to be paramount.  To put the agency in a position where it is in thrall to the Government and subject to narrow political or special interests is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_2413">The enforcement function is inadequate.  Like the Competition Authority, the agency will have the power to investigate.  Having investigative powers, however, is not sufficient.  It should have the powers immediately to close down anti-consumer practices.  The power to act immediately is crucial rather than having to go through the courts.  When such practices come to light, they are once-off, time-related incidents such as the sale of tickets for the recent rugby international.  What went on was scandalous.  The courts are redundant and can give no protection to the consumer in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_2414">Government agencies and protected monopolies have ripped off consumers.  As Deputy Hogan pointed out, the prices of internationally traded goods and services have remained relatively stable in recent years, as those providers must survive in a competitive market.  The prices of goods and services in the protected sectors, particularly Government-traded sectors, have gone through the roof.  Last month inflation went over the 5% mark.</p>

          <p eId="para_2416">If prices have gone up, services have not improved.  Again and again, the special interests of providers have triumphed.  Whether it is hospital consultants or concrete block manufacturers, their special interests come before those of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_2417">The partnership talks involving the trade unions and business interests, which are all in bed with the Government, have decided how the State will be run for the next several years.  The only party not at the negotiating table was the consumer, yet decisions that will have a major impact were made in those talks.  The Government purported to be acting in the consumers' interests but decisions were made that were anti-consumer.  For example, a deal was done preventing driving test instructors being employed, even though 400 people are killed on our roads each year.  A benchmarking deal was struck to improve efficiencies and provide better services from the public service but none were delivered.  It was an exercise in name only.</p>
          <p eId="para_2418">In the transport area, special interests have stymied necessary reforms and inhibited the development of a comprehensive integrated public transport system.  I am surprised we have not yet had a commuter revolution.  Commuters' interests have not been served by the Government or any of the transport agencies purporting to act for them.  No extra buses, integrated ticketing or competing terminals have been provided.  The dominant provider won at the expense of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_2419">In the dying days of the Government, the Bill is a disappointment since so much was expected of it.  It is too timid, a pale imitation of what is needed.  It fails to galvanise the action needed for a clean sweep and change in culture of not rocking the boat or stepping on people's toes.  It ensures there will be no risk of change and avoids the notion that the Government and providers have colluded.  Providers across the board, particularly in the State sector, have colluded with the Government.  Knowingly or unknowingly, willingly or unwillingly, they have acted to the consumer's detriment.  This Bill does not go far enough in changing that culture.</p>

It was a guilt complex activated on the part of the Government, which recognised that it had failed to protect the consumer over the past five years.

          <p eId="para_2423">It takes an appalling brass neck on the Government's part to introduce this Bill now.  Who has protected consumers of petrol and diesel over the last 12 or 14 months?  As prices rose ever higher, from what section of the Government or the consumer protection agencies came plans to protect the unfortunate consumer?  At the same time, gas prices were coming down on world markets and in free fall on others, but in this country we defied the laws of gravity.  The Government and regulator colluded to approve an increase in gas and electricity prices, the like of which had never been known before.</p>
          <p eId="para_2424">Who protected the unfortunate consumer in that case?  No one did so, because the Government did not care.  It could not care less, and the only thing that has pricked its conscious now is that it will shortly go to the people.  Ministers began to scratch their heads, wondering how they could protect themselves.  Without a shadow of a doubt, this Bill represents their answer.  They have laboured and brought forth a mouse.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_2427">My colleague has already given other examples.  In telecommunications, Smart Telecom's subscribers were arbitrarily left without services overnight without warning, protection, compensation or any word of comfort.  Many of the victims are still owed a great deal for services they purchased but never received.  What happened in that case?  There were regulators, bureaucrats, technocrats, plutocrats, and all the other variations thereon, but they did not protect the consumer.  No one acted in the consumer's interests, an extraordinary situation.  All those bodies and quangos, as the late Brian Lenihan would call them in this House, are visible and make noises.  From time to time they move around, coming within one's field of vision or cropping up on the radar screen.  However, when it came to doing what they were meant to do in this situation — protect the unfortunate consumer — they were absent.</p>
          <p eId="para_2428">Regarding services provided by Smart Telecom, for months an argument was going on behind the scenes of which no one was aware.  All of a sudden, the whole edifice collapsed.  Amazingly, with such competition and consumer protection, 80% of customers have reverted to the original service-provider.  Competition and regulators' interventions have achieved little.  The regulatory system as transposed from European into Irish law is failing.  There is a tendency on the part of our negotiators slavishly to follow the lead of their European colleagues.  That may or may not be useful, but it is particularly sensitive in areas such as consumer protection, energy price increases and the provision of telecommunications services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2429">What happened regarding the provision of broadband services?  When was consideration taken of domestic and industrial consumers, and who protected and stood up for them?  Where were those on the various quangos, and the Ministers whose job it was to direct them?  What has ordinarily occurred in such situations is that Ministers have become coy, shy, acting in a hands-off, detached, distracted, disenchanted fashion disconnected from the job they are supposed to do.  It is the unfortunate consumer who suffers, being left unprotected every time and paying through the nose because Ministers do not act.  Neither do the Competition Authority or the consumer protection agencies act, and the consumer is abandoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_2430">The events and experiences of recent years should suffice to galvanise Ministers, were it possible to do so.  However, they are so accustomed to inertia that they are no longer capable.  Alas and alack, the unfortunate consumer must pay.  It is sad that we should see this legislation produced at the 11th hour and the last moment of this Government.  We recognise that it is merely a fig-leaf allowing it to go forth and meet the electorate.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cassidy</from>
          <p eId="para_2435">I have respected the Deputy from Kildare for many years, but as Chairman of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I welcome the Bill before the House.  Any fair-minded person would have to recognise that for the fulfilment of its aims the Consumer Protection Bill 2007 provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of the National Consumer Agency, the transposition into national law of the directive dealing with unfair commercial practices, and the rationalisation and updating of the existing body of consumer law.  It also updates and signally strengthens the law on pyramid selling.</p>
          <p eId="para_2436">I am very pleased and proud of our work on the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business to improve the consumer's lot.  I do not care for which political party Members were elected to the House, but we all agreed that it was the second-greatest challenge following the election, and I was delighted that the Taoiseach accorded me the opportunity and honour of chairing the insurance inquiry.  That covered public liability, employers' liability, private motor and commercial motor insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_2437">At the time, insurance costs had gone through the roof and the consumer was paying excessively.  However, the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business provided a conduit for liaising with the industry itself, with 19 submissions given live on camera.  The committee, led by me, went to the Government and persuaded the Taoiseach to make a commitment.  At our parliamentary party meeting in Sligo the following year, he said that the Government would make insurance its primary legislative issue for 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_2438">The Bill setting up the Personal Injuries Assessment Board has been enacted and the board established.  The Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 have been enacted.  Penalty points, random breath-testing and all those other safety measures on which we made proposals are now also part of the law.  The consumer has been the big winner.  No matter what the insurance policy, premia today have fallen to 1988 prices, allowing for inflation.  That is a marvellous achievement for a committee with members of all political persuasions coming together under the chairmanship of this Government appointee.  We made our presence felt in addressing the difficulties in an industry that affects individuals and small businesses stretched to the limit by insurance costs.  I do not wish to belabour the point but I welcome anything that will strengthen consumer demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_2439">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, who has been forthcoming in assisting me as Chairman of the committee over the past four and a half years.  In fairness to the former Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, I must put on record the truth of what happened over the last four and a half years.  I will give Deputy Durkan credit for one thing — I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for 25 years and both he and his party colleagues have been exemplary in Opposition.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_2444">I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate which has been both interesting and stimulating.  It has demonstrated beyond doubt that the welfare of consumers is an important and topical issue, and that the Government is right to afford this legislation a high priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_2445">Before responding to the comments of individual Deputies, I wish to make a few general remarks.  There has been much talk on the Opposition benches of the need for an ombudsman for consumers and a consumer rights enforcer.  It is a grandiose title but at the end of the day that it all it is — a title.  Whatever one might call a consumer organisation — this legislation gives it the title of National Consumer Agency — the fundamentally important factor is the extent of the powers and functions conferred on that organisation by legislation, and the extent of its duties and obligations to the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_2446">As a result of the enactment of this Bill, Ireland will have the benefit of an extensive and unequivocal list, set down in one statute, of commercial practices which are prohibited because they are unfair to consumers.  In that respect the Bill introduces a much needed modernisation of our consumer laws.  Furthermore, and despite criticisms from the Opposition side of the House, the Bill creates an enforcement agency with real teeth.  Not alone will there be a strengthening of the penalties for breaches of consumer law, particularly for repeat offenders, but the National Consumer Agency is also being given a range of enforcement options not available to its predecessor, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The agency will have power to impose on-the-spot fines and will be able to accept undertakings from traders to comply with the law.  It will be allowed to issue compliance notices to traders who it believes are breaking the rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_2447">In addition, the agency will be able to ask the courts to award compensation to consumers and the courts will have discretion to do this.  The courts will be able to order traders to publish corrective statements but, perhaps most tellingly of all, the agency will be able to publish the names of all those who have broken the rules and been the subject of enforcement action.  This new emphasis on a name and shame policy is a critical element of the enforcement options available to the agency.  It is not only a matter of sanctioning offenders — albeit that naming and shaming is a powerful punishment in itself, particularly if imposed on top of fines handed down by a court — but also of publishing the names of offenders, which represents an important signpost for consumers when it comes to identifying those businesses that may adopt a cavalier approach to consumer rights.  Many businesses for which a financial penalty may be inconsequential, no matter how large, might think twice about breaching these laws if it means losing customers.  I look forward to seeing this particular provision of the Bill in operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2448">The powers in the Bill are as extensive as they are new, and provide alternatives to what can often be expensive and protracted court proceedings.  They will allow agencies to take enforcement action quickly in the best interests of consumers.  The Bill is not just about enforcement, however, and that is why it represents such a fundamental shift in consumer policy.  The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has done an excellent job on behalf of consumers since it was established in 1978.  However, it was largely confined to enforcing the law as handed down to it and was never designed to be an advocate for consumers when it came to designing that law.  As a result, the consumer's voice in this country was weak and uninformed.  When it came to national debate, trade interests were usually best organised, most knowledgeable and best resourced.  Consumers rarely acted as a group and their contribution to the debate was, through no fault of their own, sometimes patchy and inconsistent, while at other times entirely non-existent.  That will all change with the passage of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2449">The National Consumer Agency will have a statutory right to comment on the implications for consumers of existing and proposed legislation.  It will be resourced to carry out research and will be empowered to access information from other regulators so that it can always speak from an informed position on behalf of consumers.  The agency will have a statutory role to educate and inform consumers, and to promote public awareness of consumer issues.  These duties go some way beyond the remit of the ODCA and signal a new era for consumer protection.  The emphasis is very much on empowering consumers, letting them know their rights, and encouraging them to be assertive and stand up for those rights.   It is about providing remedies and redress when those rights are denied, but the legislation is also about encouraging traders to be fair, equitable and transparent in their dealings with customers.  Businesses should regard a satisfied customer as a valuable business asset, and be prepared to work at guaranteeing that satisfaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_2450">Deputy Hogan referred to his party's own Private Members' Bill which was voted down in the House.  That Bill did not go nearly as far as this one in preventing unfair trading practices and empowering a consumer enforcement agency.  Neither did it make any effort to transpose the unfair commercial practices directive, which would have left us in breach of EU obligations.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_2452">That is what we are doing.  I want to respond to allegations that this Government has somehow neglected consumers.  I reject the suggestion made in the debate that we have been slow in bringing the Bill forward or that we are only doing so because of rules forced on us by Brussels.  The notion that Brussels legislates while member states stand idly by in the wings, meekly accepting whatever edict is eventually handed down, is nonsense and shows a lack of understanding of how the European Union works.  Member states themselves contribute to the design of legislation and our public representatives all have their say in the eventual outcome through the involvement of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  Ireland contributed as much as anybody else to the negotiation of the unfair commercial practices directive.  It includes many thoughts and ideas which this Administration brought to the debate.  EU legislation is not some sort of <i>fait accompli</i> and it is unfair to those who participate in the negotiation process to suggest that it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_2453">This is major legislation which repeals nine existing statutes and completely reforms our domestic consumer laws.  Major legislative reform on this scale does not happen overnight; it is the result of many months of dedicated hard work on the part of officials in my Department, those in other Departments and the Attorney General's office, and the office of the parliamentary counsel.  To devalue that work by suggesting that it could have been done sooner does a disservice to all those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_2454">I would also dispute the contention by a number of Deputies that Parts 3 and 4 of the Bill simply copy out the provision of the unfair commercial practices directive.  Although we were obviously constrained by the maximum harmonisation status of the directive, any considered comparison of the texts of the Bill and the directive will show significant differences.  The directive's provision on pyramid schemes, for example, numbers just 42 words.  By contrast, Part 4 of the Bill on pyramid schemes includes three substantial sections and is over ten times the length of the directive's provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_2455">Deputy Hogan also referred to the current rate of inflation.  Rising inflation is a cause of concern to all governments and many of the factors contributing to Ireland's current high rate of inflation are outside the Government's control.  Higher international energy costs, rising commodity prices on global markets, poor crop harvests and declining fish stocks are all factors contributing to higher prices.  Where it can take action, in areas such as grocery prices and insurance costs, the Government has introduced remedial measures that have had a significant impact.  We are committed to improving competition in the economy and improving the competitive environment for industry.  The forthcoming White Paper on energy will address the strategic challenges facing us in that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_2456">When this Government sought to remove one of the principal causes of high grocery prices, Fine Gael and others fought the proposal tooth and nail.  Some, like Deputy Morgan, are still fighting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2457">Deputy Hogan complained about a plethora of regulators and their lack of concern for the welfare of consumers.  The National Consumer Agency can be a thorn in the side of regulators when they appear not to be acting in the best interests of consumers.  The agency will be empowered and resourced to be a strong advocate for consumers with regard to the activities of regulated sectors and the regulators.</p>
          <p eId="para_2458">Deputies Hogan and Morgan both expressed concern at the duplication of the activities of regulators.  If the Deputies have read section 21 of the Bill they will recognise that it is designed to avoid any such duplication.</p>
          <p eId="para_2459">Some Deputies, including Deputies Hogan and Upton, referred to the decision to revoke the groceries order this time last year.  There have been conflicting views, not only in this House but among commentators in the media, as to the effect of this decision on grocery prices.  Based on figures from the Central Statistics Office grocery items previously covered by the order have declined in price by 1.2% since last April, when the order was removed.  Items not previously covered, mainly fresh meat, fish and vegetables, have increased in price by 2.4%.  These are fresh products so, historically, their prices have tended to fluctuate to a greater extent than prepared or packaged foods.</p>
          <p eId="para_2460">Nonetheless, the overall statistics for a combination of grocery goods covered and not covered by the order show a decline in prices of 0.4% since the order was removed.  The Government never predicted that prices would decline and it would be foolish to make such predictions because so many factors impact on prices that one cannot predict a future trend for any category of goods.  The prediction made was that grocery products would be cheaper in the future without the order than with it.  The question that should concern us is how much more expensive our grocery prices could be today had the order remained.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_2462">In order to provide a proper answer it is necessary to examine what the order did.  The groceries order stopped retailers competing and allowed wholesalers to fix minimum prices for grocery products.  This is known as price fixing and is an offence under our competition laws.  Deputies will be aware that in the recent past a number of individuals have been subjected to criminal sanctions for engaging in such activities in other sectors.  The groceries order not alone legalised price fixing in the grocery sector, it made it compulsory.</p>
          <p eId="para_2463">There was a general consensus that Ireland was among the most expensive countries in Europe in which to buy groceries and all of the evidence suggested the order contributed to this.  While CSO figures show that prices are moving in the right direction the real impact of removing the order will be felt over time as new entrants join the market, existing smaller participants expand their operations and competition among retailers increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_2464">Deputies Hogan and Upton asked about the resources of the new National Consumer Agency.  It will have a budget that, when combined with that of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, ODCA, will amount to €8.4 in 2007.  Future allocations will depend on the work programme devised by the board of the agency and will be decided as part of the Estimates process.  This year's budget is almost twice that available to the ODCA in its own right and the NCA will have its own staff so I reject any suggestion of a lack of independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_2465">Deputy Hogan asked about the application of this Bill to business to consumer transactions.  This is a key part of the unfair commercial practice directive and we cannot go beyond its terms.  However, it is also right that the NCA's resources and enforcement efforts should focus on consumers, and not be deflected to matters concerning business to business transactions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2466">Deputy Hogan also wondered about efforts to restrict the rights of the NCA when appearing before Oireachtas committees.  There is no intention to do this and Deputy Hogan might like to know that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, will be sympathetic to an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage.  The NCA will be empowered to conduct and publish price surveys for the benefit of consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2467">Deputy Upton referred to the impact consumers in the UK have had on banks and banking fees and I agree entirely that this is a good example of how consumers can yield considerable powers when they act in concert.  I encourage Irish consumers to learn from the experience of UK consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2468">Deputy Upton also referred to food labelling, in particular the marking of origin on food products, and I sympathise with her views.  However, this is primarily a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan.  While the Bill does not include a general prohibition on misleading consumers regarding the geographical origin of products, the NCA will enforce this provision and will be an advocate for stronger regulation in this area if it sees it as warranted.  The NCA will be empowered to liaise with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland with regard to the issues raised by Deputy Upton.</p>
          <p eId="para_2469">I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Upton had to say, especially as she highlighted a number of important consumer issues related to food labelling.  Many of these issues will be examined by the NCA when it is established on a statutory footing because the Bill gives the agency this power.</p>
          <p eId="para_2470">I agree with Deputy Upton's comments on ringtones and the ODCA tackled this issue with a good deal of success but the NCA will remain vigilant with regard to such practices.  The cross-border aspect of the unfair commercial practices directive, UCPD, allows for co-operation with enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions to tackle such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_2471">The issue of policing consumer protection in the area of Internet trading was raised.  This is an increasingly popular way of transacting business and the provisions of the Bill apply to Internet trading as they do to all other forms of trading.  EU cross-border infrastructure allows for co-operation between enforcement agencies in different jurisdictions making for easier policing of the activities of Internet traders throughout the 27 member states.  This type of transaction is also governed by an EU distance selling directive that is currently being reviewed by the European Commission.  My Department will actively participate in that review.</p>
          <p eId="para_2472">Deputy Morgan inquired about estate agents and the practice of arranging ghost bids on properties.  This will be prohibited by section 43(2)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_2473">Regarding Deputy McHugh's point, local authority services for which a charge is made are covered by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_2474">I thank the Deputies who have taken part in the debate on this Bill which was supported on all sides of the House.  I thank the officials for the work they did in recent months and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_2477">This issue is very important and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for placing it on the agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_2478">Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, is the major acute hospital for the region and the majority of regional services are based there.  The hospital represents a critical mass of consultants, doctors and nurses for the region and its future is in doubt following the Teamwork report.  I tabled the motion because I want to know the nature of the process being used to determine the location of the new acute hospital the Health Service Executive proposes to build in the north east.  This process must be transparent and open.  What criteria will be used?  Will the public have direct access to the consultants who will produce a report and make a recommendation?</p>
            <p eId="para_2479">Members of the public have a democratic right to express their views and have an input in the democratic process.  Political accountability for the eventual decision is needed at Cabinet level.  Having met last week with the chairperson of the implementation group and the acute hospital manager for the north east, Mr. Lyons, I rang the HSE yesterday to ask what process would be used in selecting a site for the new hospital and how members of the public could secure direct access to the consultants.  I was informed by the HSE that the matter was "under consideration" and it could not guarantee that a public consultation process would take place.  It could not tell me what was the truth of the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2480">A lack of transparency, accountability and openness lies at the heart of the Government.  People in Drogheda are extremely angry and concerned that the formula for progressing the process does not include a procedure to allow them to make representations regarding the consultants' report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2481">The recent HSE report examining the current level of services at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda did not consider as a potential hospital site a property owned by the Medical Missionaries of Mary and located adjacent to the Lourdes Hospital site, nor did it examine the possibility of relocating two primary schools immediately adjacent to the hospital.  It did not consider using GAA grounds, which are currently up for sale, 20 acres of land owned by the HSE in the area or soccer grounds located immediately adjacent to the hospital.  The Health Service Executive has not objectively considered Drogheda as a site for the new hospital or examined all available sites immediately beside the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2482">People in Drogheda are up in arms and deeply concerned that the hospital will be moved to wherever our political masters or the unaccountable and undemocratic Health Service Executive decide.  They are extremely angry and will vote on this issue in the forthcoming general election.</p>
            <p eId="para_2483">I make my comments without knowing what will be the Minister of State's response.  People in south County Louth and Drogheda and the staff of 1,500 who work in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, will not be moved by an undemocratic and unaccountable HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_2484">I will take the adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_2485">The Health Service Executive established a steering group and project group to oversee a programme designed to improve safety and standards for patients in the north-east region.  The decision was taken having regard to the issues raised in the report prepared for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services, Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East.</p>

            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_2487">I will address the Deputy's concern in a moment.  The Teamwork report included a number of recommendations to improve patient care in the region.  It specifically highlighted the need to develop a high quality, responsive emergency and planned service in line with international standards.  It recommended that there be one major regional hospital in the north east supported by five local hospitals.  The new hospital is to provide emergency and trauma services on a 24-hour basis and planned specialist procedures which are complex and require the facilities of a large regional hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2488">The hospital reconfiguration process is being overseen by the HSE steering group which is leading the project.  No decision has been made to date on the location of the new hospital.  A sub-committee of the steering group has been established to progress the issue of site selection.  A consultancy is to be awarded shortly for an independent site location study.  The study will take account of various criteria, including demographics, access, planning and development considerations and interdependencies.  The HSE expects the consultancy will be awarded by the end of March, with an eight-week timeframe thereafter to undertake the study and produce a report for the executive recommending a location for the new hospital.</p>

            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_2490">A key element of this process will involve the Health Service Executive inviting the public and other interested parties to make a submission on the hospital location.  The HSE will place advertisements in the national and local newspapers in the north east shortly and submissions will be analysed by the consultancy as part of the location study.  The consultancy will produce an independent report, which will be submitted to the steering group and then brought to the management team of the HSE and the HSE board for consideration.  It is expected that the recommendation of the board will be brought when this process is complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_2491">It should be emphasised that the HSE has given the Minister an assurance that, in progressing the re-organisation of services in the north east, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>

          <speech by="#BreedaMoynihanCronin" eId="spk_478">
            <from>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</from>
            <p eId="para_2493">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue.  I bring to the attention of the House the chronic circumstances in the maternity unit in Kerry General Hospital in Tralee, which should shame and embarrass the Minister for Health and Children and other members of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2494">The maternity unit in Kerry General Hospital is bursting at the seams.  While the delivery rate at the unit has increased dramatically in recent years, staff numbers and facilities have not changed and are completely inadequate.  Since 1999, for example, the number of births recorded annually at the unit has increased from approximately 1,000 to more than 1,600 but there has not been a corresponding increase in the number of personnel or level of facilities available to cater for and cope with the increased birth rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">The position is so grave that the maternity unit is experiencing a shortage of cots for newborn babies.  I understand that in some cases new mothers are required to look after their newborn babies 24 hours per day for the first few days after birth because of the shortage of nursery beds.  This places them under untold pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2496">I am sorry to report that staff shortages at Kerry General Hospital have resulted in Polish women living in County Kerry returning home to have ante-natal scans.  The waiting time for an ante-natal appointment in Tralee averages 24 weeks, which is longer than Polish women living here need to secure an appointment in Poland.  We have reached the stage, in our booming economy, that we are sending women who live here to the other side of Europe for maternity appointments.  Irishwomen have no facility to arrange an appointment elsewhere and must wait for 24 weeks.  This waiting time is appalling.</p>
            <p eId="para_2497">The problems at the maternity unit in Kerry General Hospital do not end there.  Despite an increase of 50% in the number of births in the hospital, it does not have dietitians or counsellors to attend to the needs of new mothers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and his colleagues have done nothing in the past decade to alleviate pressures experienced in the maternity unit of the hospital.  Despite receiving the first submission from the hospital requesting a new maternity unit more than four years ago, no progress has been made.  A new maternity unit is urgently needed and would free up 40 beds for use elsewhere in the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">Unfortunately, maternity services are not the only crisis facing the hospital.  No full-time accident and emergency consultant has been in place for more than a year, the accident and emergency department and other departments are experiencing major bed shortages and no progress has been made on extending the accident and emergency department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">I need answers from the Government outlining how it proposes to address the ongoing crisis at the maternity unit of Kerry General Hospital.  It is an abomination that no progress has been made on this facility after ten years.  How much longer must the women of County Kerry wait?  It is unacceptable that they must wait for 24 weeks for an ante-natal appointment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_479" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_2501">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  The department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Kerry General Hospital provides a range of ante-natal and post-natal services, including a foetal assessment unit, early pregnancy clinics, outpatient clinics, breast-feeding support, physiotherapy services and discharge classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2502">The HSE has advised that the department of obstetrics and gynaecology has experienced a significant increase in demand for its services in recent years.  The executive has further advised that a capital projects development team was established by the management of Kerry General Hospital in September 2000, which prepared a strategy plan for the current and future needs of the hospital.  The construction of a purpose built maternity unit was included in the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2503">The provision of a new maternity unit at Kerry General Hospital was considered for inclusion in the HSE capital plan for 2006 as part of the rolling capital programme for 2006-10.  Due to competing demands for capital funding, however, including other significant capital projects in the Kerry area, this project was not prioritised for inclusion in the capital plan that was approved by the HSE board and the Minister for Health and Children.  It is a matter for the HSE to consider the progression of the new maternity unit at Kerry General Hospital in the context of overall capital and revenue funding resources available to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2504">The recent report by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists refers to the future of maternity and gynaecology services in Ireland.  The report sets out the institute's views on a range of issues including, for example, the need to develop clinical maternity networks throughout the State.  The HSE will have regard to the institute's findings in developing these services.</p>

          <heading>Nursing Home Subventions.</heading>
          <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_480">
            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_2505">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for debate.  I look forward to some answers from the Minister of State in regard to the nursing home subvention scheme.  It is my understanding that changes to legislation should improve the lot of citizens, most especially in matters relating to the welfare of the elderly.  The recent changes to the legislation on nursing home subventions, however, have been particularly hurtful for elderly people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2506">The situation prior to 1 January 2007 was that subvention was paid at a rate of €190 per week.  Patients then contributed some €180 per week from their pensions, retaining €40, or €42 if they were over 80 years old.  This gave a total of €370, with an additional enhanced subvention being met by the HSE to give a total of €650, which met the average cost of a bed in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  Since 1 January, however, the nursing home subvention was increased to €300.  Patients must still contribute €180 from their  pension, giving an amount of €480, and the shortfall of €170 must be met by the patients or their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">I understand the information I have supplied is correct.  The first casualty in this new situation will be the few euro in pocket money that is left to patients every week.  This will effectively be stolen by the HSE as the extra charge is imposed on patients and their families.  The average cost of a bed in the Cavan-Monaghan area is anywhere between €650 and €800 per week but the HSE has set a minimal rate of €540.  I cannot understand this.  Many of the staff who must deliver these subvention programmes are unhappy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">It is unfortunate that the contract is between the patient and the nursing home and that the HSE has stepped out of the way.  I have spoken to nursing home owners who say their prices will increase, if they have not already done so, because of the rising cost of oil, gas and electricity and as a result of rising staff wages.  I heard of one nursing home with some 50 beds where the wages bill alone will increase by €100,000 per annum.  In such circumstances, it is inevitable that the cost of beds will increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_2509">Another difficulty relates to the processing of subvention payments in general hospitals.  Time is often wasted in trying to identify whether a patient is entitled to subvention, during which time a bed continues to be occupied in the hospital.  When a patient is in hospital his or her charges are met by that hospital but it is a different situation when the patient enters a nursing home, where a different budget is in operation.  There is constant internal wrangling about who pays for what.  It is little wonder we have difficulties in Beaumont Hospital, for instance, given that one in six beds there are occupied by patients who are already fit for discharge.  Many such patients remain there for three months or more at a high cost to the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_2510">Attempts to deal with this problem between August 2005 and December 2006 focused on five discharge initiatives.  These initiatives helped to free up beds in Beaumont Hospital but people with elderly relatives realise quickly that if there is one discharge initiative followed by four others, it is most likely there will be further such initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">Discharge initiatives are favourable to patients.  It pays them to stay in the hospital bed because there is no means testing of discharge initiative patients.  They are asked only to contribute €120 per week from their pension on an ongoing basis.  This is not the way forward.  We must ensure there are more nursing home beds in the community.  Another difficulty is that some nursing homes are charging more than €1,200 per week for a bed.  It is not the best use of health service resources to subsidise such a luxurious level of accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2512">It is vital that more geriatricians are appointed in the health service.  In County Meath, for example, there is not one geriatrician available to patients.  This has knock-on effects.  It is unacceptable that patients should have to wait up to 18 months for geriatrician appointments and occupational therapy assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2513">Hospice cover is also required for patients at weekends.  Such patients receive excellent care from Monday to Friday but those families who wish to look after their relatives at home are isolated at weekends.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_481" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_2514">I will take this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising the question as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the improvements made to the nursing home subvention scheme.  The scheme was introduced in 1993 to assist with the cost of private nursing home fees.  A subvention may be paid where a person has been assessed as needing nursing home care by the Health Service Executive and where he or she has satisfied a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">Since 1 January 2007, there are no longer three separate rates of subvention.  Persons who apply may receive any amount up to a maximum of €300 per week.  Additional funding of €55 million was provided for this purpose in budget 2007.  The change in the rate means that as many as 1,800 people not previously eligible for subvention may now qualify for a payment.  In addition, the HSE has finalised national guidelines for the standardised implementation of the nursing home subvention scheme.  These were circulated on 29 January 2007 to all subvention officers working in local health offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">Nothing in the guidelines shall operate in a way that is inconsistent with the proposed new scheme for 2008, A Fair Deal.  Furthermore, nothing shall worsen an applicant's overall position in 2007 by comparison with 2006.  Under the guidelines, the assessment of means will now be carried out using a national standard financial assessment method.  This should address past complaints about inconsistency in the administration of the scheme and the amounts of subvention paid from place to place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2517">The guidelines detail a number of improvements to the subvention scheme, all of which are consistent with the proposed new scheme, A Fair Deal.  First, the means assessment process will ensure that a remaining spouse or partner is not left with less than the current maximum rate of the non-contributory State pension.  A further improvement is that the HSE will cease imputing income from the principal private residence where it has already been imputed for three or more years.  This is again consistent with the new scheme.  In addition, the HSE will not automatically exclude individuals from applying for subvention, and consequently from the means assessment process, on the basis of the property or asset thresholds.  Everyone will be eligible to undertake the means assessment process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">In addition to the increased rate of basic subvention, additional funding of €30 million has been made available in 2007 for enhanced subvention.  This is a supplementary subvention that may be paid by the HSE to a person in or entering private long-term care.  The amount of enhanced subvention paid is at the discretion of the HSE and varies according to the cost of care and the circumstances of the applicant.  The additional enhanced subvention will be used to develop a consistency between the payment of subvention during 2007 and the new nursing home support scheme for 2008, and to work towards equalisation of the level of support paid to people in different areas, taking local prices and a person's means into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_2519">The HSE guidelines provide that it is not necessary to qualify for a basic subvention payment in order to apply for an enhanced subvention payment.  However, an applicant for enhanced subvention will be subject to the means assessment.  In light of the above improvements, the HSE is reassessing all those already in receipt of a nursing home subvention.  I advise people in private nursing homes who do not currently receive a subvention payment to apply to the HSE for an assessment.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_482">
            <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
            <p eId="para_2520">I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to take this matter.  This is an extraordinary situation.  In early 2004, 16 hectares of land were made available to Cork County Council to provide affordable houses to people in west Cork.  From the outset, this land, in an idyllic setting beside a church and school in a local village, was ideal for the provision of housing for those who cannot afford to purchase a site and build their own house.  The Fine Gael councillors in west Cork, however, tried to prevent the scheme.  I want the Minister of State and the Department to ensure that three years later, this project will commence.  Not a sod has been turned so far.</p>
            <p eId="para_2521">The entire project was frustrated and every possible obstacle put in its way from the outset, something I find astonishing after a quarter of a century in public life.  A total of 16 hectares of prime land was made available and the architectural department in Cork County Council put its expertise and professionalism to work, designing a beautiful eco-village where young people could make a home in a location with every facility for children and adults.  Out of nothing short of rural snobbery, the local Fine Gael councillors decided to stop this because they did not want to lower the tone of the area.  It is incredible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2522">This culminated on 22 May 2006 in a motion before a meeting of Cork County Council to allow the scheme to go ahead. An amendment was put down by Councillor Maura Cal McCarthy, seconded by Councillor Kevin Murphy, to reject this eco-village at Darrara, Clonakilty, County Cork.  A vote was taken and Councillors K. Murphy, Kelly, Ryan, Canty, Pyne, O'Doherty, M. Murphy, Buckley, Sheahan and McCarthy voted against it.  Thankfully a majority of the council voted in favour.  To this day, however, the project is progressing at a snail's pace and no work has been done on the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_2523">I want to ensure the people in the area I represent can get an affordable home of their own and that the land in this idyllic village is put at their disposal.  I would like a commitment from the Minister of State that the Department will ensure the project will go ahead despite the obstruction of the Fine Gael councillors.  It is so incredible. In my 25 years in this House representing the people of Cork South-West, I have never come across anything like it.  It is down to nothing other than sheer rural snobbery, not wanting to bring what Fine Gael would regard as people who are looking for social or affordable housing into a locality where they would lower the tone.  I reject that.</p>
            <p eId="para_2524">This means nothing to me politically, I am not standing in the next election, but I want to ensure before leaving public life that this project goes ahead.  I have only until May and I want the Minister of State who has responsibility for affordable housing schemes to give me a commitment that the project will go ahead.  There will only be 100 houses but it is vital that local people have a chance to buy their own homes and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government pushes ahead with this project.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_483">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2525">I thank Deputy Walsh for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2526">The site in Clonakilty was one of the sites released to the affordable housing initiative announced in December 2003.  It was released by Deputy Walsh during his tenure as Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I acknowledge that fact because the Deputy and the Department were helpful at the time in putting forward a number of sites for the initiative.  The support and co-operation of Deputy Walsh and the Department were significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">Lead responsibility for planning and developing this project rests with Cork County Council and officials in the Department are in regular contact with the council to ensure the project is advanced as quickly as possible.  On completion of the development, the site will comprise a mix of affordable, social, voluntary and private homes, with 74 of the 104 homes being made available under the initiative.  Affordable homes are private homes.  There are people who try to mix them up with other forms of housing.  They come with a discount but they are private homes owned by those who move into them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">I appreciate the Deputy's concerns about the lack of pace in progress on this project.  I am anxious to see the project moving ahead as quickly as possible and that is the basis on which my Department is engaging with Cork County Council on the matter.  We want this to happen quickly.  From the time a site is acquired, it can take a couple of years before houses are ready for people to move in but progress in this scheme has been painfully slow.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">A crucial stage in advancing this project is the completion of the design phase and the submission of an application under Part VIII of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 for the approval of the elected members before it can proceed.  Having advertised for expressions of interest for the preparation of the relevant documentation required for the Part VIII process, and for the preparation of cost plans, tender documentation and the construction contract, the council will be holding interviews on 23 March.  This should allow for consultants to be appointed in April, clearing the way for the commencement of the Part VIII preparatory work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2530">The successful completion of the Part VIII process will determine the date that construction can commence on the site.  Given the central role of the elected members of the council in this regard, I urge the councillors to engage proactively with council officials with a view to expediting the matter.  I assure the Deputy that the Department will also continue to monitor progress and liaise with the council to ensure the project is completed as speedily as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2531">Throughout the process to date, I have stressed the importance of avoiding any unnecessary delays and ensuring, where feasible, that processes are paralleled.  That, unfortunately, has not happened.  When the plan went through in May 2006, I thought the Part VIII process would proceed quickly, but here we are talking about doing it nine months later.  At every stage, for whatever reason, be it council members or officials, we are moving at a snail's pace.  The election is coming and because Deputy Walsh was so centrally involved in granting the site, some council members are determined there will be no sign of the houses starting before the election.  The Department, however, is determined this will commence and that is what will happen.  Given that things have gone so slowly, they will not start now because the Part VIII process will take a number of months and we need the co-operation of the members.  They have probably boxed themselves into a corner and will not be able to do it within that timeframe.  However, life does not end whenever the election takes place in May or June.  The Department is determined that this work will proceed and it will keep pressing the matter.  The Government originally designated this site as part of the affordable housing initiative in December 2003.  It is very disappointing that we have not yet got planning.  However, it will happen.  I hope the people down there and all elected representatives will be in a different mood once the election is over.  Regardless of who might be Minister, the Department will continue to push to get those badly needed houses built.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2533">I assume that the figure quoted by the Deputy is derived from recently available Census results.  As the Deputy will be aware, interpretation of any such figures must take account of a range of factors, including population increase, levels of immigration, etc. I understand that analysis by the CSO of data relating to Irish language competence in 2004 indicated that 36.7% of the population over the age of 3 did not have such competence, while 38.7% of the population were reported as speaking Irish on a daily basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2534">The Government's policy is to increase awareness and use of the Irish language as a Community language on a phased basis.  Its specific aim is to ensure that as many of our citizens as possible are bilingual in Irish and in English.  The intention is not to displace the English language but to strengthen the Irish language.  In many European countries, it is a normal occurrence that people are bilingual.  The vision for Ireland is similar, with both English and Irish being widely used on a daily basis throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">As I have already outlined to the House, the Government published a Statement on the Irish Language on 19 December last. The Government's position with regard to the promotion and development of the Irish language is set out in that Statement.  The Statement also commits the Government to the development of a twenty-year strategy based on the 13 objectives outlined in the Statement. I have indicated the arrangements that have been made in relation to the preparation of such a strategy and these matters are currently being addressed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2542">I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 85, 108 and 142 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2543">While I am aware of the Dublin City University report referred to by the Deputies, I do not consider that anything of significance can be concluded on the basis of the information therein.</p>
            <p eId="para_2544">The sample of notes used would appear to have been quite small and such surveys can give dramatic outturns, particularly given the potential for cross-contamination of banknotes.  The results are not dissimilar to those recorded in London in 1999 — and Spain in 2003 — when 99% and 94% of banknotes tested showed traces of cocaine.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">The follow-up survey by Citywide, "Cocaine in Local Communities", is a welcome contribution to our overall knowledge in this area, particularly in the Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) areas involved in the survey.  While drawing attention to increased prevalence of cocaine, this survey also stresses the steps being taken at local level, with funding from my Department, to address the evolving situation.  Furthermore, while more than half of drug treatment projects involved reported seeing clients with cocaine as their main drug, the numbers coming forward for treatment for cocaine addiction is still low.  The report also stresses the physical and mental health problems arising for cocaine users as well as the financial and legal problems and the knock-on effects on families and communities.  In fact, I have repeatedly stressed these issues myself in the context of so-called "recreational" or "week-end" cocaine users and the glamorising of cocaine in some quarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">At my request, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) and the National Drug Strategy Team (NDST) recently prepared a joint briefing paper on cocaine, based on existing data in Ireland.  The paper, which is due to be published next week, concluded that all data sources indicated an upward trend in cocaine use.  A number of recommendations are made in the paper, principally in regard to treatment, but also covering supply, prevention and research.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">A key conclusion of the report is that treatment, primarily in the form of counselling, can and does work and, in this context, the provision of some cocaine specific clinics in areas where cocaine problems are more acute is being considered.  However, in the broader context, I am of the view that we should work towards having drug services that can cater for the individual problem drug user, regardless of the drugs they use.</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">Another key recommendation relates to the training of frontline personnel to deal with cocaine issues.  I have already funded a training initiative in this regard, as well as four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use. The outcomes of those projects which have been completed are being examined at present to see to what extent they can inform the way forward.  Furthermore, I have funded six cocaine specific projects under the LDTF Emerging Needs Fund and the NDST, along with the Drug Task Forces, will continue to review the needs in communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">As regards funding, I am delighted with the 16% increase to tackle drug misuse now confirmed for 2007, especially as it follows on from significant increases in the previous two years.  The allocation of €50m shows an increase of 87% on the corresponding figure for 2004.  Furthermore, the Deputies should note that the €50m in my Department's Vote is only part of an overall allocation of well over €200m provided by the Government across a number of other Departments to tackle the drugs problem this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">Meanwhile, work on the second all-island Drugs Prevalence Survey is in progress and it is expected that preliminary results will be available in the latter part of this year.  This will give much greater clarity on the overall prevalence of cocaine.</p>
            <p eId="para_2551">The challenges posed by cocaine use are significant but I am confident that we can meet these challenges through a co-ordinated approach utilising the structures of the National Drugs Strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2555">I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 98 and 134 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2556">Currently, there is provision for 2,600 participants and a further 130 supervisors on the Rural Social Scheme (RSS).  While all of the available places have now been allocated, Implementing Bodies have been encouraged to form a waiting list of suitable eligible applicants, which can then be used to fill vacancies as and when they arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2557">Since its introduction, the Scheme has become a key part of many rural communities and is very popular with both participants and local sponsors. While communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fisher persons, participants also have the opportunity to improve existing, or develop new skills and perform valuable work in their local communities.  In this context, the Deputies should note that funding for the RSS for the period 2007-2013 is included in the National Development Plan which clearly confirms the Government's continued and on-going commitment to the Scheme in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2558">In relation to countryside recreation, the RSS provides the personnel and capital for projects relating to the maintenance and enhancement of way marked ways, agreed walks, bog roads etc. In general this work involves (i) erecting and maintaining walkway furniture such as fencing, footpaths, stiles, footbridges, drainage channels, signs, benches and facilities for disposal of litter etc; and (ii) carrying out path repair and upgrading.</p>
            <p eId="para_2559">In this context, an amount of €0.6m was made available to Fáilte Ireland under the RSS for the development of 40 looped walks in 2006.  A further €1.5m will be available in 2007 for capital work under the Scheme and my Department will be writing to the Implementing Bodies very shortly advising them of funding available this year.  I envisage that the RSS will continue to play a significant role in the development of countryside recreation into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2560">With regard to Co. Roscommon, the RSS in North, North East and North West Roscommon areas is implemented by Arigna Catchment Area Community Company Ltd and in Mid and South Roscommon by Mid South Roscommon Rural Development Company Ltd.

            <p eId="para_2582">In any event, I would be of the view that legislation on the lines suggested would be very difficult to implement.  Problems would arise in relation to the definition of incitement and the likelihood is that the burden of proof would be very onerous.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2584">I am aware of the approach adopted in the Netherlands, which facilitates the use of cannabis under specific conditions, and in Portugal, where there is an emphasis on dealing with problem drug users through treatment procedures rather than through the courts in the first instance.  However, these approaches have not been taken into account in shaping the current National Drugs Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">It is my view that a change in the law regarding the use of drugs would not be of benefit in tackling drug misuse in Ireland.  With respect to an international perspective on whether a policy of containment works, the United Nations Office for Drugs Control (UNODC), in its 2006 report, argues that there is ample evidence that the approach of making drugs illegal, which is broadly adopted internationally, is effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_2586">The Mid-Term Review of the National Drugs Strategy (NDS), which was published in 2005, found that the current aims and objectives of the Strategy are fundamentally sound and that progress is being made across all of the pillars.  In this context, the Deputy should note that while an extensive public consultation process was undertaken as part of the review, the question of decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs were not raised as issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2587">Illegal drug use is a global issue and so our efforts to tackle it in Ireland must be seen in that context.  The benign approach to cannabis in the Netherlands, for instance, has lead to what is referred to as "drug tourism" with undesirable consequences for that country and for nearby countries.  Against this background, and given the more widespread support for making drugs illegal across Europe, it is my view that a change in the law regarding the possession of, say, cannabis would be of no benefit whatsoever in tackling drug use here — in fact, I would be concerned that it might aggravate the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_2588">While cannabis may not be as dangerous as some other drugs, the evidence is that it is damaging to the physical and mental health of the user, particularly the young and those who are heavy users.  A recent report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs emphasises these points.  It is my view that the legalisation of such drugs would lead to greater levels of usage with associated health problems.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2590">The Deputy will appreciate that primary responsibility for drug treatment rests with my colleague, Mary Harney T.D., the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2591">However, I understand that the Health Service Executive (HSE) provides addiction services in nine locations in the Midlands region. The range of services provided includes methadone maintenance, counselling, education/awareness programmes and referral services to community, mental health and hospital services. The HSE also provides intervention programmes for the families of substance misusers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2592">As of December 2006, there were 8,101 people in receipt of methadone treatment of which, 244, were being treated in the Midlands region.  I understand that there are 51 people on the waiting list for treatment — 36 in Athlone and 15 in Portlaoise.  The HSE is working to address this waiting list, particularly by endeavouring to encourage GPs into the methadone treatment programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2593">The HSE continues to expand the range of options available to individuals in response to needs as they present.  Meanwhile, the on-going implementation of the Midland Regional Drug Task Force Action Plan, which I launched last November, will result in some expansion of harm reduction-type initiatives that will complement the mainstream addiction treatment service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2594">The matter of increased drug dealing by drug misusers is primarily a matter for my colleague, Michael McDowell T.D., Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  He assures me, however, that the Garda Síochána invoke a number of broad strategic responses to address the issue of drug trafficking in all parts of the country and in all its forms.  A key to this is working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_2595">In this context, the Deputy should note that in line with the provisions of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, joint policing committees (JPCs) bringing together representatives from the local authorities, An Garda Síochána, public representatives and representatives of the community and voluntary sectors are being established in each of the 114 local authority administrative areas throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2596">Four Midland centres, Offaly County Council, Tullamore, Birr and Edenderry Town Councils, are among a number of centres where pilot JPCs have been established.  A primary function of these committees is to serve as a forum for consultation, discussion and recommendations on local policing matters and to keep under review levels of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour, including the patterns and levels of misuse of alcohol and drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2597">Finally, in relation to drug-related deaths, I understand that the HSE is not aware of an increased number of drug overdoses in the Midlands.  In line with commitments in the National Drugs Strategy, a National Drug-Related Death Index is being established.  This will give us a clearer view of the situation on the ground and will facilitate the development of health and social service responses aimed at reducing the number of such deaths.</p>

            <p eId="para_2599">My Department is committed to relocating 140 posts to new headquarters at Knock Airport which we expect to see completed in late 2008.  To further the decentralisation process, 70 posts have been assigned to temporary offices in Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo which opened in July last year. The intention is that these posts will be relocated to Knock Airport when the new building is ready.</p>
            <p eId="para_2600">Of the 10 posts due to decentralise to Na Forbacha, Galway, 9 have already relocated there and it is expected that the remaining post will be in place later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2602">The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated RAPID areas.  In addition, in 2006 RAPID priority status was extended to Ballyfermot.  My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2603">The House will be aware that I introduced the RAPID Leverage Schemes in 2004. Under these schemes, my Department provides funds with other Departments and agencies to provide small-scale local projects such as playgrounds, traffic measures, improved health facilities, CCTV, and top-up funds for projects promoted by sporting organisations under the Sports Capital Programme.  In 2006 the terms and conditions of the Playgrounds leverage scheme were extended to enable multi-use games areas or MUGAs to be funded.  I believe this initiative has been a very welcome addition to the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2604">The four designated RAPID areas in Cork City have been allocated a total of over €2.6 million since 2004.  The details are set out in the following tables.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_493">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2720">I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 125, 129 and 145 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2721">Overall Garda figures for 2006 relating to drugs have yet to be finalised and we must await the annual report of An Garda Síochána for last year before a final judgement can be made on the overall level of seizures across the full range of illicit drugs.  However, I am aware that provisional Garda figures indicate that 136kgs of heroin, with an estimated street value of €27.2m, was seized in 2006.  This represents an approximate four-fold increase on the volume of seizures in 2005 when 32.28kgs of the drug were seized.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Gárdaí on their success in this regard, and on their significant on-going contribution to disrupting the sale of illegal drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2722">This success reflects a world-wide trend with respect to seizures in that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that global seizures accounted for 44% of cocaine production, 28% of cannabis resin, 25% of opium production in 2005.  However, we cannot be in any way complacent, especially given the reported significant increase in heroin production in Afghanistan this year and the consequent threat of increased supply that this entails.</p>
            <p eId="para_2723">The three key performance indicators for the supply reduction pillar of the National Drugs Strategy — as revised under the mid-term review of the Strategy published in 2005 — are to increase by 2008:</p>
            <p eId="para_2724">the volume of drugs seized by 50%, based on 2000 figures;</p>
            <p eId="para_2725">the number of seizures by 20%, based on 2004 figures; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2726">the number of supply detections by 20%, based on 2004 figures,</p>
            <p eId="para_2727">With respect to the volume of drugs seized across the three main categories of illicit drugs — heroin, cocaine and cannabis — Garda figures to the end of 2005 show increases of 35%, 1,174% and 1,548% respectively over the levels of seizures in 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2728">With respect to both the number of seizures and the number of supply detections, no data is yet available for 2006. However, in 2005, the overall number of seizures increased by 14% (from 5,299 to 6,046) while the number of supply detections increased by 21% (from 1,600 to 1,928) over the numbers recorded for 2004.  Clearly, most performance indicators with respect to supply reduction have been or are in the process of being met.</p>
            <p eId="para_2729">However, the nature of any relationship between the level of drugs seizures and the prevalence of drug usage is extremely difficult to determine.  Our most recent comprehensive data in this regard comes from the all island Drug Prevalence Survey 2002/2003.  Field-work for the second such survey is currently in progress and will be completed in April 2007, with first reports becoming available in the autumn.  While the most recent data on heroin use in Ireland comes from a study published in 2004, the Deputies should note that a similar study is to be commissioned in 2007.  When completed, these studies will give us a much clearer view of the prevalence and changing nature of drug misuse in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2730">At my request, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) and the National Drug Strategy Team (NDST) recently prepared a joint briefing paper on cocaine, based on existing data in Ireland.  The paper, which is due to be published next week, concluded that all data sources indicated an upward trend in cocaine use.  A number of recommendations are made in the paper, principally in regard to treatment, but also covering supply, prevention and research and these are being followed up with the relevant Departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2731">I believe that there are encouraging signs of progress over the past couple of years — be it in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion and success of treatment services, the development of prevention programmes in schools, the expanding work of Local and Regional Drug Task Forces and the valuable work being done through the Young Peoples Facility &amp; Services Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_2732">Finally, in regard to the resources available to tackle drug misuse, I am delighted to have secured a 16% increase in my Department's funding to tackle drug misuse in 2007, especially as it follows on from very significant increases in the previous two years.  The allocation of €50m shows an increase of 87% on the corresponding figure for 2004.  The significantly increased figure clearly illustrates, I believe, the importance that the Government places on tackling the drugs problem across the country.  Furthermore, the overall allocation by the Government across a number of Departments to tackle the drugs problem in 2007 will be well in excess of €200m.</p>

            <p eId="para_2737">Funding to assist suicide prevention initiatives was one of the priority funding measures approved by Government for support from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2006.  In this regard, details concerning the allocation of almost €1 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund to support twenty suicide prevention projects were announced on 23 October 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2738">The key objective of this funding measure is to provide interventions and supports to strengthen community based initiatives, particularly, although not exclusively, those targeting young men under 35 years of age.  The intention of the funding is to support locally based initiatives supporting suicide prevention.  The projects approved are varied and include the provision of early intervention measures for those at risk and also the provision of services for those bereaved through suicide.</p>
            <p eId="para_2739">The lead Department in relation to this funding measure and in relation to mainstream supports for suicide prevention is the Department of Health and Children.  The application and assessment process was administered by Pobal on behalf of the lead Department.  In total, 125 applications were received in response to a public invitation.  The group referred to in the Deputy's question were not among the applicant groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_2740">Government recently approved the 2007 Programme of measures to be supported through Dormant Accounts funding.  Suicide prevention initiatives are not among the specific themes which will be targeted this year although measures to tackle youth disadvantage will again feature strongly in this year's Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2745">The Deputy will appreciate that the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP) is a strategic document setting out a broad investment framework and investment priorities, together with indicative financial allocations, for the next seven years.  It does not contain a list of all projects to be undertaken in 2007, or indeed over the period of the NDP, although certain Chapters, including those on Regional Development, Economic Infrastructure and Social Infrastructure, refer to projects scheduled for delivery or progression between now and the end of 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_2753">Local and Community Development Programme</p>
            <p eId="para_2754">My Department will also have an important role in relation to the horizontal themes of Development of the Rural Economy and All-Island Co-operation identified in the NDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2755">The majority of the expenditure under the aforementioned programmes will consist of a mix of current and capital support for locally initiated projects, which are important but of a relatively small-scale in a national context.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">In terms of larger-scale projects, work is under way to explore the possibility of restoring the Ulster Canal to provide a major inland waterway for the border region. Under the Islands Sub-programme, resources will be concentrated on a flagship project, which is expected to commence in 2007, to implement major improvements to the piers and harbours of the three Aran Islands.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">There are currently no plans to fund any of the above programmes through other sources such as Public Private Partnership mechanisms or user charges. In the case of the Údarás na Gaeltachta sub-programme, details of own resources utilised by an tÚdarás are set out in Appendix 3 to the Revised Estimate Volume and in the annual Agency Statement for the body included in that Volume.</p>

            <p eId="para_2797">The research referred to by the Deputy is part of the Research Outcome Study in Ireland (ROSIE) which was commissioned by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD).  The Study aims to assess the effectiveness of treatment for drug users over a period of time and the overall message emerging is that current treatment of opiate users is having significantly positive effects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2798">The ROSIE study — the first national study of this type — follows participants from the point of treatment intake and monitors progress at intervals of 6 months, 1 year and 3 years.  Overall, the study found marked reductions in heroin and other drug use and decreased criminal activity among participants.  There was also an improvement in the physical and mental health of participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2799">In January 2007, the NACD published a summary of the ROSIE findings focusing on people 1 year after detoxification (Summary of 1 –Year Outcomes: Detoxification Modality).  The findings for this cohort demonstrated that participation in a detoxification programme leads to reduced drug use, reduced injecting, decreased involvement in crime, improved physical and mental health symptoms and increased contacts with social care services.  Also of interest was the fact that, when compared with other national and international research, the outcomes for ROSIE participants in detoxification treatment were good and programme completion rates were high.</p>
            <p eId="para_2800">One of the key objectives of the National Drugs Strategy is to encourage and enable those dependent on drugs to avail of treatment leading to reduced  dependency and improved overall health and social well-being.  In this regard, the results from the ROSIE study are evidence that the aims and objectives of the Strategy are sound and are achievable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2801">I accept that detoxification is a valuable rehabilitation tool for many problem drug users.  Arising from the Mid-term Review of the National Drugs Strategy, I arranged for the establishment of a Working Group on Rehabilitation, chaired by my Department, to draw up a comprehensive strategy for drugs rehabilitation.  That Working Group has completed its deliberations and its report will be published shortly.  Increased provision of detoxification facilities will feature among its recommendations.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2817">I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 126 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2818">I want to acknowledge, with regret, the tragic deaths late last year of a number of heroin users in Dublin.  They illustrate again the inherent dangers associated with drug misuse.  In order for the exact cause of these deaths to be ascertained, toxicology reports were initiated. However, I understand the results of these tests are not yet available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2819">Illegal drug use is a global issue and so our efforts to tackle it in Ireland must be seen in that context.  The enormity and the geographic scale of the struggle we face can best be illustrated by looking at the sources of the drugs that are sold on our streets.  Heroin comes mainly from the so-called Golden Crescent of Afghanistan and Pakistan, but also from Burma, Laos and Thailand.  Furthermore, as the Deputy points out, particularly good harvests in the countries of origin only serve to exacerbate the global situation. To really get to grips with the international problems of drug misuse, I believe that it is imperative that the drug issue be tackled in the countries of origin, as well as in all the countries through which the drugs travel before they reach our shores.</p>
            <p eId="para_2820">I acknowledge the level of major seizures of heroin in recent times and I congratulate the Gardaí on these successes.  The nature of any relationship between the level of drugs seizures and the prevalence of drug usage is extremely difficult to determine.  The perception is that heroin use has stabilised in Dublin and that it is at low levels nationwide, with some Leinster towns being mentioned as areas of potential risk.  However, our most up-to-date and comprehensive data comes from the all-island Drug Prevalence Survey 2002/2003.  Fieldwork for the second such Survey is currently in progress and will be completed in April, with first reports becoming available in the autumn.  With respect to heroin use in particular, the Capture/Recapture Study was published by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs in 2003 and a further such study is being commissioned this year.  These surveys will give us a much clearer view of the prevalence and changing nature of drug misuse in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2821">In regard to the resources available to tackle drug misuse, I am delighted to have secured a 16% increase in my Department's funding to tackle drug misuse in 2007, especially as it follows on from very significant increases in the previous two years.  The allocation of €50m shows an increase of 87% on the corresponding figure for 2004.  The significantly increased figure illustrates the importance that the Government places on tackling the drugs problem across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2822">In 2007, substantial progress is expected by the Regional Drugs Task Forces in implementing their action plans. Meanwhile, through the Emerging Needs Fund, the Local Drugs Task Forces will be able to address the most pressing issues arising in the evolving drugs situation in their areas.  In addition, the Minister for Health &amp; Children announced an increase of €6 million as part of Budget 2007 to address the health-related aspects of the National Drugs Strategy.  Overall, therefore, the allocation by the Government across a number of Departments to tackle the drugs problem in 2007 will be well in excess of €200m in total.</p>
            <p eId="para_2823">I believe that there are encouraging signs of progress over the past couple of years in tackling the problem of drug use in Ireland — be it in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion and success of treatment services, the development of prevention programmes in schools, the expanding work of Local and Regional Drug Task Forces and the valuable work being done through the Young People's Facility &amp; Services Fund.  Through the National Drugs Strategy, the Government is committed to continuing to tackle the problem into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2833">As the Deputy is probably aware, research is one of the five pillars of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.  The key objectives under this pillar are to have valid, timely and comparable data available on the extent of drug misuse amongst the population. In this context, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) was established in 2000 to advise Government in relation to prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of problem drug use in Ireland, based on its analysis of research findings and information available to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2834">In relation to prevalence of drug use, the NACD, in conjunction with the Drug and Alcohol Information and Research Unit in Northern Ireland, published a series of bulletins based on results from an all-island Drug Prevalence Survey 2002/2003.  This study found that almost one in five (19%) of respondents on the island of Ireland reported ever taking an illegal drug.  Cannabis was the most commonly used illegal drug.  Lifetime prevalence rates for cannabis were 17% in Ireland and current rates of use were 2.6%.  Aside from cannabis, the most common drugs ever used were ecstasy (5%), magic mushrooms, LSD and poppers (each 4%), amphetamines (3%), solvents, cocaine (each2%), heroin, (o.4%) and crack (0.3%).</p>
            <p eId="para_2835">The second all-island Drugs Prevalence Survey is currently in progress and it is expected that preliminary results will be available in the latter part of this year.  This will give much greater clarity on the overall current prevalence of drugs in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2836">In relation to heroin use, the 3-Source Capture-Recapture Study published in 2004 by the NACD, estimated the number of people using heroin at 14,452 in 2001.  When the Dublin figures were extracted from this study and compared with a previous study carried out in 1996 (which looked at Dublin only), the number of people using opiates in the capital was estimated to have declined by a approximately 1,000.   The second Capture-Recapture Study will get under way this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">In addition to these studies, the NACD's 2005-2008 work programme includes: the continuation of the Research Outcome Study in Ireland; a new study on drugs and crime; and work focusing on (i) prostitution and drugs and (ii) early school leavers and drugs.  The recent results of the Research Outcome Study in Ireland (ROSIE) are particularly encouraging and provide clear evidence that the current treatment of heroin users is having very positive results.</p>
            <p eId="para_2838">Illegal drug use is a global issue and our efforts to tackle it in Ireland must be seen in that context.  Through the National Drugs Strategy, the Government is committed to tackling the problem into the future and I can assure the Deputy that our actions in that regard will continue to be backed up by quality research producing relevant information in an evolving situation.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
         the level of funding which has been provided in County Cork through his Department’s community development programme since 2002; the groups which have delivered the programme locally on behalf of the Government in the county; and if it is planned that they will continue to be involved over the course of the National Development Plan 2007 to 2013.

            <p eId="para_2998">Since 1997, my Department and its predecessor, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, have provided some €8.7m for essential capital works on the islands off the County Donegal coast.  These works included pier and road improvements, water supply, waste management, car parking facilities and village renewal.  Assistance is also available for the provision of community and recreational facilities and activities on the islands. It is intended to continue with this programme of investment in the islands over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2999">My Department currently subsidises two ferry services in Co Donegal serving Toraigh and Árainn Mhór at a total cost of over €305,000 per annum.  A winter helicopter service arranged by Údarás na Gaeltachta is also funded by my Department for Toraigh. In addition, plans are currently being progressed for the provision of a subsidised cargo service for Toraigh.</p>
            <p eId="para_3000">I also launched a plan in 2006 aimed at marketing the islands, including those in Donegal, internationally as a niche product.  The total cost of this initiative, which is being funded jointly by my Department and Fáilte Ireland, is €343,000 over a three-year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3001">The Deputy should also be aware that the various schemes operated by Údarás na Gaeltachta promoting enterprise and community development are also available to Gaeltacht islands in Co Donegal and that an tÚdarás provides annual administration grants to the co-operatives on Toraigh and Árainn Mór, and to Ancaire, the co-op serving the smaller Donegal islands.</p>

Is é seo an chéad chóras dá leithéid a bheidh ar fáil d'aistritheoirí Gaeilge na tíre seo.  Reáchtáladh dhá scrúdú i 2006 agus de thoradh na scrúdaithe sin tá áthas orm a rá gur éirigh le 75 aistritheoir an caighdeán chuí a bhaint go dáta.   Tá sonraí iomlán an phainéil sin foilsithe ar shuíomh idirlín an Fhorais.  Tuigim go bhfuil i gceist dhá scrúdú eile a eagrú i mbliana  agus gach bliain eile as seo amach. Sa chaoi sin cuirfear le líon na n-aistritheoirí cáilithe.  Is cinnte gur cúnamh praiticiúil fíor-thábhachtach a bheidh sa phainéal seo do chomhlachtaí poiblí a úsáideann seirbhísí ó aistritheoirí príobháideacha, go háirithe i ndáil lena ndualgais faoin Acht a chomhlíonadh.</p>

Tá an scéim nua, atá á riaradh i gcomhar leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta agus an tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas, dírithe ar líon na gcéimithe le scileanna sonracha Gaeilge i réimsí ar leith a mhéadú, i gcomhthéacs Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla agus an Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga oifigiúil san Aontas Eorpach.</p>

            <p eId="para_3042">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue, until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_3043">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Castlebridge Garda Station on 26 February, 2007 was 1. Castlebridge Garda Station forms part of the Wexford District. The personnel strength of the Wexford District on 31 December, 1997 and 26 February, 2007 was 76 and 104 (all ranks) respectively. This represents an increase of 28 (or36.8%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3044">Castlebridge Garda Station is open to the public from 10am to 1pm daily, subject to manpower availability. The call diversion system is in operation and linked to the District Headquarters at Wexford Garda Station.</p>

            <p eId="para_3046">I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_3047">I have been advised by the Garda authorities that recorded crime in the area was relatively static between 2000 and 2004. However, local Garda management has noted an increase in the number of domestic burglaries and thefts from farm holdings/building sites in rural areas of the sub-district in the past two years. As a result, Superintendent Wexford met with members of the Castlebridge Community Council in October 2006 to discuss crime and traffic issues. Local Garda management constantly monitors crime and personnel levels to ensure every option is examined in order to provide a higher Garda presence in the sub district of Castlebridge by augmenting resources whenever possible. The local community has been assured of the support and commitment of An Garda Síochána to provide a high visibility presence in the sub-district.</p>
            <p eId="para_3048">Current policing plans in the area are predicated on the prevention of  crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property and public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the Castlebridge area.</p>

A Chief Executive designate has also been appointed and is engaged in preparatory work for establishment of the Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3078">As regards difficulties arising in relation to the operation of property management companies, the Law Reform Commission's Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments makes it clear that action will be required across a broad range of policy areas, including the planning and development code, company law, consumer protection law and the development of regulatory structures. In recognition of this, and the cross-cutting nature of many of the issues, the Government has approved the establishment of a high-level interdepartmental committee to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive legislative response to the difficulties arising in relation to property management companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3079">A key task of the committee, which will hold its first meeting next week, will be to identify the key legislative and administrative actions to be taken and to determine a timescale for implementation as soon as possible. In particular, the committee will have regard to recommendations for legislative reforms contained in the Law Reform Commission's Report on Multi-Unit Developments which will be published later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">I should also mention that the National Consumer Agency has produced a very valuable booklet entitled ‘Putting Consumers First' which contains information and guidance for those who have bought an apartment or house in a multi-unit complex, or are considering doing so.

            <p eId="para_3081">Pending the enactment of future legislation, I believe that improved awareness of their rights, and a better understanding of the corresponding duties and responsibilities of developers and builders, will enable the owners of apartments and houses in multi-unit complexes to assert their rights as company members, become involved in the management of their company and combat abuses.</p>

Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>

            <p eId="para_3126">I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is aware of the problem local residents have with anti-social behaviour and public disorder in the area concerned,  particularly in relation to groups of youths from the locality congregating around the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3127">I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to is regularly patrolled by uniform and plain clothes Gardaí from its local Garda station with a view to ensuring a concentrated and visible Garda presence in the area. These patrols are backed up by  Divisional Garda Units, including the Traffic Corps, Mountain Bike, Drug, Task Force and the District and Divisional Detective Units.</p>
            <p eId="para_3128">I understand that there has been one incident, of graffiti, recorded in the area referred to. This incident is under investigation by the Garda authorities and arrangements have been made with the local authority to have the graffiti removed. However, no one has been made amenable for this incident to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3129">Community policing is a central value of policing policy and there are two Gardaí from the local Community Policing Unit assigned to the area. They liase with local residents and residents' group and give assistance and crime prevention advice. Any complaints of anti-social behaviour and vandalism are fully investigated when reported to the Garda authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3130">Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_3142">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of the Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.

Garda management further state that the information on total numbers of transfers to and from the Stations referred to in the question over the past five years is not readily available in the detail sought and can only be obtained by the disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources.

            <p eId="para_3148">I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 171 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3149">The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the years 2002 to 2005 is available in the relevant Garda Annual Reports, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have asked the CSO to provide the information sought by the Deputy, in relation to 2006, directly to him.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_3151">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the proposed transfer by a landowner, in the circumstances outlined, is treated as a disposal for capital gains tax purposes.  In computing the gain the deemed sale price is the market value of the property at the date of the transfer.  Relief from capital gains tax is available where an individual, aged 55 years or over, disposes of all or part of his/her "qualifying assets".  For the purposes of this relief "qualifying assets" include assets which have been owned by the individual for a period of not less than 10 years ending on the date of the disposal and have been used for the purposes of farming or a trade by the individual throughout the 10-year period ending with the disposal.  If the transfer is from parent to child, relief is withdrawn if the child disposes of the assets within 6 years of the date of transfer.  The withdrawn relief is chargeable on the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_3152">For the purpose of both Gift and Inheritance Tax (Capital Acquisitions Tax), the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold- known as the "Group Threshold".  The threshold applying to a gift or inheritance received by a child from his/her parents is the Group A threshold and for 2007 this is €496,824.  Any other gifts/inheritances that might have been received by the beneficiary from within the same Group A threshold (i.e. from parents) since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account when applying the threshold for the purpose of calculating the gift/inheritance tax.  Each child is separately entitled to its own Group A tax-free threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_3153">If a gift or inheritance consists of agricultural lands, the market value of the agricultural lands may be reduced by 90% provided certain conditions are met. The conditions attaching to the relief are that the land is taken by a "farmer", who is defined in the legislation as an individual in respect of whom not less that 80 per cent of his or her assets, after taking the gift or inheritance, consist of agricultural property and also that the land is not disposed of for six years after the date of the receipt of the gift or inheritance.  A gift of land attracts a stamp duty liability based on the market value of the land transferred.  The rates of stamp duty which apply are set out in the Table that follows this reply.  The stamp duty payable is reduced by 50% in the case of a gift from a parent to a child.  There is an exemption from stamp duty in the case of the transfer of land to a person who is under 35 years of age, who is the holder of specified educational qualifications and who complies with certain other conditions.  However, having regard to the details supplied by the Deputy, this exemption would not apply to the transfer in this case.</p>

It is, therefore, not possible to identify what portion of the net VAT received relates to sales of electricity, gas or telecommunications to domestic households.  However, based on statistical data derived from non-Revenue sources, the expected revenue accruing from VAT on gas, electricity and telecommunications at the end of 2006 is as follows:</p>

            </table>
            <p eId="para_3184">These figures would include VAT from unregistered and exempt businesses as well as domestic consumers.  It should also be noted that the VAT content of purchases of gas, electricity and telecommunications is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3185">The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Supplies of electricity and gas are already subject to the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% and telecommunications services are subject to the standard rate of VAT of 21%.  Under the VAT Directive Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services, which have been in place since 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services.  It is therefore not possible under EU law to apply a zero VAT rate to the provision of domestic utilities including electricity, gas and telecommunications.  In the case of supplies of electricity and gas, under EU law, it would not be possible to reduce the rate applying to such products below 12%.  Such a change in the reduced VAT rate, while having a significant Exchequer cost, would have little or no effect on the retail price of such products.  In the case of telecommunications services, it would not be possible to reduce the VAT rate without reducing the rate applying to all goods and services to which the standard rate applies.  This would have significant implications for the Exchequer.  A reduction of 1%  in the standard VAT rate would cost the Exchequer €415 million.</p>

The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  A person must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3194">(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3195">(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3199">(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3200">The scheme has been in operation in some form since 1968.  As regards changes to the medical/disability criteria: only criterion (a) was in place up to 1989, when they were expanded by the addition of (b), (c), (d) and (f); and in 1994, the final criterion at (e) was added.  A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3201">The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.  In respect of the long-term recommendations, including those relating to the qualifying disability criteria, further changes can only be made after careful consideration, given the scale and scope of the scheme.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.  This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</p>

It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model.

            <p eId="para_3228">The total allocation to the new Service is €33m; this is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the Programmes.  This includes additional funding of €5m for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the Cervical Screening Programme.  Significant preparatory work is well under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3238">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.  The introduction of the NCIP in January 2006, prior to the closure of the EOCP, has facilitated applicants unable to meet the end of EOCP deadlines for grant assistance by providing an alternative source of grant aid for child care provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3239">With an allocation of €575 million for the 5 year period of 2006-2010, the NCIP is a key element of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010.  The NCIP aims to deliver a more comprehensive approach to early years care and education and to deliver 50,000 additional child care places, with a greater focus on pre-school places for 3-4 year olds and school age child care.</p>
            <p eId="para_3240">Support towards the staffing costs of employing child care workers, in community based child care facilities in disadvantaged areas, was provided under the EOCP and have been extended to 31 December 2007 for all groups who are meeting the terms of their existing staffing grant contracts.  A new programme of staffing grants under the NCIP is expected to be announced later this year and will be informed by the outcome of a Value for Money Review of the EOCP which is currently in progress.  The Review is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3241">With regard to the Group in question, I understand that they were recently informed by the Childcare Directorate of my Office that their application for staffing grant assistance under the EOCP was being refused, as the application could not meet the end 2006 timeframe for entering into contract under the EOCP.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this position has been reviewed in the case of EOCP staffing grant applicants who have already entered into contract in respect of a linked EOCP capital grant, and who are due to open new child care facilities in advance of the introduction of the proposed new programme of staffing grants under the NCIP.  As a result, subject to the availability of EOCP funding for this purpose, applications for EOCP staffing grant assistance will continue to be considered in the circumstances outlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_3242">I have asked officials in the Childcare Directorate of my Office to contact the Group in question, along with a number of other Groups in similar circumstances, at the earliest opportunity to advise them of the position in regard to their grant application.</p>

            <p eId="para_3244">In January of this year I, along with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, announced the provision of funding to establish a new degree programme and associated clinic for the education of podiatrists (chiropodists) in Ireland.  The FÁS ‘Healthcare Skills Monitoring Report' August 2005 identified podiatry as an occupation with long term supply shortfalls and recommended the establishment of a BSc in Podiatry.  The provision of a school is a particular priority with the increased need for services due to the aging population and the significant increase in diabetes.  The availability of podiatry services has been shown internationally to improve or maintain the mobility of older persons and reduce the requirement for more extensive health services.  Both my Department and the Department of Education and Science along with the Health Service Executive and the Higher Education Authority (HEA) are working to establish a school of podiatry which will provide a 4 year degree program leading to a BSc in podiatry.  An annual intake of 25 students is planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3245">The HEA, working in partnership with a health care provider, has issued a call for proposals to higher education institutes for the establishment of a school and are currently awaiting responses.  It will then be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of any responses before a decision in relation to the school, including its location, can be reached.</p>

            <p eId="para_3250">My Department maintains a watching scientific brief on the most up-to-date research in relation to potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those emitted by mobile telephones and the associated base stations.  Government policy in this area is guided by the advice from international expert bodies, such as the World Health Organisation and the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). These bodies continually examine the totality of the scientific and medical evidence available so we have the most up-to-date and accurate information in regard to the potential health effects, if any, of electromagnetic fields.</p>
            <p eId="para_3251">The international consensus of scientific research to date is that there is no consistent evidence for adverse health effects below international guidelines, at the level of exposure from mobile phones and base stations. These guidelines have been developed by ICNIRP and are endorsed by the European Union under Council Recommendation EC/519/1999.  Indeed, the World Health Organisation states that: "Considering the very low exposure levels and research results collected to date, there is no convincing scientific evidence that the weak RF signals from base stations and wireless networks cause adverse health effects". The Inter-departmental Committee on the Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields have received the report of the Expert Group and formulated proposals to Government. I will shortly bring these proposals to my Cabinet colleagues.</p>

            <p eId="para_3257">The Council of the European Union is currently examining its procedures for listing persons and entities, suspected of being involved in terrorism, for asset freezing purposes in order to take account of the judgment of the Court of First Instance delivered on 12 December 2006. Ireland is active in these discussions and is working with EU partners to improve the EU's listing procedures to ensure that they are in line with the judgment of the Court by ensuring that such individuals and entities are provided with reasons for their listing and an opportunity to make their case for non-inclusion on the list.</p>
            <p eId="para_3258">On 28 September 2001, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1373 (2001) on combating terrorism. The resolution obliges States to freeze funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons and entities who commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts. It was implemented in the EU through Common Positions 2001/930/CFSP and 2001/931/CFSP, which list such individuals and entities, and Council Regulation (EC) 2580/2001 which orders the freezing of the funds and assets of those on the list. The list is regularly updated by Council decisions and PMOI (People's Mujahidin of Iran) was included in May 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_3259">PMOI brought an action before the Court of First Instance seeking annulment of those Common Positions and Decisions relevant to its listing. The Court issued its judgment on 12 December 2006 and annulled the relevant Council Decision, insofar as it included PMOI on the list, on the grounds that the Council had not given PMOI an opportunity to make its views known, had not provided PMOI with a sufficient statement of reasons for its inclusion in the list, and was therefore in breach of certain fundamental rights guaranteed by the Community's legal order including the right to a fair hearing. The Court did not examine whether PMOI was involved in terrorist acts or whether its inclusion on the EU's asset freeze list was therefore justified. In addition, the Court did not annul the relevant Common Position on listing which was in operation at the time PMOI took its action, as the latter had sought. Neither did it annul the subsequent Decision that maintained PMOI on the list. The claim by PMOI for damages was also dismissed as inadmissible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3260">In compliance with the judgment of the Court, the Council informed PMOI on 30 January 2007 that it intended to maintain PMOI on the asset freeze list, and it provided PMOI with a statement of reasons for its inclusion in this list. The Council also invited PMOI to present its observations on this statement of reasons within one month, together with any supporting documentation. The Council will carefully examine any observations submitted by PMOI within this period, before making a decision on whether to include it on the asset freeze list.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3323">On 12 April 2006 the EU Commission initiated an investigation into a complaint of dumping of imports of polyester staple fibres (PSF) from Malaysia and Taiwan. The Commission's initial investigation has concluded that dumping of PSF by the countries concerned has taken place and that the imposition of provisional anti-dumping measures is justified. Accordingly the Commission has imposed provisional anti-dumping measures under Commission Regulation No. 2005/2006 of 22 December 2006 for a period of 6 months. The Commission investigation is continuing and is expected to reach definitive conclusions in the next few months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3324">In general, Ireland's policy is to support the adoption of protective measures where dumping has caused injury to Community industry, and where it is considered to be in the overall Community interest having regard to the views of  producers and users. In this case I am aware that there are domestic producer and user interests in the measures and it is open to interested parties to make submissions to the Commission before it reaches a definitive conclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3325">Before the Community position is finalised the Member States will be given an opportunity to make their views known in this case. In considering the best approach to be adopted by Ireland I will take fully into account any submissions received from the producer and user industry here.</p>

            <p eId="para_3327">Council Directive 96/82/EC — the Seveso II directive as amended by Directive 2003/105/EC — was transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 74 of 2006).  The Seveso Directives require that preventing major accidents and limiting the consequences of such accidents be taken into account by the Member States in their land use policies and or other relevant policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3328">The Directives require that, in the interest of safety, these policies must take account of the need, in the long term, to maintain appropriate distances between establishments covered by the directive and residential areas, areas of public use and areas of particular natural sensitivity or interest.  The Directives further require that the procedures set up to implement these policies must be designed to ensure technical advice on the risks arising from the establishment is available, on a case by case or on a generic basis, when decisions on land use planning are taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_3329">Under these Regulations, the Health and Safety Authority has a role in providing technical advice to the planning authorities in the context of land use planning.    The decisions on land use planning, however, are a matter for the planning authorities, including in relation to the siting and any subsequent granting of permission for additional development of plants which fall under the terms of the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 74 of 2006).    Issues concerning the Planning and Development Act 2000, which governs land use planning, are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_3331">Generally, employment legislation provides that, where the relevant body makes an award by way of a decision or determination in favour of the employee, the employer is allowed six weeks to implement the award.   During the six week period either party concerned may appeal on a point of law to the Circuit or High Court, as appropriate.  If, on the expiry of that period, the employer has failed to implement the award the District or Circuit Court, as appropriate, may, on application by the employee concerned, the employee's trade union with the consent of the employee or the Minister, if the Minister considers it appropriate to make the application having regarding to all the circumstances, make an order directing the employer to carry out the determination in accordance with its terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_3332">Some 119 cases involving the failure of an employer to implement an award of the Labour Court or the Employment Appeals Tribunal were, in 2006, referred to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment by an employee or trade union with a view to an application being made for an order directing the employer to carry out the determination.  In cases where the Chief State Solicitors Office so advises, legal proceedings may be instituted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3333">Details of any applications made directly to the District or Circuit Court by employees or trade unions and of awards not followed up by employees on the expiry of the six week period are not available to the Department.  The Prosecution and Enforcement Unit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment deals with the enforcement of determinations coming from the Labour Court and Employment Appeals Tribunal where the employer has failed to carry out the terms of the determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">If the person referred to by the Deputy contacts the Enforcement Unit at Telephone Nos. 01-6313314 or 6313017, they will be advised of the steps necessary for the institution of legal proceedings to enforce the award.</p>

This Sunday premium consists of:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3337">(a) a payment to the employee of an allowance of such amount as is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances, or</p>

If the value of a Sunday premium is not specified in a collective agreement applying to the employee who has taken the case to the Rights Commissioner, the Rights Commissioner can have regard, in determining the case, to the value of any premium for Sunday work provided for in a collective agreement which applies to an employee who is employed to do, under similar circumstances, identical or similar work in the same industry or sector as the employee who has made the claim to the Rights Commissioner.</p>

            <p eId="para_3351">The primary purpose of CE is to provide short-term work experience and training opportunities for long-term unemployed persons and other disadvantaged groups with a view to facilitating their progression to work in the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3352">As part of the restructuring of CE approved in 1999, future participation in CE by an individual was capped at 3 years, effective from April, 2000.   This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training/education options where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals. The three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. In general, approximately 20% of participants including persons less than 55 years of age may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_3353">In November 2004, it was decided that the 3-year cap would be extended for CE participants aged over 55.  This category of participants is now eligible to participate on CE for a maximum of 6 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3354">In July 2006 my Department published its Sectorial Plan under the Disability Act, 2005.   One of the key highlights of this Plan is to increase participation rates of people with disabilities on CE over the period of the Plan and to raise the CE participation limits for people with disabilities, in order to provide additional training to assist progression to employment:</p>
            <p eId="para_3355">For people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit has been raised by one year from 3 to 4 years;</p>
            <p eId="para_3356">For people with disabilities over 55 years of age, the participation limit has also been raised by one year from 6 to 7 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3357">While I have not introduced any policy changes relating to Community Employment in 2007, I am informed by FÁS that the participation limits will continue to be operated flexibly at local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_3380">Implementation of a single travel pass for all-Ireland free travel, acceptable in both jurisdictions, will require the completion of the Integrated Ticketing project being developed under the auspices of the Department of Transport and subsequent integration with the ticketing systems in operation in Northern Ireland.

            <p eId="para_3381">Pending development of the integrated ticket system, my Department has engaged with the Department of Regional Development and Translink, the main transport authority in Northern Ireland, to put in place an interim scheme to permit senior residents of both jurisdictions to avail of free travel within the other jurisdiction.</p>

This will be a once off transaction for customers availing of this scheme, but the level of applications will be kept under review to determine if there is a need at some future point to alter the policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3384">The office for Social Inclusion (OSI) was set up in 2002 under the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) as part of the institutional structure of the NAPS and to be responsible for the implementation of the strategy and monitoring of progress and for research and data development.  The Office is within my Department and has been involved in the development and co-ordination of the recent National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion) and in the preparation of the social inclusion elements of Towards 2016 and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP).  The total cost of running the Office for Social Inclusion amounted to €633,192 in 2006 and the estimated cost for 2007 is €883,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3385">The strategic framework embodied in the new NAPinclusion will facilitate greater co-ordination and integration of structures and procedures across Government at national and local levels to achieve more effective implementation.  Arrangements are also in place for a more comprehensive monitoring process that encompasses Towards 2016 and the NDP.   A key element of this process will be the preparation by the OSI of an annual Social Inclusion Report, which will review progress against targets on an annual basis, identify any new issues arising which might benefit from a more co-ordinated approach and report on stakeholders' views emerging from various fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_3386">The OSI will also be involved in the preparation of regular national reports to the EU to ensure exchange between Member States of knowledge, experience, expertise and good practice on social protection and social inclusion. OSI will also participate in mechanisms to foster North-South co-operation on social inclusion issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_3387">In addition to its co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation roles, the OSI is responsible for the development of support functions to underpin the social inclusion process.  These include the development of a data strategy to ensure that progress against targets can be effectively monitored; research on the nature and causes of poverty and social exclusion in today's society and on the effectiveness of the policies and programmes designed to meet these challenges; and the development and implementation across central and local government of Poverty Impact Assessment guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_3388">The role of the OSI is kept under review in the context of the development of strategy on poverty and social inclusion in order to ensure that the arrangements for putting forward the social inclusion agenda generally continue to be effective and efficient.</p>

            <p eId="para_3396">I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 219 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3397">The Department of Transport has recently funded a scheme to convert 50 selected vehicles to run on pure plant oil, PPO, which is being carried out under the aegis of the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce. The cost to the Department is €227,000 and provides for 75% of the cost of engine modification.</p>
            <p eId="para_3398">Decisions about successful applications are being made in April with the view to obtaining a diverse mix of transport operators and the project will conclude in November. It is expected that this scheme will be complementary to the Minerals Oil Tax Relief, MOTR, Scheme II and will help develop a sustainable indigenous network of localized PPO supply chains in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3399">Bus Éireann have been using bio-diesel made from recovered vegetable oil, RVO, in its Cork City tours fleet since April 2006 while Dublin Bus have used 5% bio-diesel blend on a trial basis in 5 open-top tour buses since May 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3400">These trials have proceeded without technical difficulties and I have instructed public transport providers, under the auspices of CIE, to operate their entire existing fleet on a 5% bio-diesel blend in as short a time-frame as is possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3401">In addition, Dublin Bus have secured a commitment from the relevant engine manufacturer, Volvo, that would allow new buses to be modified to operate on a 30% biofuel mix without affecting the warranty. Therefore, I have requested the Chairman of CIE to set out the steps required to move toward these targets and I expect an action plan from the company, which will include estimated costs for this initiative. It is my intention that all new vehicles procured, as part of fleet replacement by CIE from 2008, will be capable of operating on a 30% bio-diesel blend.</p>

            <p eId="para_3406">The manner is which text is displayed on traffic signs by road authorities, and the format used in the case of Irish text, English text or text in any other language is determined by the Minister for Transport under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.</p>
            <p eId="para_3407">The Traffic Signs Manual sets out the principles laid down for road authorities in relation to the manner in which Irish and English text must be displayed on traffic signs. The Manual sets out the standard form of all non-regulatory traffic signs. In the case of regulatory traffic signs, the text to be displayed is prescribed in the Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations 1997-2006 and in the associated Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997-2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3408">Road authorities and the National Roads Authority can only provide traffic signs on the public roads that comply with the road traffic regulatory provisions and the directions given in the Manual.</p>
            <p eId="para_3409">The same Transport Heavy font is used for Irish and English text on traffic signs. It is important that road users be aware that two distinct languages are displayed on traffic signs and be able to distinguish between the two texts and read the message from the text that is relevant to them. Irish text is displayed above any other text on a sign, is inclined to the right at an angle of 15 degrees to the vertical with the first letter of each word having a capital letter and the remaining letters in lower case. On a bilingual sign the translation of that text into English is displayed in uppercase Roman numerals underneath the Irish text.</p>
            <p eId="para_3410">I am satisfied with the present provisions in relation to the display of text on traffic signs and I have no proposals to amend the relevant statutory provisions.</p>

Ahead of the launch of the 2006 Scheme, my Department had conducted consultations with voluntary and community based organisations, as a result of which I made several important changes to the Scheme provisions. For the formal Scheme launch in May last, I hosted a reception involving representatives of a wide range of voluntary organisations to mark ten years of the Scheme and to publicise the Scheme generally and the new Scheme provisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3440">I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 to 229, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3441">The majority of current expenditure allocated to community groups through my Department for drugs initiatives is channeled through the Local Drugs Task Forces (including the Emerging Needs Fund), the Regional Drugs Task Forces and the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_3442">The combined current expenditure on these in 2006 was €31.80m and I happy to advise the Deputy that the expected expenditure of €39.15m in 2007  represents an increase of 23%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3443">Of the 14 Local Drugs Task Forces, 12 are based in Dublin and one in Bray.</p>
            <p eId="para_3444">Expenditure in 2006 in these 13 areas under the Local Drugs Task Force  process, the Emerging Needs Fund and the Young People's Facilities &amp; Services Fund came to  €24.61m.  The comparable provision for 2007 is €27.84m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3445">Of the 10 Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs), four cover the greater Dublin area and the adjoining counties — East Coast RDTF (Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Wicklow), Northern Area RDTF (North Dublin City and Fingal), South West RDTF (South Dublin, Kildare and West Wicklow) and the North Eastern RDTF (Meath, East Cavan, Louth and Monaghan). Specific allocations are not made on a county basis, rather each RDTF produced a strategic plan for the region involved.  In 2006 a total of €1.71m was spent in these four RDTFs on implementing actions identified in those plans.  It is expected that this figure will be doubled in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3446">Local and Regional Drug Task Force projects normally originate at Task Force level and are submitted to the National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST).  Following consideration by the NDST, recommendations for funding of some projects are made to my Department.  Under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF), projects normally originate from Development Groups in the various Task Force areas and are submitted to the National Assessment Committee of the YPFSF chaired by my Department.  In the event of projects not being selected for submission, communities are at liberty to pursue the matter with the relevant Drugs Task Force or Development Group.</p>

            <p eId="para_3469">I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 and 232 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3470">The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated RAPID areas.  In addition, RAPID priority status was extended to Ballyfermot in 2006. My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3471">As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.  The provision in my Department's Vote funds two elements of the Programme.  The first relates to the costs of the administration of the Programme; the second element relates to the RAPID Leverage Fund schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3472">I initiated the Leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti clean-up, traffic calming, CCTV, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds. Since the introduction of these schemes I have increased the amount of funds allocated from some €6.5m in 2004 to some €11.0m in 2006.  I am satisfied that the capital allocation of €7.8 million in 2007 is sufficient to meet the funding commitments I have approved for these schemes including the balance of funds allocated in 2006.  Actual spend in each year since 2004 on leverage of small scale projects was 2004 €1.98m, 2005 €4.51m and 2006 €4.54m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3473">In terms of expansion of the scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the joint initiative announced in January 2007 with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science that will enable €18m worth of investment in schools in RAPID areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_3475">The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) addresses many of my concerns on issues such as rural housing. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall Government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew established rural communities while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies. In this way it seeks to ensure key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and that rural settlement policies are responsive to the local circumstances of different areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3476">The guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing published by my colleague, Dick Roche T.D., Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, provide a more detailed framework for planners, based on the approach set out in the NSS regarding rural housing policy. The guidelines reflect my own view that rural housing within the confines of good planning practice is needed. These guidelines are important in ensuring clarity and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy on rural housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_3478">Dormant Accounts legislation provides for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in dormant accounts into the Dormant Accounts Fund.  Since the establishment of the Fund in May 2003, a total of €373.2 million has been transferred, of which €112.6 million has been reclaimed.  At this juncture, it is difficult to estimate what the inflows to the Fund will be in 2007 and subsequent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_3591">The latest Rural Development Regulation, No. 1698/2005 came into force on 1st January 2007.  The Rural Development Programme (RDP) for 2007 to 2013 was submitted to the European Commission for approval in December 2006, following extensive public consultation.  It includes a range of support measures for the agricultural and forestry sectors, some of which are co-financed with community aid while others are exclusively nationally funded.  The grant aid programme for forestry is now higher than ever before with grant-aid available for the first afforestation of agricultural land, the construction of forest roads and under a new Forest Environment Protection Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3600">My Department is committed to ensuring the maximum level of integration of inspections across all areas including inspections under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  On this basis, the overall number of annual inspections under the single payment scheme and disadvantaged areas scheme is unlikely to exceed 8,000.  This is a significant reduction from the 18,000 inspections annually under the old coupled regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_3601">My Department is carrying out a full review of the inspection arrangements for the single payment scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme before finalising the report forms and checklists for 2007.  The review will also involve consultation with the farm bodies and this process will commence as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3602">My Department is in regular contact with the European Commission with a view to simplification of single payment scheme requirements with particular reference to advance notice of inspections and tolerances.  The initiative by the Commission on simplification of the CAP and the review of cross-compliance, which is under way, provides the opportunity for a fresh look at cross-compliance and other single payment scheme issues.  I am certainly pressing for this both in direct contact with Commissioner Fischer Boel and the President of the Council, Minister Seehofer.  I raised the matter at the Council recently where several member states had similar problems to ours.  It is not surprising then that simplification of the CAP and the cross-compliance regime in particular are core issues for the current German Presidency of the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_3604">The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is the responsibility of the school management authorities.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3605">Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, it is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>

            <p eId="para_3610">A special PE funding package, of €6.5 million, issued late last year to primary schools.  Under the package, each school received €2,000 towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment in their school.  This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.  The modern equipment that can be purchased will facilitate PE and sporting activities in schools, which everyone recognises is a very important aspect of school life.</p>
            <p eId="para_3611">This funding package was made as part of this Government's continued commitment to modernise facilities in schools throughout the country.  In addition, since 2000, my Department has provided in excess of €5.5 million in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3612">Appropriate classroom equipment is provided as part of extension and refurbishment projects and new school buildings funded by my Department.

            <p eId="para_3613">I increased the level of grant payable under the annual devolved grant scheme for minor works to national schools last November.  All primary schools with full recognition receive a basic grant of €5,500 plus €18.50 per mainstream pupil and €74 per special needs pupil.  This grant is intended to address works required to the physical infrastructure of the schools or to pay for items of furniture and equipment for educational use, including PE and IT related equipment.  Some €27 million was paid out to primary schools throughout the country to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3614">Primary schools that establish a class for special needs pupils receive a once-off grant of €6,500 per class to purchase equipment, including physical education equipment, that they feel best meets the needs of the pupils attending the class.  Schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula, including physical education.  Since 1997, the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level was increased from €57.14 per pupil to €163.58 from 1 January 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_3616">I assume the Deputy is referring to the Primary School Sports Initiative, (PSSI), which was launched in January 2001.  It was established as a precursor  to the roll out of national in-service training for primary teachers in the Physical Education Curriculum. As part of this initiative, a task force was established to inform the development of the project.  Three teachers were seconded to the initiative, and were appointed as National Co-ordinator and assistant national co-ordinators.  These teachers worked closely with 27 schools during the lifetime of the initiative and developed lesson plans based on the PE Curriculum which have since been developed into a CD ROM, launched by me in May 2006 and circulated to every school in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3617">The work of the PSSI served to inform the content and structure of the seminars provided by the Primary Curriculum Support Programme, (PCSP), for all primary teachers.  Following the commencement of the training of designated PE trainers within the PCSP, the budget for the PSSI was subsumed into this programme.  Following interviews, the 3 teachers seconded to PSSI were offered positions as PE trainers with PCSP.   The national co-ordinator of the initiative however, had been appointed as principal before taking up this offer but the two assistant national co-ordinators accepted the offer and worked as trainers with the PCSP between 2004 and 2006. They have since returned to their base schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3618">Currently, there is an Assistant National Co-ordinator working with the PCSP who has responsibility for leading a team of 17 Physical Education/Social Personal and Health Education Cuiditheoir who are involved in supporting teachers in schools in the promotion of physical activity and healthy lifestyles.  This Co-ordinator also takes responsibility for co-ordinating the Active Schools Awards, another Department of Education and Science initiative which aims to raise the profile of PE and co-curricular physical activity in the context of the Primary PE curriculum and to promote lifelong involvement in sport and physical activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_3622">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network.  In this regard my Department has established 181 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools, 5 special classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome,16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum and 14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis.  Two of these facilities have yet to be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_3623">The Deputy may be aware that a building project to provide new accommodation at the school is nearing completion and I understand that it will be ready for occupation in the coming months.  I understand that there is provision for an autism unit within the new accommodation.  My officials wrote to the school principal on 16 February 2007 indicating the range of supports available to schools from my Department to support autism units.  These include a special class for autism typically established with an initial staff of one teacher and two special needs assistants (SNAs) for every six pupils and additional SNA support may be provided on the basis of the assessed needs of individual pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_3624">As a further support, many smaller schools where autism units are approved by the National Council for Special Education can now have an administrative principal to assist with the establishment and running of specialist intervention locally.  In addition, enhanced levels of capitation are available to special schools and mainstream schools with special classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3625">Additional training supports for staff engaged in the education provision for children with autism can be accessed through the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The service will, as appropriate, consolidate, co-ordinate, develop and deliver a range of professional development initiatives and support structures to the relevant staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_3626">Other supports include assistive technology grants where this is recommended and specialist equipment such as modified desks and chairs as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3627">As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is now operational.  A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is to identify appropriate educational placement for all children with special educational needs.  The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and schools. It is open to a parent to contact the SENO directly regarding their child's needs.  Contact details for the SENO may be accessed on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3628">The provision of therapeutic and clinical support for the autism unit is a matter for the Health Services Executive (HSE) and funding is provided to the HSE for such purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_3639">The Adult and Further Education services are funded by my Department and delivered locally by the Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  Any grant assistance from my Department to community or voluntary groups for English language classes must be channelled through VECs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3640">The White Paper on Adult Education "Learning for Life" (2000) stated that asylum seekers would be entitled to free access to Adult Literacy, English language and mother culture supports and refugees are entitled to the same access to education and training as Irish nationals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3641">My Department gives an annual grant to all VECs for the provision of Adult Literacy and Community Education. This fund may be used for the teaching of English to immigrants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3642">The cost of the literacy service delivered by VECs, which was funded by my Department, was over €23 million in 2006. The number of students was over 35,000. 27% of these, amounting to 10,000 clients, attended English for Speakers as Other Language (ESOL) courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_3643">The language needs of migrants formed part of the negotiations between social partners in drawing up the new social partnership agreement "Towards 2016".  A prioritised action included in the agreement is that the annual student cohort availing of the general national literacy service delivered by the Vocational Education Committees will be significantly increased by the provision of an extra 7,000 places by 2009, 3,000 of which will be provided this year.  Under the terms of the agreement, there will be a particular focus on the increasing number of migrants receiving an English language service (ESOL).</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_620">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3645">The commitment referred to by the Deputy relates to pupils under nine years of age. Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2006/07) is currently being worked on. Details on class size in primary schools will be available for Counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3646">Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 4,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_3647">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3648">Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3649">As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_3650">School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_3651">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</p>
            <p eId="para_3652">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</p>
            <p eId="para_3653">But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3654">I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_3656">The Government is determined to ensure that SSIA savers are treated fairly in the calculation of reckonable income under my Department's maintenance grant schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3657">This is being achieved in two ways: Firstly, income from SSIAs is being treated exactly the same as income from similar savings and investment products; and Secondly, the reckonable income limits for student grants have been increased considerably in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3658">Since SSIAs were introduced, the amount of income to be included in respect of them is the government grant earned on the savings in the relevant tax year plus, in the case of savings accounts, the gross interest earned in the relevant tax year, and, in the case of investment accounts, the investment profit earned in the relevant tax year. Investment losses sustained in the relevant tax year are deductible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3659">The same position has long applied to interest earned on other savings products, including deposit accounts, post office savings certificates, life assurance bonds etc. The treatment of SSIAs is therefore consistent with the traditional treatment of other similar investments over many years. The Department of Finance is aware of this approach to the assessment of income for eligibility for student support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3660">So, in applying for a grant for the 2007/08 academic year, only the relevant income earned, as outlined above, on the SSIA in 2005 has to be declared. The maximum that the Government grant to any SSIA saver could have amounted to last year, as in any year of the SSIA scheme, is €762.</p>
            <p eId="para_3661">This has been the position since SSIAs were introduced.</p>

            <p eId="para_3663">I announced in June 2006 that the Vocational Education Committees (VECs) would be given sole responsibility for the administration of the third level student maintenance grants and that this was part of my overall plans to introduce service improvements in the administration of the student grant schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3664">The arrangements for the future administration will be provided for in new statutory framework through a Student Support Bill.  The Government has approved the drafting of a new Student Support Bill which will place all student support schemes on a statutory footing for the first time, including providing for the designation of an appropriate awarding authority and for the general basis on which grants will be awarded to eligible students.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_3668">Red safety areas were first adopted at Casement Aerodrome following a review in 1992 by Aer Rianta, on behalf of the Department of Defence, of policy in relation to safety zones at the aerodrome. International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and recommendations in relation to obstacle limitation surfaces for airports, designed to protect the safety of aircraft as they land and take off by ensuring that there are no obstacles in the way, as well as considerations in regard to public safety in the vicinity of the aerodrome, were taken into account in determining the size and shape of the red safety areas at Casement Aerodrome. The areas are essentially two-dimensional surfaces on the ground originating 60 metres beyond the runway thresholds, have a width of 300 metres and diverge at a rate of 15% at each side to a width of 700 metres and have an overall length of 1370 metres in the case of each runway.  The Department's policy approach is that no new developments should be allowed within red safety areas. However, extensions to existing domestic dwellings are acceptable in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3669">While the Snow Report, referred to by the Deputy, contains discourse in relation to the restriction of development under the approach surfaces at Casement Aerodrome, the recommendation in the case of Casement Aerodrome contained in the report was that approach areas be retained for security and safety reasons because of the large proportion of training, including single engine/solo flights by inexperienced pilots, carried out at the aerodrome.  The matter will, however, be kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3671">To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  This arrangement operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.   This service is free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_3672">The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase, leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites. A significant finding from the pilot scheme is that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it was necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I approved further collections of waste silage/bale wrap by Leitrim, Roscommon, Carlow, Longford, North Tipperary and Wicklow County Councils which recently concluded.   Announcements regarding further extensions of collections to other areas, including Kilkenny, will follow a review of this second phase of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3684">Under the provisions of Section 40 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning permission is normally granted for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the granting of permission.

            <p eId="para_3685">Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority, which can take action where a development does not comply with the terms of its planning permission.  The 2000 Act introduced strengthened arrangements for enforcement by planning authorities in relation to unauthorised developments.  There is now a statutory obligation on a planning authority to issue a warning letter regarding unauthorised development in defined circumstances and to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued. In addition, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 empowered planning authorities to refuse permission to any developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission: in such a case the developer will have to go to the High Court if he/she wishes to apply to have this decision overturned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3686">Under Section 156 of the 2000 Act, a person who is found guilty on indictment of an enforcement offence is liable to a fine of up to €12.7m, or to imprisonment for up to 2 years, or to both.</p>
            <p eId="para_3687">Sections 34(4)(g) and 180(2)(b) of the 2000 Act also provide that in order to ensure that estates are completed satisfactorily, a planning authority may attach a condition to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a development, and, if the development is not subsequently completed satisfactorily, may apply the security to that satisfactory completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3688">Accordingly, it is clear that planning authorities have very substantial powers to compel the completion of housing estates, and any amenity type development, by developers in accordance with the terms of the planning permissions.</p>

         further to the confirmation by way of reply to Parliamentary Question No. 358 of 7 February 2006 that there have been no aircraft accidents whatsoever or associated third party fatalities in any of the red zones at any of the State airports since their introduction in 1968, if he will explain the rationale for the replacement of such massive red zones with the proposed but even larger public safety zones with such fact perhaps best exemplified by the replacement of the approximately 230 hectares existing red zone at the eastern end of Runway 10/28 at Dublin Airport by an outer public safety zone having an area of approximately 1,073 hectares; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3690">I am advised that it has been the practice since 1968 to limit development in areas known as "red zones" around the 3 state airports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon, for reasons both of air navigation safety and public safety.  In 2000, my Department and the Department of Transport jointly commissioned Environment Resource Management (ERM) to review the specific issue of addressing public safety on the ground around the major airports, based on current scientific practice.  In assessing this matter, ERM used recent advances in risk modelling techniques which made it possible to quantify the risks to the public on the ground from aircraft crashes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3691">The recommendations of ERM were that the use of the "red zones" should be discontinued for public safety purposes.  Public safety zones should instead be introduced, of a different size and shape to "red zones", and should have varying levels or development restrictions within them, depending on what type of development is proposed at different points.  It will be important for example to be able to restrict building heights near runways to ensure that obstacle clearance surfaces for departing and arriving aircraft are maintained, in line with the State's obligations under the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944.  Public safety zones would also be designed to protect the public on the ground from the small but real possibility that an aircraft might crash in a populated area and to ensure, as far as possible, that there are not large concentrations of people continually in the areas most at risk from crashes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3692">Draft Planning Guidelines on public safety zones around Dublin, Cork, and Shannon Airports are being prepared by my Department and are almost complete. In this context due consideration is being given to the ERM recommendations, including recommendations relating to the "red zones".  It is intended to issue the draft Guidelines for public consultation shortly under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  All comments received during the consultation process will be considered before the guidelines are finalised and issued under Section 28 of the 2000 Act.</p>
