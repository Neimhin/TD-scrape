#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the criticisms of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the purchase of Thornton Hall in north Dublin for a prison and the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to make a statement on his responsibility for the waste of taxpayers' money involved and the need to stop this project going ahead at an unsuitable location.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the stated position of the Minister for Finance, who informed me by parliamentary reply in February 2006 that the volume and type of business conducted at Weston Aerodrome does not justify the deployment of a permanent customs presence there.  However, the seizure of approximately 50 kg of drugs, the arrest of five individuals and the impounding of a jet belonging to the aerodrome's owner strongly highlights the error of the Minister's position.  A total of 18 visits by customs officials in the space of a year does not provide sufficient protection from wrongdoers and the Minister must now deploy full customs cover or suspend Weston's licence.

This morning, the deputy leader of the Progressive Democrats went on national radio and stated that this House is the forum in which questions should be asked and answered.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I would like the Deputy to hear the Chair first and I will then hear him.  As the Deputy is well aware, there are Standing Orders.  The Order of Business is very specific.  However, there are many ways in which Deputies can raise any issue they wish in this House.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	26	On RTE television on the "Six-One" news, or on "Morning Ireland".
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	27	There are many ways, including Private Members' business and by way of substantive motions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The Ceann Comhairle is right.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Fortunately, for the House and for the Chair we cannot use Standing Orders to raise any issue we wish.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	30	There are many ways to do so and this is one of them.  It may well be that on an occasion we might try to raise this issue here but the Tánaiste might not be in attendance.  I asked him did he ever receive a payment for a function he attended at which he spoke as a Minister or does he know of any Minister who received such payment?The statement he issued yesterday, in his capacity as Tánaiste, leaves the scales of justice unevenly balanced.  He seems to have a difficulty in determining whether the Taoiseach was right or wrong in accepting €50,000 and a further €12,000 for a speaking engagement in Manchester.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	31	There is no provision now for Leaders' Questions.  I will hear a brief comment from the Leaders of the four parties and a response from the Tánaiste.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The PDs voted down the opportunity to ask questions in the House yesterday.  In respect of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Tánaiste proposes to bring in amendments to that Act which, in the first place, will ensure that Ministers in Government are not entitled to receive €100,000 interest free loans which apparently are not currently in breach of the Act.  Does he intend to introduce an amendment to that Act which will allow him, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to determine whether some Ministers in receipt of gifts, interest free loans or money are either ethically correct or unethically wrong?  That is what he has done.  His determination of the Taoiseach's action as being an honest error of judgment is simply incredible in his capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Tánaiste and deputy leader of the Government.  Is it the Tánaiste's  intention to maintain his view that inequality is good for society and that inequality in the interpretation of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and of the Cabinet regulations that applied before that, applied to some Ministers whom he determined were right in some cases and wrong in others?

The Chair has stated that it will hear the leaders of the four parties.  It is out of order under Standing Orders but the Chair will allow a brief——-
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	36	What Standing Order is that?

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I ask Deputies to behave themselves and have respect for the Chair when I am speaking.  I point out to Deputy Rabbitte that I will hear from the leaders of the four parties and then a reply from the Tánaiste, if he wishes to reply,  and then we will move on to other business.  We are not having a debate on the issue, therefore it is not my intention to call the Tánaiste and then call each leader in turn to raise the same issue.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The Chair has already been liberal in allowing a comment in respect of which there is a number of precedents, but there is no precedent for having a wholesale debate on a Thursday morning.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I am not accustomed to the Ceann Comhairle berating me into speaking, but in the circumstances and now that the Chair has called me I will try to think of something to say.  I certainly do not know under what Standing Order the Chair has made this decision.I take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the Tánaiste on his appointment and to wish him well.  Any morning one wakes up to hear that a hit man has been executed, a house sprayed with bullets, a garda wounded and €10 million of drugs landed at a private airport, it is clear that the Tánaiste needs all the assistance we can offer him on this side of House.Will the Tánaiste spell out what he meant on radio when he said that Dáil Éireann would have an opportunity to discuss the controversy that has grown up around the Taoiseach's acceptance of a large sum of money for private use?  This morning his deputy leader, Deputy O'Donnell, said she looked forward to the matter being ventilated adequately in the House.  Will the Tánaiste indicate what provision he intends to make to allow the House to have the question and answer session that Deputy O'Donnell offered on radio this morning?  We did not have such a session yesterday and it is important that we dispose of it.Is there any particular reason the Tánaiste did not refer to the Manchester money in his statement?  Will he cause any action to be taken to establish whether the Revenue Commissioners gave clearance to the payments involved?  Are we now in a situation where the Tánaiste's party is giving only qualified support to the Government?  Am I correct in interpreting his statement as meaning that the payments in question were manifestly a gift and not repayable loans?  Are we in a position where this morning Deputy O'Donnell seemed to be qualifying even the qualified support for Government?  Will the Tánaiste ensure that this House will have an opportunity to probe these issues satisfactorily so that Dáil Éireann can discharge its responsibility to hold the Government accountable?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I take this opportunity to congratulate my constituency colleague on his elevation to the position of PD leader and Tánaiste, but I must leave that aside for the moment.  Does the Tánaiste accept that it was fundamentally wrong for the Minister for Finance at the time, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to accept payments for a speaking engagement in Manchester?  Does he agree that this was in breach of an ethical code?  Has he had serious discussions with the Taoiseach on this matter?  Has he discussed the Manchester payment with the Taoiseach?  Does he recall when he was out of politics, saying that the party that stands for anything stands for nothing?  Is it now the case that his party stands for very little except its own self-advancement?

He knows only too well that the Taoiseach was in breach of ethical guidelines.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	173	There is a serious onus on the Ceann Comhairle to respond to what the Tánaiste said.  The Ceann Comhairle heard him say that next Tuesday at Taoiseach's Questions any Member could put down questions on the Manchester payments and that the Taoiseach would answer them.  The Ceann Comhairle must tell us now whether he will allow such questions and if we will have that opportunity next Tuesday.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	175	Will the Ceann Comhairle let me finish my point of order?  The deadline for Taoiseach's Questions next Tuesday has passed.  The Ceann Comhairle must tell us if he will be as flexible as he was this morning in allowing those questions to stand and to be taken next Tuesday.  That is the minimum that is asked.

The Chair will give no assurance as to what questions will be answered next Tuesday.  It is decided in accordance with the rules of this House.  Questions that go on the Order Paper for next Tuesday will be answered when their turn comes.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The Ceann Comhairle's answer to Deputy Joe Higgins's question puts the matter in context.  On national radio this morning a spokesperson for the Government, the deputy leader of the junior partner in Government, gave us to understand that there were significant unanswered questions and that the survival of the Government was conditional on satisfactory answers being provided in this House.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	185	That does not arise.

It is reasonable for the Opposition Parties to ask of the Tánaiste in measured terms, what arrangements are being put in place to fulfil that commitment.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Either the Ceann Comhairle or the Tánaiste is incorrect.  The deadline has passed and the Ceann Comhairle has said he will not extend it.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Deputy Burton, will you resume your seat?  The Chair will be left with no choice but to ask you to leave.

The Chair will hear him.  To be clear on the question raised by Deputy Joe Higgins — Deputy Joe Higgins asked about ordinary questions that go to the Taoiseach if the Chair could guarantee that they will be answered next Tuesday.  The Chair cannot give any such guarantee because they will be answered in accordance with Standing Orders.  It is not within my prerogative to say when they might arise.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I call Deputy Gilmore.  Will Deputies show respect to colleagues in the House?

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I withdraw it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	206	As I understand the Constitution, the Government is accountable to this House, the Parliament of the people.  An issue of very serious accountability has arisen in relation to the Taoiseach.  The House requires answers to some questions.  The leader of my party has asked the Tánaiste, who is taking the Order of Business, what are the arrangements for the discharge of that.  In response he said we could put down questions for next Tuesday, although the deadline has passed.  Based on precedent, if we put down a question to the Taoiseach about something he did as Minister for Finance, the question will be transferred to the current Minister for Finance while the Taoiseach takes cover.  We have to establish from the Tánaiste what arrangements are to be made for the accountability of the head of the Government to this House for the matters we wish to raise with him.  We want to do that in an orderly way, making the job of the Ceann Comhairle and this House easier.  I again ask the Tánaiste to tell this House what arrangements are to be put in place and in what period of time.  I do not want smart responses that we can put down questions to the Taoiseach or raise them during Leaders' Questions.  I want to know what time will be provided for the House to ask these questions and to make the Taoiseach accountable.  It is a straightforward matter and I want a straight answer from the Tánaiste.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Since a debate has not been promised by a Member of the Government it does not arise on the Order of Business.  For the information of Deputy Gilmore it is possible to raise these matters in several ways in the House, by substantive motion, on Private Members' time and on Leaders' Questions.  These means are open to Members of this House to raise any issue.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	208	The Tánaiste promised a debate.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Is the Tánaiste sorry he took the job?  It is more difficult than he thought.  He is making a mess of it on the first day.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	216	On a point of order, the question was not whether a debate was promised.  There is long-standing precedent that on important political issues the Opposition can request from Government——

I suggest that the normal course in this House is for the Whips to meet.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Perhaps Deputy O'Donnell made an honest error of judgment when she said that the House is the place to be accountable for these matters.  I accept what the Tánaiste has said, that the Whips can meet about this.  In his capacity as acting Head of Government today can the Tánaiste give his imprimatur to the effect that, when the Whips meet, a proposal from the Fine Gael and Labour Whips will result in Government time being made available next week for a statement by the Taoiseach, to be followed by questions and answers from all Members of the House, about the fact that a serving Minister for Finance received €12,000 for a speaking engagement?  I need the Tánaiste's imprimatur that when the Whips meet a proposal to have Government time next Tuesday will be approved.  Can the Tánaiste give that assurance now?

It is a time-honoured precedent in the House that the Government proposes through the Government Whip the order of the business for the House.  The Tánaiste could have done that in the past half hour.  I am glad to accept the word of the Chief Whip that without any doubt or equivocation there will be provision for a question and answer session.  I welcome that arrangement.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I accept that.  To be absolutely clear, when the meeting takes place with the Chief Whip after the Order of Business, will the Chief Whip confirm when the Government will consider the request from the Opposition Whips, or will he make that decision himself?  Can we take it now, before we leave the House, that we will have the time and questions and answers or does the Tánaiste's comment that the Government will consider that refer to next Tuesday's Cabinet meeting?

Many Deputies recall the appalling footage we saw on our television screens some months ago, when an RTE documentary highlighted the lack of care given to elderly people who were residing in Leas Cross nursing home at a heavy cost to their sons, daughters and loved ones.  I am sure what we saw on that occasion was the exception rather than the rule.  I would like to think that is the case.  All of us are aware of private nursing homes in our constituencies which offer a tremendous level of care to elderly people.  Such nursing homes should be commended for the care they offer.  That care comes at a great expense to many people, however, as I have said.  I feel very strongly about this issue.Legislation is being brought through this House to put on a statutory footing the scheme whereby the relatives of those who were cared for in public nursing homes and hospitals will receive repayments.  I am familiar with the level of care that has been given and will continue to be given to elderly people.  There is a stark difference between public care and private care.  As a result of a court decision, the State has to refund many millions of euro to people who have not asked for such moneys.  The vast majority of such people are more than satisfied with the level of care that was offered in public hospitals and nursing homes.  Many of my constituents contact me through my constituency office and at my clinics to ask me if I can help them to place their elderly relatives in public hospitals and nursing homes.  I cannot interfere in such cases, unfortunately, as I have little influence on the clinical decisions made by the hospital managers and the consultants who care for elderly people.The State has to pay back substantial moneys.  I understand, from what I have heard, that many people who are entitled to get money back are refusing to take it.  I suggest to the Minister for Health and Children that such moneys should be directly repaid in enhanced subvention.  Members of the House have spoken in recent days about the discrepancies in subvention between the former health board regions.  It is something that needs to be reviewed and regularised so every member of the community can compete on a level playing pitch, regardless of where they reside.  I know of many people who are at their wits' end because they are trying to put their children through college.  While there may be four or five children in a family in some cases, just one or two of the children take responsibility for paying for their parents' care.  The financial gap between the money available from the parents' old age pensions, with the subventions they get from the State, and the money needed to finance their care often needs to be bridged on a weekly or monthly basis by the children of the people in question.  I would like the Government to make a greater effort to allocate more funding and resources to enhanced subvention.  As legislators, we should recognise the great financial need that exists in many cases.  That is more important than being obliged by law to recognise the needs of people who were very well cared for in public nursing homes to receive repayments.Those of us who saw the footage from Leas Cross had never before seen such footage from inside a public institution and I believe we never again will.  It spoke volumes.  I do not want to be negative — I hope Leas Cross was an isolated incident.

#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	332	What we saw was appalling, but an investigation has taken place.  It is right that we should want to know the results of that investigation as quickly as possible to ensure we do not have a repeat of the Leas Cross incident.  It is important we acknowledge the results of the investigation and deal with them at the earliest possible time.  However, the Health Service Executive has stated that if the report is published, the matter could end up in the courts.  None of us would like that to happen because it could cause the process to be delayed for months or even years.  Sensible solutions have to be found.  All of us have a responsibility to ensure that what happened at Leas Cross is not repeated.  The lessons which have been learned from the Leas Cross incident must be put into practice to ensure that those elderly people who need it can benefit from a proper, decent and good level of nursing care.  It is the least that such people deserve, having made an important contribution to society.

Great work is being done for elderly people in my home county.  I refer to the nursing home in my home town and many other nursing homes across County Meath.  Some of my constituents stay in nursing homes in neighbouring counties.  I know of a person from my constituency who was resident in a nursing home in Deputy O'Dowd's home county of Louth.  Some of my constituents are staying in places like Virginia in County Cavan.  A few of my good friends have resided in the nursing home in Castlepollard, which is in Deputy Cassidy's constituency.  I am sure the Deputy will speak about that beautiful nursing home.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	337	Indeed.  I would like to refer to St. Joseph's county nursing home in Trim, County Meath.  I have been friends with many of its residents since the time when Meath County Council used to hold its Christmas meetings at St. Joseph's.  I have seen the great work that is being done at St. Joseph's, which serves all of County Meath.  The marvellous work being done for elderly people in Trim is a credit to the nursing staff of St. Joseph's and particularly to the matrons and former matrons there.  However, we cannot turn a blind eye to the failure of some nursing homes to do such great work.  We are glad that such shortcomings have been highlighted and we hope they will be stamped out for once and for all.  As we saw on our televisions and read in our newspapers, some poor and unfortunate people, who contributed significantly to the economy and made this country what it is today, have been subjected to disgraceful treatment.  We must never lose sight of the fact that many people who are now in nursing homes worked in difficult times, when there was no such thing as a booming economy. Many of them went to work on empty stomachs.  They worked hard to build the country.  It is sad those same people have been neglected in some nursing homes.  Shame on those who allowed this to happen.This year an additional €20 million was allocated to the nursing home subvention scheme for residents of private nursing homes.  This represents an increase of 14% over 2005, an estimated spend of €140 million.  This additional €20 million will go towards supporting increasing numbers entitled to basic nursing home subventions, reducing waiting lists for enhanced subventions and bringing greater consistency to the different levels of enhanced subvention support.Regulations were recently made to make the assessment criteria for subventions, not updated since 1993, reflect major changes in property values.  The property ceiling that was set at €95,000 in the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 will be increased, having regard to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government house price indices, to €500,000 for the Dublin area and €300,000 for the rest of the country.  The assets ceiling will also be increased to €36,000 from €25,359.  Previously, the first €7,618 of an applicant's assets would be disregarded when applying for a subvention.  It will be increased to €11,000.How much time have I left?

Where an applicant's principal residence is not constantly occupied by a relative, the HSE shall exclude 95% of the estimated market value of the principal residence from the financial assessment of the applicant and where 5% of the market value of the principal residence shall be taken into account.  The Bill provides for this percentage to be amended by way of further regulations so that a high percentage of a principal residence will be excluded from the assessment.The interdepartmental group on long-term care reported to the Government which took on board several principles contained in the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The agreement described a range of initiatives covering new arrangements for residential and community-based care for older people.  Progress to date in implementing actions in the long-term care report includes the HSE developing a national standardised care needs assessment and a standardised financial assessment process for home care packages.  A needs analysis of residential care requirements for older people has been finalised by the HSE.  National protocols for case management for home care packages are being developed by the HSE as part of the guidelines' roll-out.  A planning exercise on staffing requirements for future developments for older people and the disabled is being undertaken by the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  A cross-departmental team on sheltered housing will be established and chaired by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Work will include other groups such as the disabled.  A steering committee will be set up to begin the preparatory work of evaluating the effectiveness of the additional home care packages.Work is continuing on the development of a financially sustainable system of funding long-term care, a new scheme whereby those in private and public facilities would be eligible for the same level of State support, rendering the system more equitable.  The new system will propose appropriate levels of co-payments by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  Standard consultation with carers' representative organisations, on a cross-departmental basis, will be led by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

It is one that all Members wish never took place.  It is a wake-up call and Members must do their duty to ensure the same never takes place again.  Having served on the Midland Health Board for over 18 years, I acknowledge the great work done by the nursing and professional medical staff in caring for all patients and improving standards immensely, compared to what they used to be many years ago.The cherished people in our community are our senior citizens.  These are the parents and grandparents who did not experience the buoyant economy we now have.  They encountered many difficulties from the First World War, the Rising, the Civil War, the depression, the Second World War and other challenges.  These people, now in their 70s, 80s and 90s, the autumn of their lives, should be enjoying their retirement in comfort.  Members get no pleasure in seeing how they can assist the Minister for Health and Children and her Department in addressing the experience of Leas Cross nursing home.  We must be thankful to the RTE investigative team which brought this experience to the knowledge of Members and the public which proved what we were witnessing was not hearsay or some allegation but a fact.The people about whom we are speaking are the cherished generation.  Members on all sides of the political divide want to do all they can for them, especially in this time of plenty.  The economy cannot be blamed for lack of action.  When I became a Member of the Oireachtas in the 1980s, representing rural areas of counties Westmeath and Longford, it was often said that many objectives could be achieved were it not for the dreadful shortage of money.  We can no longer use that excuse because money is now available.  A particularly sad aspect of this matter is that there are currently 100 to 150 bed vacancies that could be filled if the correct structures were in place to allow people avail of the facilities to which they should have access.  With careful planning, such facilities would be available in the north County Dublin area.Deputy Cregan mentioned the subvention for the elderly.  My experience with constituents in the midlands suggests that the subvention must be examined and addressed seriously.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who is a former Minister for Health and Children has vast experience in this area.  I hope he will, in the forthcoming budget, seriously examine the regulations in regard to this subvention.  One must be almost penniless before one can avail of it.  The full subvention seems to be given only to people who have no home in their name, practically no money in the post office or bank and are confined to bed and unable to move around independently.  Unless he or she is in dire circumstances, a person of 80, 90 or even 100 years of age will find it difficult to qualify for the full subvention.  The excellent staff of the HSE have little discretion in this matter but must follow the regulations.  A person with any more than €20,000 and a small cottage, for example, is not entitled to a subvention.  This situation is unsatisfactory.  Patients always live in hope that they will recover and be able to return to their own home.The carer's allowance currently amounts to €180 per week.  A decent increase in this payment might allow people to take time off work to look after an elderly relative in their home.  In such cases, the elderly person would have no need to go to a nursing home.  Carers are one of the groups of unsung heroes in our communities.  I have often said such people should get a gold medal for the sacrifices they make and their dedication to the communities they serve.  They are fantastic people.  Now that the economy is strong, we should show our appreciation by including in the next budget a substantial increase in the allowance.  In many instances, people would not have to go to a nursing home if such an increase were granted and a substantial discretion allowed to HSE officials in local areas in assessing their needs.  Perhaps two carers could be assigned to look after a person in his or her own home, for example, one during the day and the other at night.We are fortunate in Westmeath and surrounding areas to have many magnificent facilities such as the Maple Court nursing home in Castlepollard, which I often visit, the St. Camillus centre in Killucan, the Newbrook nursing home in Mullingar, Portiuncula Hospital, and the facilities in Multyfarnham and Tyrrellspass.  The proposition before us today is one from which we can all learn.  We may show our determination in this regard by assuring the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, that he will have our support should he seek increased funding from the Minister for Finance in the forthcoming budget.

It is good that we in this House should reflect public concerns about this issue.I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children which was attended by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the chief executive of the HSE, Professor Brendan Drumm.  I got more excited at that meeting than is usual for me so I am happy to come to this Chamber where everything is calm and in which I may calmly make my contribution on this serious matter.

He tended to my father during his last illness in St. James's Hospital and he is now an eminent consultant in Tallaght Hospital where he does tremendous work.  I could not but expect that his report would reflect his particular care.  Members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children received copies this morning of the opinion of legal counsel on these issues.  Political points have been made in respect of whether the report should be published.  I am of the view that whatever is required to allow for publication should be done.  That is what the public require and all of us wish to be confident that everything possible is done to ensure that the care given to elderly people in nursing homes is universally of a first class nature.My colleague, Senator Glynn, made a fair point on this issue which reflects my experience as a member of the former Eastern Health Board, which I joined in 1994.  When the health boards were abolished there was much criticism of the visiting committees and of the practice of allocating expenses to councillors.  The reality, however, is that they played an important role.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, on the improvements in the funding of services for elderly people.  I have three points to make and I ask the Minister of State to take note of them.  I have heard there are difficulties in Laois and Offaly relating to travel expenses for those who approve people for home help.  People in need of home help in this region are not receiving it.  I was told last night that the next meeting between the union and the Health Service Executive is scheduled for the end of October.  It should happen now.  The difficulties need to be solved because people are suffering while the home help issue is being addressed.I welcome the meals on wheels service.  However, I was involved with the Chairman of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service in highlighting the fact that commercial operators are providing this service in some cases and those in receipt of the service are obliged to pay VAT.  This is an anomaly.  There is no VAT on services for children's crèches and there should not be any charged to people receiving meals on wheels.  Discussions are taking place between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance and I ask that they be brought to a conclusion.  If this requires legislation then it should be dealt with as soon as possible.I approach the issue of Leas Cross nursing home as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I welcome Professor Des O'Neill's report.  Who owns this report and has the intellectual rights to it?  If Professor O'Neill has the intellectual rights then it is not the property of the HSE.  If the HSE has the rights to it they are free to make amendments to it unilaterally without consulting Professor O'Neill.  It seems these issues were not satisfactorily addressed when the contract for the report was written.  This happens throughout the public service.  Those drawing up commercial contracts with outside individuals do not always do what is required.  It seems that either Professor O'Neill or the HSE has the right to issue the report or make amendments.I welcome the additional support and funding the Minister for Health and Children will provide in this area.

Had his privacy legislation been in place, the recent stories relating to payments to the Taoiseach would not have emerged.  The purpose of that legislation is to protect the most powerful and wealthy people in society.  I believe this is the function of the neo-conservative Progressive Democrats.  There is very little accountability.

A report conducted by an eminent professor, who lives in my constituency, has been suppressed.  Power was vested in him to make an assessment and he did his job thoroughly.  This was not a form of tribunal.  Of course, the findings of his report were not to the liking of certain people in powerful positions.  The HSE is protecting individuals when it ought to protect the most vulnerable people in society, the elderly.  The HSE's priorities are wrong.The point made by the previous speaker is valid.  We must consider who owns this report and what were the terms of reference.  Professor O'Neill has done his job well and, as far as he is concerned, that is the end of the matter.  He will not return to make amendments.  We should listen to what he says.There are major questions concerning accountability in our health system.  I was recently made aware of a serious case of malpractice and negligence which raises the issue of recourse open to relatives.  It seems to be a closed shop.  Had it not been for RTE's investigative journalism we would not have seen the appalling conditions in Leas Cross.Leas Cross was not an isolated incident.  I put it to the Minister for Health and Children recently that many nursing homes received adverse reports.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Mr. Seán Power, said he would produce the relevant report and give me the names of those nursing homes.  I still have not received it for the same reason Professor O'Neill's report is being suppressed.  We may refer to natural justice and giving people an opportunity but these people must be held to account.  It is a feature of society that those who behave badly are not held responsible.The most vulnerable people in society have been treated like a commodity to assist in generating as much money as possible.  I have heard stories of people refused a glass of milk when thirsty and given a single slice of bread spread thinly with margarine.  These are all cost saving measures that have been used.  People have been heavily drugged and put to bed early so they would not cause trouble at night.  They may be left to lie in their own urine.  These are appalling stories, yet they continue.  The suppression of this report is further evidence that the Government, so wedded to the market and profit, will allow this to continue.I am sharing time with my colleagues, the Independent Members.  I thank Professor O'Neill for his work and I hope his report is published as soon as possible.

I gcás tuairiscí eile, mar shampla, an ceann ón Ghiúistís Barron ar bhuamáil Bhaile Átha Cliath agus Mhuineacháin agus ionsaithe eile sa Stát seo a dhein Rialtas Shasana in éineacht le dílseoirí, rinneadh cinnte de gur foilsíodh iad i ndiaidh dóibh bheith curtha ar aghaidh chuig coiste cuí an Oireachtais.  Dhein sé seo cinnte de go raibh na tuairiscí seo clúdaithe ag pribhléid Dála, agus lig sé do na coistí sin déileáil le hachainíocha ó dhaoine eile ar bhonn na dtuairiscí sin.I see no reason why Professor O'Neill's report on Leas Cross cannot be published in the same manner as that outlined.  Has the Government considered this option?  I urge it to do so and publish the report in the manner I have suggested.  The non-publication of this report means we are debating in a vacuum.  It is almost unprecedented that the author of a report commissioned by the Government has had to issue a public statement urging its publication.  It has been with the Minister for Health and Children since May.  Why is the Minister now telling us that she believes a way can be found to publish this report?  What has she been doing since May?  The report should have been published a long time ago.  Professor O'Neill correctly pointed out that he cannot now be expected to carry out a further investigation going beyond the terms of reference of his original investigation because of the refusal, so far, of the Government to publish his report.When we first debated the Leas Cross scandal, Deputy Ó Caoláin, on behalf of my party, stated in this House that the questions in people’s minds after the “Prime Time” programme were very simple.  Why did all the organs of the State fail to protect those vulnerable old people?  Why did it take a television programme to expose the scandal when such homes were supposed to be governed by the rule of law, bound by regulations and subject to inspection?  In the absence of the publication of Professor O’Neill’s report, we still do not have answers to those questions.  Vulnerable older people and their families are still concerned about the level of protection they are offered by the State.  The Government has failed to fulfil its commitment, given by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children, that an independent nursing home inspectorate would be established.  That inspectorate was promised by the Government for 2005 but is still not in place.  That is a scandal in itself.The former profiteers of the Leas Cross nursing home benefited from tax incentives for the development of that facility.  Tax incentives have been used by many developers to build such facilities and we challenge the use of public money in this way.  The Department of Finance report on tax incentives asserts that this tax incentive scheme was one of the factors leading to an increased number of nursing home places.  However, it also states: "There is considerable variation across different regions in the number of nursing home beds per capita, the costs to the operator per bed, the rate charged per bed and the average occupancy rates.”  The report further states:The weekly cost of places has risen over the last number of years.  Indecon survey evidence suggests that the tax incentive scheme had been ineffective in reducing the increase in the cost of nursing home accommodation.This clearly shows the flawed Government approach of using tax incentives for developers as a means of delivering an important social service, that is, care of the elderly.  The money foregone by the State through such tax incentives would have been better spent in direct provision of care for the elderly in the home, in day care centres and in residential homes established and run by the Health Service Executive and by not-for-profit organisations.I support the motion and oppose the Government amendment.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Leas Cross nursing home and the wider issue of the elderly.  I strongly support the call for legislation to provide for an independent, statutorily based inspection regime for all nursing homes and for this legislation to be brought forward as a matter of urgency.  I also support the motion's call for all inspection reports to be made directly available to residents of nursing homes and their families.However, I warn the large parties with regard to past mistakes.  I accept and acknowledge that there are some legal difficulties in the HSE publishing the Leas Cross report.  I warn all parties to take note because in the past, major mistakes have been made and hundreds of thousands of euro of taxpayers' money was spent because of serious mistakes and bad legal advice.  In that context, I urge caution.I wish to raise the issue of the bureaucratic delays for all pensioners and elderly citizens, of 14 to 16 weeks, in having the pension and bus pass claims processed.  I raise this matter today because elderly people must be supported.  They built up this country and the Celtic tiger.  I also urge the Minister to put more community gardaí on the streets to protect elderly people.Our senior citizens are experiencing severe economic difficulties, limitations in access to health services and a lack of social services.  They are also suffering considerable shortcomings in their housing and living conditions, exclusion from culture and education, inappropriate treatment and have scant opportunity for participation in social and political life.  These forms of discrimination and inequality, based on chronological age, are experienced by many groups of older people.  I urge Members to listen to the concerns of elderly people because they built this country.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I wish to record my support for this motion, particularly with regard to the inspection of nursing homes.  Inspections are vitally important and the inspection regime should be statutorily based.  Furthermore, inspection reports should be freely and openly available to the public.One important issue which relates to this debate is the lack of sufficient long-stay beds for the elderly in the public system.  Excellent work is being done in the public system, for example, in places like St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel, St. Anthony's unit in Clonmel, and the district hospitals in Tipperary, Carrick-on-Suir and Clogheen in my constituency, but there are not enough beds.  As a consequence, elderly people experience enormous delays in gaining access to the beds that are available.  The result is that some people die before they ever gain admission to these facilities and many more are forced to go into the private nursing home system only to find there are enormous costs involved.Let us take the case of an individual whose only income is a social welfare payment, who does not own his own home but rents a house from the local authority and has no savings or investments.  The maximum subvention that individual will receive in the former South Eastern Health Board area is €250 per week.  The minimum charge in a nursing home in the same area is €550 per week.  If the individual concerned receives a social welfare payment of €200, he is short €100 per week, with no way of making up the balance, except to ask his relations and friends to give him a so-called dig out, similar to that received by the Taoiseach in 1993 and 1994.  However, if the individual's friends are not in a position to give him a dig out, as it were, his family will have to scrimp and scrape to ensure he is looked after in a private nursing home.  In that context, it is vitally important that additional public nursing home long-stay beds for the elderly are made available.Another related issue concerns elderly people being looked after in their own homes — the Government amendment refers to this issue.  Unfortunately, however, the home help service has been ravaged and reduced by the Government.  The payment of carer's allowances is also an enormously difficult area.  People are waiting up to six months for approval of an application for a carer's allowance.  Where appeals are lodged, people are waiting for 12 months for a final decision.  I ask the Minister to examine this area without delay.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	358	In discussing the O'Neill report into Leas Cross, it is important to remember that 105 people died between 2000 and 2005, either at the nursing home itself or following transfer to hospital from Leas Cross.  The families of all those people are entitled to the immediate release of the report.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has repeatedly told us that there are legal issues involved and that her legal advisers are examining the options.  Where were those legal experts when the terms of reference for the inquiry were drawn up?  Did the Minister think no-one would be blamed for anything?The most amazing aspect of this saga is that the owners of Leas Cross have no problem with publication of the report.  The report, I believe, accepts that while the mortality rate of 38% at the home was higher than expected, none of the deaths was preventable.  The first draft of the report has been with the Minister since February of this year.  The final report does not, as I understand it, differ greatly from the draft report, but seven months later we still await its publication.  That is simply not good enough.  Perhaps I should not be surprised at the delay in publishing the O'Neill report, given how long the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, sat on the report into the activities of Bord na gCon.  The crucial difference here, however, is that 105 people died and, while none of those deaths may have been preventable, the families of those people are entitled to know whether staffing levels at Leas Cross were adequate and whether the staff had appropriate training.  They are also entitled to know if proper work practices were in place at the home and if lessons have been learned so others will not suffer what their loved ones suffered.If the Minister cannot obtain immediate approval to publish the report, it should be released to the Oireachtas without delay.  I shudder at how long it will take to implement the recommendations of the report given how long it is taking to publish it.A national register to monitor vulnerable patients is an absolute necessity and the necessary resources should be made available instantly to maintain such a register.  The recommendations to have a register, proper inspection procedures and free availability of inspection reports to residents and the families of residents require action now.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	359	Leas Cross serves as an example of the murky side of the care of the elderly but it can also serve as a very valuable lesson on how the system can and should be reconfigured to eliminate unacceptable circumstances, such as those in which older people are treated so badly.  The example of Leas Cross proves conclusively, without any report, that the inspection system is not working.  The rotten apple in the pile was Leas Cross and it was not detected.It would be reassuring to believe there are no more Leas Crosses but unfortunately we cannot say there are none.  What can we do?  Promises made by Government to have an independent inspectorate must be honoured as soon as possible.  An inspection system is also needed for the public sector because the Health Service Executive, as a service provider, is in a position in which it can check itself.The service should be independent.  The system must ensure that proper standards of care are maintained and this should be the primary focus of any inspection system.  The over-bureaucratising of the inspection process must be resisted at all costs and minor matters must be regarded as such and good endeavour must be acknowledged properly.  Since the Government has abdicated the care of older people to the private sector, it is doing less and less in getting rid of public beds.Community facilities must be encouraged and acknowledged properly.  Full care for older folks, and adequately supported care are so important.  While the vast majority of private nursing homes are doing a fantastic job, on foot of the State abdicating responsibility to them by closing public facilities, there is an understandable element of cherry-picking because of the heavy demands of those who need very high levels of support.I call for a special provision above and beyond what is available for enhanced subvention for community units with no profit margin written into the equation to ensure there is somewhere vulnerable people can go to receive a very high level of support in their own community.  Currently such patients often end up in hospital and are sent out blindly therefrom to institutions which do not have adequate resources to look after them properly.  It is not good enough to send people from institutions without seeing where they are going and ensuring they are looked after properly.

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The delay in the publication of Professor Des O'Neill's report into the number of deaths at Leas Cross nursing home is unacceptable.  Relatives of those who died in Leas Cross are entitled to see for themselves the full findings of the report.  We know the report was concluded as far back as April of this year and there is simply no excuse for further delaying its publication.  For the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to state the HSE should resolve its difficulties with Professor O'Neill is not good enough.  She is the Minister and has direct responsibility to ensure nursing homes are safe and well run.The sections of the report quoted on "Six One News" last Thursday certainly vindicate the content of the "Prime Time" programme of last year.  They confirm that there were very serious problems in Leas Cross.  We also know from a number of HSE reports and from replies to parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health and Children that serious problems and discrepancies were by no means confined to Leas Cross.  This has been brought to the attention of various Ministers over the years.  These discrepancies pertain to hygiene problems, staff levels, the maintenance of accommodation, poor record-keeping and the lack of equipment appropriate to clinical practices.I could elaborate further in this regard but what is of real concern to me is that so little has been done to deal with these problems since they were first raised in this House.  For example, on the day following the "Prime Time" programme of last year the Taoiseach assured the Dáil that legislation to provide for the establishment of a nursing home inspectorate would be enacted before the end of the year.  Commitments were made as far back as 2002 but we are now talking about 2007.  How serious is the Department about bringing forward legislation to provide for the inspectorate, which inspectorate would have improved the conditions in which people were cared for at Leas Cross?This is no way to treat older people who rely on care in nursing homes or other institutions when they can no longer be cared for at home.  The only way to ensure the highest standards are in place and are being implemented is through the establishment of a statutory inspectorate with strong enforcement powers.  The present arrangement, whereby the HSE is inspecting itself, has proved to be ineffective and not in the interest of the patients.I have a brochure from the Leas Cross nursing home which dates from 2004.  One would think it was a brochure for a four or five star hotel.  It outlines the rates and the medical services provided and it refers to a 24-hour doctor service and to 24 beds which were ring-fenced for residents of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  I refer to this in the context of a case raised by a constituent of mine.  The constituent stated her 91-year-old uncle was a resident in Leas Cross from December 2002 until his death in July 2004.  She visited him three to seven days per week to look after him and acknowledged the changes that were taking place during the period in question.  She wrote to the Northern Area Health Board and subsequently to Professor O'Neill about the matter.  She referred to the lack of care, her uncle's fears in respect of another resident, his being knocked down on the ground and the fact that, after suffering from a broken hip, he was left in bed in pain and was not seen by a doctor until 3.50 p.m. three days later.  She outlined the delay in securing an X-ray.  A doctor in Beaumont Hospital stated her uncle was suffering from malnutrition.  These are the facts.  This lady and the relatives of the 103 residents who died at Leas Cross are entitled to see the report as quickly as possible.  It is up to the Government and the HSE to deal with this matter.The Northern Area Health Board, in its letter, acknowledged that the nursing home accepted that there had been a breakdown in procedure in respect of the care of the man in question and that it was committed to improving its protocols and procedures to ensure patients would be dealt with in a timely and appropriate manner.  This was ongoing.  People were making complaints to the health board at the time in question.  The health board also confirmed that the nursing home had prepared a new policy to ensure that difficulties experienced by the man in question would not arise again.  The health board's letter concluded that its team would continue to monitor the measure put in place by the management at Leas Cross.  It is clear that, well before the "Prime Time" special, relatives and friends of residents in Leas Cross had concerns, which they brought to the attention of the health board at the time.  The HSE must be brought to account, since it has questions to answer.  That legislation on an independent inspectorate has not been prioritised reflects the Government's lack of concern for one of society's most vulnerable groups, those no longer able to continue living in their own homes owing to age and infirmity.  The failures in the nursing home sector are well known.  What else must come to light for the Government to take action?  That it knows of the problem but is failing to do anything about it shows a lack of priority.  The current inspection process is unsatisfactory, but at least it provides some information about nursing homes.In previous debates, I stated there was absolutely no reason for inspection reports not to be routinely made available on the Internet.  Some progress has been made on that in recent weeks, but the information provided is totally inadequate in detail and substance.  The current social services inspectorate has been operating on a non-statutory basis for ten years.  We need legislation to put it on a statutory footing and the health and equality laws to ensure proper quality standards in all nursing homes, private and public.  Nothing less is acceptable.The motion before us calls for the publication of Professor O'Neill's report and the establishment of an independent inspectorate.  I have listened to the various contributions, and no one in the House could disagree with that.  It is therefore disgraceful that the Minister and the Government should decide to table an amendment.  The people need the right services available for their elderly relatives and friends.  Part of the problem in moving forward is publication of this report.  Let us publish it and allow the Minister to introduce the statutory inspectorate for which we have been calling and regarding which the public has been given commitments for the last four or five years.  Let us see action in that regard for the sake of the elderly.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this motion, which I support.  I compliment Deputies Twomey and O'Dowd and the other speakers who contributed in its support; it is timely, useful and particularly important.  When a report of this serious nature is compiled, I see no benefit to anyone in our sitting around and arguing legalities.  There is no sense in our commissioning a report unless we ultimately do something positive about it.  It is in everyone's interest for the report to be published without delay so all the information sought initially can be made available and the concerns expressed by those involved addressed.I compliment those nursing homes that have run their show well in recent years, of which there are very many.  The great majority do a tremendous job, provide great value for money, and look after patients in a very conscientious and caring way.  Very often they do it for patients who require high-dependency nursing but lack the family that might provide such care.  I compliment them on what they have done.  Several nursing home proprietors have taken financial responsibility for extending the stay of certain people for whom it proved impossible to secure funding from the health service or whatever other source.Having said that, there are others who have not adhered to the rules.  There is a growing perception that facilities of this nature constitute an investment rather than the provision of a vital social, nursing and medical service.  There is also a perception among HSE personnel that to draw attention to something of this kind is uncharitable, unworthy or unpatriotic.  For some years a culture has been growing in the health service of refusing to listen to the obvious.  We have all heard about haemophiliacs over the years, the reports, legal challenges and counter-challenges, and all the time and energy that went into their case.Deputy O'Connor mentioned something a few moments ago regarding the old health boards and the job that they did for 30 years.  They were supposed to do the job.  They were abolished, having been used as scapegoats in the run-up to an election because the health services found themselves in difficulties.  The Minister of the day decided to abolish the health boards to show the public his deep concern at the problem; we now know that it was no such thing.  Let us remember that in the period from 1970 there was an inspectorate like the visiting committees in the health boards that did the job it was supposed to do for nothing.  The difficulty was finding people to join visiting committees and give of their time.  It was regarded as a great thing if one was in time for one's tea.  That was an added bonus, as I well know, since I did it.  With many people, there developed over the years a culture that one had to be nice to everyone.  If one did that, it was thought that everything would be all right, but that is not true.I remember sitting in this House with other Deputies many years ago and bringing the kind of carry-on current in some health board institutions to the Minister's attention.  That was how the system was supposed to work; information was to percolate upwards through the system.  It was only right and had to continue, although we were not popular for doing it.  I do not wish to apportion unnecessary blame, except to say this.  In the HSE today there is a new system, which I regard as closed and bureaucratic.  It is not working in the way originally intended.  I never believed it would work, but that is irrelevant.  Abolishing the health boards was an abnegation of the democratic process, and their replacement is not yet visible.I also wish to mention the great number of people who are dedicated health workers, in both public and private sectors.  They do a tremendous job and display a vocational commitment that carries right through.  That commitment will always ensure they do the job to the best of their ability and stand over what they do.  They will be very quick to respond to any request for clarity at all times.However, there is a growing culture throughout the system whereby such vocational devotion does not seem as visible as previously.  There seems to be more reference to filling the job from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. than to the completion of the task originally intended.  One cannot walk off the job if a patient is in need of care.  I am not saying that it happens, but it certainly would not have occurred previously owing to the degree of commitment.As always, society is judged by how it treats the vulnerable who depend on it, whether the very young or the very old.  That responsibility falls on us at all times, but particularly when the country is thought to be overflowing with money.  It is supposed to be gushing out from everywhere.  There is so much money that one Minister said that the Government did not need it any more.  At this juncture, it is absolutely imperative that the highest standards, including regarding accountability, apply.  There is no need to be at all embarrassed if someone asks whether the relevant standards are being applied, and no need for anyone to get upset or worried.  There should be no reason; nor will there ever be.There is no question that what happened in Leas Cross was the result of system failure.  It is not the case that procedures were not in place or standards not applied.  If the system had been operating as intended, the problems would have been spotted and a report compiled.  There would have been no question of any legal interaction.  There is no necessity for it.  The challenges would be made on time.  I do not know why we have got to this stage.  The problem now is to reassert control to ensure the highest standards are applied at all times, not just some of the time.  Remember, that applies throughout both the public and private sectors.  incidentally, I recall many years ago there was a suggestion that standards in a hospital which was not the responsibility of the health board were not up to scratch.  It was quite clearly pointed out that the same standards applied right across the system, inside and outside; there was no sense in having health Acts and laying down standards unless they were applicable across the board.The importance of this debate should not be underestimated.  In particular we should emphasise that we should learn from the lessons the debate highlights and initiate the inspectorate that has been promised.  The Government amendment is appalling.  It is the lamest excuse I have ever seen, put into print.  This is no reflection on my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power.  I am sure he agrees with me.  However it was compiled or on what basis, I cannot believe it.  It is barefaced, incredible.  To produce that, one would need to have a neck like something else.

I support the motion.  I am amazed it has taken this long to drag out the publication.  As regards the health services, delay or procrastination in evidence over a number of years are not in the interests of obtaining the highest quality of standards and should be looked at again carefully.I again compliment those within both the public and the private health services who have done a good job.  Those who do a good job whether in the public or private sector and who go out of their way to give a good service towards achieving the highest possible standards have been let down by those who do not.  Unless the people whose task it is to enforce the standards do their job, the whole country is being let down, including the Houses of the Oireachtas and all the institutions.I support the motion.  I ask the Government to withdraw the amendment.  I accept the spirit and the letter of the motion and the reasons for which it was put.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I have listened to the debate last night and today and, to be honest, I found it useful and a number of the suggestions were quite helpful.  I would, perhaps, single out Deputy Finian McGrath for the measured response in his short contribution.  I also acknowledge the research done by Deputy O'Dowd and the commitment he has shown as regards the provision of care in nursing homes.  It is normal that the difficulties that arise in the system are those that are highlighted here.  We must be careful, however, not to frighten old people and indeed their families.  In my experience the majority of homes are well run and good care is provided.  Our job is to ensure that the highest standard of care is provided not just in the majority of homes but in all homes.The Government is firmly committed to developing and improving services for older people.  Last night, my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Brian Lenihan and Tim O'Malley, outlined to the House the unprecedented levels of investment specifically targeted at improving services for the older population and directed particularly at keeping older people at home.  I am happy to have the opportunity to respond to some of the issues raised in last night's debate and to update Deputies on the current position as regards the report on Leas Cross nursing home.Deputies will be aware that the HSE asked Professor Desmond O'Neill, a consultant geriatrician in Tallaght General Hospital, to write a report for it on the deaths of residents at Leas Cross.  The report, based on documents only, in line with the terms of reference agreed with the HSE, was submitted to it earlier this year.  At this stage before publication, it is not appropriate to go into details on either the contents of the report or the difficulties expressed by the HSE's legal advisers.  However, I can say that in general the concerns of the legal advisers cover the process used by Professor O'Neill in the drafting of the report and some of the conclusions.  The HSE is attempting to resolve the legal difficulties with Professor O'Neill.  Both the Minister for Health and Children and I want to see the report published as soon as possible and wish to have any remaining obstacles to its publication removed.  I emphasise that.  We can all learn from the report if it is published.  Difficulties exist and I hope they can be overcome.  I make the point again, however, that the HSE asked for the report.  I know a question was asked about the ownership of the report, but the point must be made that it was the HSE which commissioned it.

It is a difficult decision for any family to send a loved one to a nursing home.  When that decision is made, however, certain expectations are created.  The programme showed us that the inspection system at that time was not working properly.  The Taoiseach, the then Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and I gave a commitment in this House to bring in legislation to make the necessary changes to ensure that people who go into nursing homes are given a very high level of care.  We have made every effort to ensure that this happens and it will.On 31 May, following the television programme on Leas Cross, I wrote to Commissioner Noel Conroy asking him to determine whether there were issues involved that needed to be investigated by the Garda.  Some people have been very critical of the HSE and the fact that it has not published the report.  Some might feel the HSE is sitting on the report.  It must be remembered that it was the HSE which asked that the report be published.  We will make every effort to ensure that it is published.

The Chair has not given me much time today to say my few words.  I have listened to the full debate and I repeat that we gave commitments to the House.  As was outlined last night, legislation is being prepared in the Department to provide for the establishment on a statutory basis of the health information and quality authority, HIQA, and a social services inspectorate function as part of it.  That is a commitment which will be honoured.  Public consultation on the draft heads and the general scheme of a Bill providing for the establishment of the HIQA has been carried out.  Included in the scheme is provision for the establishment of an office of the chief inspector of social services with the HIQA.  The office of the chief inspector will be assigned responsibility for the inspection of residential services for older people, including private nursing homes.  We intend to seek Government approval as soon as possible to commence drafting the full Bill.  It is intended that the Bill will be published during the autumn session.I emphasise that we have shown commitment both in drafting the legislation and in providing funds for older people, which is very much a priority with them.  We shall ensure older people are given the type of care they deserve and that those who decide to open nursing homes will be obliged to give a high level of care to all their clients.  It is nothing more than they deserve and we will ensure this care is provided for them.

It has failed in its duty to legislate, it has failed in its duty to give political direction to the health services and it has persistently failed elderly patients in nursing homes.  Government representatives come into this Chamber and bleat about what they have done and what they will do, which is a shocking disgrace.  They do not have the manners to apologise to the patients who they have let down so badly.As I pointed out in my contribution before this, the owners of nursing homes had to publish their own set of standards because by waiting for this Government to do something, they would all get tainted with the same bad press as the minority of dangerous nursing homes.  Deputy O'Dowd spoke last night about inspections carried out by the HSE year after year.  What is the HSE's response?  We get a letter from Mr. Aidan Browne, national director of the primary community and the continuing care directorate, defending himself in the media.

One sentence in his letter to The Irish Times was quite interesting, “Your readers can be assured that the HSE will not tolerate nursing homes operating below acceptable standards”.  I would like to know where Mr. Browne has been for the last nine or ten years.  He must have been asleep, because he certainly is not reading the same reports we are discussing.  He continues by stating “where issues are identified for follow up action, they will be actively pursued”.  The owners of those bad nursing homes must have been shaking in their boots when they read that, because if the HSE could not do anything for the last 15 years, it certainly will not do anything about it now.  Legislators must ask who is protecting the patients.  That is the question the Minister of State should be answering.Fine Gael will bring forward proposals for a patient safety authority.  It will be mocked and jeered by Government representatives.  It will be dismissed by Ministers who have much to answer for regarding care of the elderly.  A patient safety authority is the only thing that will protect patients.  We need an overarching body that focuses on the patient.  The Medical Practitioners Act deals with doctors, the Pharmacy Act deals with pharmacists, the Nursing Act deals with nurses.  However, legislation that focuses completely on the patient is always put off for another year by the Minister for Health and Children.  What is another year when it comes to protecting the old people in our society?  All legislation that might make a difference to patients has been put on the long finger by the Tánaiste, such as eligibility legislation.  She has dismissed all legislation needed to protect patients.  We must all act on this issue, but this Government especially needs to do so.Most of the failure of the past nine years has had to do with quality of life issues and social services.  The Minister's record cannot stand up on this issue.  She can take action and follow our lead.  She can take advice from people like Deputy O'Dowd, who has made this a major issue in his political career.  She should not insult the elderly with the amendments the Government has made.  The major point on which she focused, the social services inspectorate, has been dismissed for another year.  That is the sort of attitude taken by this Government in the care of the elderly and it is a disgrace.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I welcome the opportunity to speak.  We must ensure that those who are most vulnerable, those who have contributed so much to society, namely, our parents, have the best services.  That is not the case currently.We recently received an opinion of counsel on Leas Cross nursing home and having read it, I see no reason that the report cannot be published.  The opinion expresses worries about a judicial review of the report if it is published.  Let there be a judicial review and let us test the system.  It should be published and we can see what happens.  The opinion exposes the total incompetence of the HSE in handling the issue.  The level of incompetence is unbelievable and I suggest the Minister tests the system and has that judicial review so we can allow this to be debated in full.I want to raise the issue of patients in psychiatric homes who are in need of attention.  The report of the health inspectorate for this year is extremely critical of the governance of psychiatric homes.  It expresses concern bordering on outrage about the treatment of patients, the control of the treatment, the disparity of treatment and the absolute need to bring some sort of order to the situation.  Some 22 years after recommendations were made to close unacceptable psychiatric hospitals, nothing has happened.  The sooner the Government recognises the urgency in dealing with generations of neglect in this area, the sooner something will be done.  We have had so many reports on this issue, as the Minister of State knows, including four recent reports on psychiatric services and suicide.  We need no more reports.  We need action and implementation of the reports.  We accept all the recommendations of the 133 reports made by the Department of Health and Children, but nothing is being done.  Many statements and commitments have been made since 2002, yet we are now in late 2006 and very little has taken place to ensure care for the elderly.I received complaints yesterday on the treatment of people in nursing homes.  We must have inspections of nursing homes that are not flagged in advance and that can take place at any hour of the day or night.  We have seen models of this in other countries, where very strict inspections occur without notice.  This ensures the services in these homes are up the required standards.  Given the record of the Government, one can understand that people do not believe statements that have been made over the years.  Given its repeated failures in this regard, people simply lack confidence that the Government can or will do anything.  Fine Gael policy will ensure, as will the joint policy to be developed by both parties, that people will be protected, their contribution to the State and their specific needs will be recognised and services that should be available to them will be available.Earlier, while attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I heard a statement regarding nursing home subventions.  In the course of the discussion on nursing homes, the urgent need to examine nursing home subvention levels was raised forcefully.  I ask the Minister of State to revisit the argument and to consider the points made repeatedly by several Members regarding the need to do so, given the pressures on many families to cater for their loved ones in nursing homes.  On 1 January, a raft of increases will be introduced in all nursing homes.  Perhaps they will be legitimate in most cases because of increased costs and so on.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this issue as part of his function.

There are issues that must be answered directly by way of responses to supplementary questions.  Therefore, a motion that did not make provision for Members of the House to ask the Taoiseach direct questions and get a reply to them is not acceptable.

A question and answer session is not provided for in this motion.  It provides for only five minute speaking slots and then we are expected to sit down and forget about this.  It is simply not acceptable.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	388	When I, on behalf of my party, made a formal request to the Government Chief Whip on Monday for such a debate to take place, it was on the basis that direct questions could be asked and direct answers given.  I expressed reservations that Leaders' Questions and the Order of Business were not suitable mechanisms for such questions and answers to take place.  Yesterday's performance showed that to be true, as did today's Order of Business when the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform refused to answer questions on this matter.  What is being offered to us now is not even half a horse.  This matter demands a longer debate and an opportunity for all in this House to ask the Taoiseach direct questions and for the Taoiseach, for once since this controversy has arisen, to give direct answers.

There is inadequate time for dealing with this matter and I believe the Taoiseach would welcome a question and answer session, in the first instance, to properly respond to the questions that clearly exist in the public domain and in this Chamber.  We should address this matter fully and the Minister of State should accede to the additional proposal.

As Members are aware, there are opportunities for those who can speak on Leaders' Questions to raise any question they wish under that procedure.  Members also have the option to raise this matter by way of Private Members' business.  Therefore, the proposal I put forward is the most reasonable one in these circumstances.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I welcome the opportunity to comment on this Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill.  I drafted this before the June recess and a number of developments have taken place in the debate over security since then.  I welcome the legislation and support the fight against crime, including terrorism, and improvements to the security of our people and our country.In the modern world, one is dealing with extraordinarily sophisticated communications, financial networks and ease of transport from one jurisdiction to another.  If crime is becoming globalised, we must also globalise the means of fighting it.  This Bill enables us to globalise our fight against crime through co-operating with other EU members states and is to be welcomed.  Before the summer there was justified concern over how crime trends were developing and since then there has been a debate on the need for EU member states to preserve their individual sovereignty in crime prosecution and prevention, which I supported.  While I am ad idem with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on mutual recognition of criminal law systems, we must preserve our independence in that area.  When the draft European constitution was being prepared several years ago, then Deputy John Bruton and I represented the Government on the working party that prepared some of this legislation.  Ireland, the UK and some of the new accession countries were in the minority in trying to emphasise the need to preserve our independence in this area.As has been pointed out, the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill gives effect to seven legal mutual assistance instruments.  It builds on an existing legislative framework for mutual legal assistance.  It provides for the effective co-operation between member states of the European Union and between states worldwide.  This is of increasing importance in recent times.  The case for mutual assistance in the provision of police activities is essential.  That goes back to the days when Interpol was established and the more recent development, albeit in restricted form, of Europol.  It is right that within a more unified Europe, where there is harmonisation within the legal framework, we should assist each other.  Criminals do not have regard for frontiers and boundaries but often regard them as a means to escape or delay detection.  If we were in doubt about how international crime is evolving, yesterday's hijacking of a private jet demonstrated it.  I compliment the international police forces led by the Garda Síochána on how they dealt with the incident and I look forward to successful prosecutions.As organised crime and terrorism become more sophisticated, it is essential that every technique and support is given to police across the Union to enable them to apprehend and bring to justice those responsible.  The Bill covers diverse areas such as accessing bank accounts in all EU states, collecting and transferring evidence, setting up joint investigation teams, producing prisoners to give evidence in other European jurisdictions and most importantly in the modern world, intercepting telecommunications across national boundaries.  It will cover telephone calls from mobiles and land lines, as well as e-mails and Internet connections.  Although there are concerns among certain groups about the latitude allowed by this and other legislation on the retention and preservation of records for significantly longer than some would like, we need to err on the side of caution.  While it may be possible to become less restrictive in the future, we are up against significant dark forces to whom we must respond strongly.  Monitoring bank accounts will make it easier for member states to confiscate the assets of criminals, especially those who live outside their jurisdictions.Much of the legislation will concern Irish citizens wanted for criminal offences who have fled the country to reside abroad.  This is important.  We should not tolerate what the tabloids call the "costa del crime".  Wherever people hide, whether elsewhere in Europe or further afield, they should be extraditable and their assets should be retrievable.  That will require an element of co-operation that did not exist heretofore.  It will require an element of mutual recognition of legislative bases that is not as developed as it might be.The Criminal Assets Bureau was enabled by legislation to put pressure on drug lords and their organisations and to take on the criminals and fight them effectively.  There have been many instances of the success of the Proceeds of Crime Act whereby the ill-gotten gains of these warlords have been confiscated.It may be necessary to look at the legislation underpinning the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Proceeds of Crime Act to see whether they need to be updated and made more rigorous in the light of experience.  I would welcome contributions from the law enforcement agencies on whether tighter legislation is necessary.  Even if they suggest this we do not have to adopt it but they are best placed to give us such indicators.  The legislation also forced many so-called astute drug barons out of the country, some from my constituency — Deputy Finian McGrath will identify with that experience.Unfortunately they found their way to sunnier climes in Spain and elsewhere from where they ply their trade and supply the Irish market.  Maybe because they are supplying the Irish market the authorities in the Mediterranean and northern European countries take little notice of them.  This is unfortunate.  I, Deputy Gregory and several others visited the drug enforcement agencies in Holland and elsewhere some years ago and impressed upon them the need to prosecute vigorously the obvious activities of some of the Irish drug barons who are still at large.  We need to continue that co-operation.The legislation helps to track down these individuals and confiscate their ill-gotten gains whether here or elsewhere.  This Bill will do likewise.  It identifies the main forms of mutual assistance, including sensible and practical arrangements such as the provision of financial information, access to bank accounts and making that information available on request with certain safeguards.  This is highly desirable.  We need to be careful about the safeguards to ensure that they are as tightly drawn as possible.I note that the Bill provides indemnity to financial institutions also, which is useful because we have seen how successfully the Criminal Assets Bureau operates by having access to the resources and assets of people who cannot be brought to justice for criminal offences but can be caught for related activities and evidence.  Everybody cites the case of Al Capone who was brought to justice in the United States for tax offences rather than for the offences for which people thought he should easily have been prosecuted.Another Criminal Assets Bureau method, the enforcement of orders for freezing property is a practical and sensible arrangement but it must apply, as far as possible, Europe-wide.  We have fairly incontrovertible evidence that many of those who make millions of euro here are making many millions more in other jurisdictions in the European Union and the accession countries.  While I welcome the news that Bulgaria and Romania are to accede to membership of the European Union next January, I am concerned about the obvious levels of corruption, especially police corruption, particularly in Bulgaria.  There is an onus on us to ensure that abuse of legal systems is stopped.  A fundamental tenet of membership of the European Union is that the rule of law prevails.  There can be no abdication from, or equivocation about, that.I welcome the provisions regarding the extension of joint investigation teams, particularly those involving co-operation with the United States.  I also welcome the co-operation between the police forces on both parts of this island.  There is now a high level of co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and the Garda Síochána.  That is an extremely welcome development, which is long overdue.  Since we last spoke on this issue we have seen action taken on criminal activity by paramilitary and criminal groups along the Border through co-operation between the Garda Síochána, the PSNI, the Assets Recovery Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau, and I want that to continue.There has historically been, and continues to be, a high level of co-operation between the United States and Ireland.  It is sensible to introduce joint investigation teams as part of our legal and policing co-operation.  Organised crime is very sophisticated and terrorism, which poses a major threat to society, must be tackled with the greatest diligence and global co-operation.  This is not the only way to tackle terrorism but is one that manifests itself regularly and obviously.I note also in the Bill that witnesses can be heard through video link or teleconferencing.  That was covered in other legislation and is sensible.  We need in the reform of the Garda Síochána to make greater use of video-linked evidence and teleconferencing.  The trial in respect of the Omagh bombing, running in Northern Ireland, is a good example of this because the victims can observe the proceedings of the court at a remote location when they choose.  The videotaping of evidence was introduced to eliminate the waste of Garda time.  It would be foolish not to avail of the technology, which facilitates the improvement of the prosecution and the delivery of evidence, especially when we are trying to make the best use possible of Garda time.I have spoken before on the need for our law enforcement agencies to be provided with the best equipment and technology in their fight against terrorism and organised crime.  I am pleased to see that since we last spoke here the contract for the digital system for the Garda Síochána has been placed and will be rolled out in the coming months.  That is acutely important.  While anecdotal information is not always the best, it is disturbing that there are times when the key people behind significant and abhorrent crimes arrive on the scene before the gardaí because they have more sophisticated communications technology.In 1988 when I first visited Dublin's sister city, San Jose, the limousine taking us from the airport broke down and we were taken to our hotel in police cars.  That was the first time I saw on-board computers being used.  Given the development of ICT, with Blackberries and hand-held units, it beggars belief that on-board computer information cannot be made available to the Garda.This legislation does much to combat drug gangs and drug crime.  I have often referred to the threat drugs pose to our communities.  I applaud the good work of the Garda in dealing with drug gangs, especially when we consider that so much crime evolves from direct involvement in drugs or from related activities.  My constituency has suffered from the emergence of people who have become very rich at the hands of others, to put it obliquely.  It must be a source of huge concern.  We regularly hear reports of young lads, who are obviously no angels, being arrested with large doses of drugs in their systems, to the extent that they need to be treated for drug overdoses.  It appears that cocaine is the new aspirin for many people who will do anything to manipulate those who are weaker than themselves.  We need to keep on top of the problem and this legislation will help to facilitate that.  I agree with Deputies who have argued that the drugs problem is not just a law and order issue.  We could talk about this aspect of the matter, which is clearly important, for a long time.  It is generally acknowledged that just 10% of the drugs coming into this country are detected.  Terrorists and drug gangs are co-operating with each other across jurisdictions.  This Bill, which enables mutual assistance between member states and allows authorities in another jurisdiction to share information on drugs coming into this country, enhances and supplements the national fight against drug gangs, as well as the existing international co-operation in the fight against organised crime.I welcome the safeguards which are built into the legislation whereby the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not need to accede to a request if it is based on specific grounds relating to sovereignty, security and other interests of the State.  As I said at the outset, I strongly support the stand taken by the Government at the Helsinki meeting of the Council of Ministers a number of weeks ago on the need for us to preserve unanimity on reaching decisions on this particular pillar of the European project.  This legislation also provides that the Minister does not need to accede if there are grounds to suspect that the request was made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing someone based on their sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, political opinion or sexual orientation.  These good precautions are in line with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I will add a cautionary note by reminding the House of the hard-hitting speeches which were made in our neighbouring jurisdiction over the summer by ministers there who lectured members of religious communities about their responsibilities and about what their followers might or might not get involved in.  It is not helpful to take such an approach to any particular religious community.I am glad the Minister has taken the views of the Irish Human Rights Commission into consideration in finalising the provisions of this legislation.  Civil liberties groups will always question issues in a Bill like this, and quite rightly so.  Unfortunately, the loss of certain personal freedoms and the threat to human rights are among the disadvantages we sometimes encounter when we try to take action against organised crime, drug barons, prostitution, child pornography, trafficking and terrorism.  Crime bosses and terrorists will always have an advantage in this regard.  It is important that we err on the side of being very cautious, which might upset some human rights groups.  It will probably be easier to relax the provisions of this Bill in years to come, after it has become law, rather than trying to tighten the situation after the horse has bolted.  Civilised society must balance the need to fight evil with the need to show respect for personal freedoms, civil liberties and human rights.  While that is not always easy, we must be vigilant.  We must draw a line in terms of what is acceptable to protect the freedoms we have.  We must also provide a safe and secure society for the people who live with those freedoms.  Ireland has a good record of protecting the rights of individuals, even during times of trouble.  We have made difficult decisions when dealing with terrorist activities on this island.  We have taken a position of leadership on the international stage at the same time, in areas like human rights, development aid, conflict resolution and peacekeeping.  We can provide leadership on the world stage by providing mutual assistance and offering information on how we have addressed problems like these.This necessary legislation will be welcomed by most fair-minded people.  Ireland is playing its part on the international stage by introducing it.  Mutual co-operation between criminal groups which use modern technology and business activities for selfish gains must be matched by equally co-operative legislative work, which is what we are doing in this case.  I welcome the legislation and thank the Minister for introducing it.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill 2005.  As Deputy Carey said, it is important that we should have a debate on this matter.  Like many fair-minded people, however, I will take a different position from the Deputy on the details of the legislation.  It is important for us to have a balanced debate and for Members to propose sensible ideas and solutions about crime, particularly international crime.Many citizens and residents of this State have significant concerns about what is going on in this country at present.  They are worried about crime, cocaine and shootings on our streets.  A constituent of mine, Ms Donna Cleary, was shot dead as a direct result of the drugs war on the north side of Dublin.  In recent days, people have been kidnapped and held hostage while money was taken from banks in my constituency.  It is all very well for some people, like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to take the high moral ground when speaking about the victims of these crimes, such as the staff of banks and their families.  I commend the staff of the bank in Killester, in particular, on the tough decisions they took in the interests of public safety.  They were hounded by certain Ministers and senior police officers in the days after the raid on that bank.  The key issue for many of the families in question is that nobody died and the other issues can be resolved at a future stage.  I commend the staff in Killester on their bravery and integrity in prioritising the human rights of our citizens.It is important to reflect on issues of international law as part of this debate.  It seems that international law is completely out of control at present.  Human rights are being abused by rogue states and presidents of so-called "free democracies", who are making things worse.  The pendulum has gone the other way — the international community has gone crazy.  We see nothing but abuse of human rights, rather than respect for them.  This is an important aspect of the debate on crime and the criminal justice system.  It is wrong that some elements of the right wing press in certain countries think that human rights and civil liberties are dirty words.  Those who do not understand that respect for human rights and civil liberties is an important part of our criminal justice system are making a fundamental mistake.  That is the line I will be taking in respect of this Bill.I have major concerns about some international states.  I spoke recently about the record of the United States on civil liberties and human rights.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should hammer home this point on behalf of the Government at every international meeting.  We should not be afraid.  We should have the bottle to side with other countries, particularly poorer countries, at United Nations level.  It is important for Ireland to work with other countries to promote international peace, to prevent the recurrence of circumstances like those in Darfur, to co-operate on the various important issues and to deal with the drug barons.  We should work with the poorer countries which need assistance, in particular.  We need to treat them with respect and dignity, but that is not happening at present.  Some of the so-called free democracies of the West are treating such countries with a lack of respect and dignity.I would like to highlight another aspect of this debate.  It is all very well to deal with the issue of mutual assistance on matters of criminal justice, as we are doing today, but we also need to be tough on the causes of crime.  Any Government, or any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that does not wake up and smell the coffee by being tough on the causes of crime needs to get a reality check.  It is unacceptable, in a very wealthy country, that everyone is looking the other way while communities are suffering massive and total social exclusion and major economic and social disadvantage.  We need to look at resources.  The excuse of not having resources is gone.  The debate on resources must now centre on how we distribute them to the communities concerned.  The poor, working class areas that need investment, housing and social inclusion policies must be the priority in this debate.  This is an important element in tackling crime.  The education system is another key and strategic element.  If young people, particularly those excluded from society, are assisted in their education, it will lead to a positive input in their lives and, in turn, prevent much crime.In tackling crime, we must face the reality that we need more judges.  Preliminary hearings should be held to shorten trials.  I want the establishment of a dedicated witness-victim-family liaison officer scheme.  Why can the courts not operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.?  A new criminal court complex for Dublin should be designed to segregate key players such as judges, witnesses, jury members, defendants and gardaí.  Most disadvantaged schools must be targeted with extra resources, particularly counselling and family therapy sessions.  I welcome the massive investment by Chuck Feeney, the Irish-American multimillionaire, in Dublin's northside.  He is working closely with the Department of Education and Science in targeting these resources.  I commend him and his organisation for the magnificent work they have done.We must face the reality that violent and disruptive young people require counselling and family therapy sessions.  These are the young people who will end up in Mountjoy Prison in the future if they are not attended to at a young age.  On a practical level, more community gardaí on the beat, talking and working with the people in reducing fear of crime are needed.  I support the development of Operation Anvil against armed gangs.  Some of those in the criminal drugs world can only be dealt with through such operations.  At the same time community gardaí are needed on the streets to prevent crime and deal with major issues.The purpose of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill is to give effect to provisions in seven mutual legal assistance instruments.  These are the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the member states of the European Union, the Second Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters; the mutual legal assistance aspects of the Council Decision concerning the signature of an agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters; the Council Framework Decision of 22 July 2003 on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing property or evidence; the agreement between the EU and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on the application of certain provisions of the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the 2001 Protocol.The new main forms of mutual assistance provided for in the Bill include the provision of financial information to other states for criminal investigation purposes regarding transactions on bank accounts and the monitoring of such accounts.  Mutual assistance will also provide for assistance in accordance with national law on the interception of telecommunications in the context of criminal investigation in EU member states and the hearing of witnesses and experts in other countries by video or telephone conference.  This co-operation will allow us to deal with serious criminal matters.A constant problem I encounter in my clinics is the number of assaults and attacks on people and communities suffering from anti-social and intimidatory behaviour that go unreported.  Anti-social behaviour is particularly relevant with young people aged 16 to 22 years.  Recently in my area, a group of women in a flats complex cleaned the stairways of dirt and syringes.  The following night they were intimidated by some gangs in the area.  It is unacceptable.  Those who clean up their complexes must be supported by the Garda and politicians.  This is not just a political issue but a human rights one.  It is about the human rights of the women in the Dublin North-Central constituency who have the bottle and courage to clean their stairways yet are intimidated by thugs involved in the drugs trade.We need quality police officers who are honest and have the trust of their local communities.  They must be seen to be in the community.  I challenge senior Garda management, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Ministers of State on this.  In an eight hour shift, how many hours do gardaí spend in the community, walking the streets?  They should be there for at least six hours.  One cannot blame younger gardaí if they are not in the communities they serve.  A culture is in place that must be tackled by management.  Many young men and women join the Garda with a vision of helping their communities.  Years into the job, they become cynical.  This concerns me and every Member is aware of this situation.Honest and quality policing is needed to tackle crime.  An example of good practice is where the community garda goes into certain areas at 11 o'clock on a Saturday night preventing assaults at chippers and pubs.  These are the gardaí who should be rewarded rather than the garda who is someone's hack in the job.  More respect must be shown to those community gardaí who prevent crime.  It is often said that it is not a good career move for a garda to be involved in the community, helping drug addicts and working with the health services.  It is better to be involved in the sexy sections of the garda.  I reject this because many community gardaí do much to prevent crime.There must be an emphasis on honesty, integrity and the trust of a community.  A garda cannot simply expect a community to respect or trust him or her.  If he or she is serious, that respect and trust must be earned.  I know that from working in Dublin's north inner city for 20 years.  The excellent gardaí, particularly those involved in the drugs squad, did not expect but earned the respect and support of the communities involved.  They turned around situations where there was cynicism and mistrust.  This approach is needed across the State.Bad police practice needs to be tackled.  On the night before the All-Ireland football final, a group of young women walking down O'Connell Street were intimidated by another group of young women with a knife, apparently high on drugs.  Fortunately, the women in the first group talked their way out of the situation.  When they rang the Garda, they were asked "what could the Garda do about it?"  They could not locate a garda on O'Connell Street.  One must question the competence of Garda management when, on the Saturday night before an all-Ireland final, young women are threatened with knives and there is no Garda back-up.It leads to a loss of confidence in the force when one hears stories such as this.  Garda management must wake up and smell the coffee, get its act together and deliver the necessary services.  It can no longer hide behind the numbers game because there are more gardaí than ever before in the history of the State.  What are the managers, including the Commissioner, doing?  These are fundamental questions.  The Garda must move beyond claiming its hands are tied.  That is utter rubbish.  One does the job to the best of one's ability whether one is a garda, fire officer, teacher, medical worker and so on.The Bill provides for the mutual recognition and enforcement of orders for freezing property based on evidence from other EU member states, obtaining identification evidence for criminal investigations both inside and outside the State, and the establishment of joint investigation teams in co-operation with the United States of America.  I have already mentioned my concerns about the human rights record of that country.  Co-operation is essential but we must be careful about working with persons who have no respect for human rights.The Bill includes provision of a legal basis for the restitution of articles obtained by criminal means to their rightful owner and for controlled deliveries in the State and participation in such deliveries in other EU and Council of Europe member states.  Provision is made in section 11 for the specification of different versions of a person's name when information about financial transactions is sought from a financial institution on the basis that it is not reasonable to expect the institution to be aware of variants of a name.A new section 28 has been inserted to provide for the interception of postal packets and telecommunications messages.  The Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 applies to interception orders made under the Bill, including the provision of that Act for review by the High Court of interception orders, including related documents.Section 87 has been amended to provide for specific regulations to give effect to an international instrument to be made under the provisions of this Bill.  This has been included on the advice of the Attorney General following a Supreme Court decision that a standard regulation making provision in an Act is not sufficient to make regulations giving effect to international instruments.These are the technical details of the legislation.  It is clear there are sections in the Bill that will strongly further facilitate the detection and prosecution of those responsible for transnational crime.  I agree with this simple objective but I have also pointed out the flaws.It is important that we wake up to reality by rejecting the common false perception that legislation will solve the crime problem.  That is not the case.  We must remind ourselves that legislation without action will not resolve the problem.  Some people in this House and others outside it seem to be obsessed with the notion that legislation will resolve everything.  Legislation is only a small, albeit important, tool in the fight against crime.The main issue is the necessity to deal with the causes of crime by facilitating and supporting those potentially at risk from a young age.  There must be economic investment in deprived areas.  There is no reason for it and it is unacceptable that there should be parts of Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway where people on one side of the road live in four bedroom houses with nice gardens and whose children go happily to school every day while only 500 metres away, families live in conditions of severe economic and social deprivation.We are deceiving ourselves if we believe it is adequate to debate crime legislation while ignoring the debate on our divided society.  We will get nowhere by doing that.  It is members of the poorest and weakest sections of society who end up in Mountjoy and Cloverhill prisons.  We must confront that truth.  We must support people even if that means making tough decisions and prioritising those most at risk by diverting resources from the wealthy.A news bulletin last night informed us that there is still €1 billion owed to the Revenue in outstanding and uncollected taxes from wealthy persons.  This is the official figure and one can only imagine the unofficial amount.  What would this €1 billion do for people in disadvantaged communities throughout the State?  The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley is aware of some of the estates to which I refer but I do not wish to name areas in my own or other constituencies.  People in such communities need our support and are looking for a break.  Recent events have shown the importance of that support.I welcome the opportunity to discuss this legislation but we must remember that legislation without action will not deal with crime.
#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I support and welcome the measures in this Bill.  Unfortunately, crime has become sophisticated and international — one could almost use the word "cultured".  As an island state, we cannot stand back and claim it does not concern us.The problems of crime have become matters of global concern.  An issue of particular concern in this State is the frightening and growing drug trade.  Some of these drugs are destined for use in Ireland while in other cases, we are used as a one-stop shop for the transportation of drugs to other parts of Europe and elsewhere.  Such activity seems to have increased.  Some days ago we heard of a consignment of heroin that was due to be landed at a private airport in Dublin.Despite the worrying statistics, this trade is not new for us.  I come from a part of Ireland where we do not have the same prevalence of drug abuse as that in the localities of other Members such as Deputy Gregory.  However, there is no village or town that does not have some problem with drug abuse.  My teenage children tell me one can buy an ecstasy tablet for €4 or €5 in my home town.  They are not available over the counter but nor are they particularly difficult to find.  It is a worrying reality.In west Cork, including Carbery's Hundred Isles, the hundreds of inlets that make up our sporadic and sprawling coastline were used for many years for the shipment of drugs, particularly from South America.  Our south-west coast lies in the path of the world's busiest shipping lanes.  We are aware of several success stories involving the interception of drugs off the coast.  In one instance, a considerable consignment was jettisoned off Kinsale, of which some was later recovered.I recently spoke to a retired customs and excise officer from the west who had intimate knowledge of border transactions and so on.  He recalled instances where he and his colleagues monitored the landing of drugs throughout west Cork.  I believe this still goes on.  A farmer who lives near a forlorn, lonesome pier on a headland told me some years ago that he was awoken one morning at 4 a.m. by the sound of the engines of boats, trucks and cars.  All this activity ceased before dawn.  These people were not landing herring or mackerel.  It is obvious there has been trans-shipment of drugs into Ireland.Unfortunately, criminal law, customs and Garda experts all tell us we are probably confiscating only some 15% of the drugs passing through the State.  That is a worrying statistic.  I laud the Garda Síochána in its efforts throughout the country, particularly Dublin.  In the past six or seven years substantial and valuable quantities of drugs have been confiscated.  The relevance to this Bill is that much of this success could not have occurred were it not for Interpol and international policing.The Garda Síochána has done an excellent job and it is regrettable that the drug issue will not be eliminated.  I wish there were zero tolerance but the drug problem in Ireland has grown in the past 25 or 30 years.  There are drugs gangs in Ireland today that are prepared to kill.  There was a very recent incident in Dublin where a Garda sergeant was shot by a 16 year old.  The car involved was driven by another 16 year old and, thankfully they were apprehended.  This young generation of criminals is audacious.  If I saw a garda when I was 16 I would have been inclined to walk the other way.  The statistics today are frightening and we must be vigilant.Not all drugs trafficked to Ireland come from South America.  North Africa, Eastern Europe and other places are involved.  These shipments may come by air or boat and it is worrying that they are normally accompanied by state of the art weapons and ammunition including machine guns and automatic pistols.  In this regard I welcome the gun amnesty and feel we must get tough on the possession of firearms without a licence.  I am not referring to farmers in the west of Ireland who may need a shotgun to protect their property.  There are many guns in cities and towns throughout the country.  Ten years ago the likelihood is they would have been connected to illegal organisations.  Nowadays weapons are added as a bonus to drug shipments of crack, cocaine, heroin, marijuana and so on.  This is a frightening aspect of the new criminal gangs that exist in Ireland.There are proposals relating to mutual legal assistance included in this Bill, but there are other areas in which it is of importance.  To track expert, sophisticated criminals it may be necessary for the Garda to intercept their communications by tapping phones and so on.  This is a grey area that touches on the right to privacy.  However, this Bill includes safeguards.  An application must be made to the Garda authorities to tap a phone line or intercept a communication that may contain information relating to criminals.  This application must be certified at the highest level, which is a good thing.Human trafficking has, regrettably, become an international issue.  In recent years Ireland has seen the trafficking of women for prostitution.  There have been horrific stories and, while it may not be widespread, it is a worrying trend that did not exist ten or 15 years ago.  The women are often tricked, bribed or cajoled to come here seeking a better lifestyle.  On arrival, in many instances, their passports are taken, they are hidden in houses and they are used, abused and ill treated.  Sometimes they do not see the light of day.  If this type of legislation, through co-operation with Interpol, the British police, American agencies and so on, led to such a woman gaining freedom and winning back her life it would serve a good purpose.We are aware that paedophile rings have been successful in trafficking children into countries such as Italy.  Thankfully this does not appear to be prevalent in Ireland.  These children may be infants bought in Eastern Europe for a few dollars and trafficked as part of the sex trade.  The boys and girls may be five or six years old up to 12 or 13.  In many instances they will have been used in paedophile images and films.  All human trafficking should be condemned, but we must be especially vigilant regarding children, the most vulnerable members of society.  Were it not for the international exchange of classified information, whether with the FBI, CIA or Interpol, crime in Ireland would be far worse.I recently watched a documentary on the events of 11 September 2001.  There was a breakdown in communication between the various security agencies in the United States.  The suicide bombers involved were living in the country in places like Los Angeles and San Diego.  One agency knew this and did not inform other agencies.  I do not wish to start an international argument with the United States, but had they been more vigilant and listened to repeated warnings from experts the twin towers would still stand.  That is a clear instance where information gleaned by international agents, working for the security of the United States of America, was not fed from one body to another.  The information was not correlated and what happened was appalling.  However, that is another day's work.In recent years, through legislation, this country has set out to achieve, in so far as possible, total co-operation within Europe.  Ireland is just one of 25 countries within the EU and it is essential that we have the highest quality of intelligence within the Garda Síochána.  The force has suffered recent setbacks with the Donegal and Abbeylara debacles, which were appalling, damaged morale and did no favours for the status of the Garda.  The Garda Representative Association also became political on the issue of policing and the reserve force.  However, despite those obvious setbacks, I have great faith in the Garda Síochána.  By and large, its members do an excellent job and enjoy good success across the board.I am fortunate to live in an area where there is not a lot of serious crime.  The most worrying serious crime that was committed in my constituency in the last 30 years was the murder of the French woman, Ms Sophie Toscan du Plantier, ten years ago.  That crime has not been solved but leaving that aside, there are problems from time to time in the area, but we are reasonably fortunate in terms of levels of serious crime.Members of the Garda Síochána should live within the communities they serve, particularly in rural areas.  There was an enormous furore recently in Dunmanway concerning the building of a new Garda station or the refurbishment of the existing premises, where there was an access problem.  The matter is still not fully resolved.  I have worked hard to find a resolution and am hopeful now because we have been given the orange light, if not the green light on the issue.  There are six gardaí in Dunmanway, all of whom are fine individuals.  However, somebody pointed out to me that none of them lives in the town.  Indeed, some of them travel 20 or 30 miles to work there.  I feel strongly that if a garda is stationed in a town or village for a number of years, he or she should live there.  I have heard complaints that if a superintendent or inspector is appointed in a rural area, he or she commutes 40 or 50 miles.  Perhaps such people are expecting further promotion, but they do not live in the community.  One cannot get a proper understanding of the problems in a town or village — I am using Dunmanway as an example and am not being disparaging about the town — unless one lives there.  When gardaí are living elsewhere it makes it difficult for them to provide the proper community policing that people deserve.  There is nothing nicer than walking through a town, for example, Bantry, on a Friday or Saturday at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. and seeing a squad car doing a tour of the town or a couple of garda officers walking around.  Perhaps I am old fashioned, but that type of presence gives a sense of security.This legislation must be welcomed.  There are many technical aspects to the Bill which have been dealt with by other speakers.  Some provisions have been dealt with by the courts, having been previously shot down as being ultra vires.  Regrettably, the legislation is necessary.  These issues must be dealt with and doubtless will still arise in ten years’ time, regardless of who is in Government.  Criminal justice is a fluid area.In the context of the European and global situation, the proposed European constitution, which is currently parked, is important.  I am chairman of the All Party Committee on the Constitution and hold the view that a European constitution will be very hard to impose on 25 different countries.  A constitution is the sole possession of a country.  Bunreacht na hÉireann, for example, is our exclusive possession.  Conventions or protocols can work but I have grave doubts about a European constitution being accepted by the Irish people in a referendum.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill 2005.  I am encouraged to speak more widely about the criminal justice system, given what I think is the appropriate philosophical tolerance that was given to Deputies who spoke earlier, and rightly so, as they are concerned about crime and the response to it in contemporary conditions.  Nevertheless, I will try to stay within the terms of the Bill.It would be a great pity if, in discussing this legislation or any other that emanates from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we were invited to make a distinction between human rights and good law.  Human rights is not soft law but is the bedrock of good law.  We should not be invited to make a choice between enforcement on the one hand and the protection of human rights on the other.  It is important to stress this point because there was a suggestion in some of the speeches that this Bill, along with others, is a sufficient response to contemporary conditions and that one can return to it, as it were, in better times.  This is not an appropriate view, frankly.  All temporary legislation of the criminal law kind is bad legislation in the end.  It may be justified at times in the name of emergency legislation but we have quite an inglorious record of allowing emergency legislation to exist for half a century or more.  One then wonders if one's normal condition is one of continuing emergency or one of being able to have law based on fundamental principles.I wish the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform well because it is responsible for approximately one third of the proposed legislative programme.  If one examines the recent proceedings in Geneva with regard to other legislation that will be required of the Department in such areas as the protection of the child, the Department will be even busier than heretofore.  The long list of unratified United Nations conventions, which the State has yet to legislate for also falls as a burden on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  All of this makes one wonder if sufficient resources are available to enable it to meet its legislative obligations.  Legislation is insufficient with regard to the protection of the child, as the Geneva meeting pointed out this week.As a former member of the McBride commission which examined Irish prisons, one of the sad aspects for me of speaking on this area is that referring to rights in prisons has become unfashionable.  It is perceived by many Members in this and the other House as unimportant.  There are no votes in it and thus it has become a matter of rights that can be let go.  The conditions in our prisons are a scandal.  We had the McBride report, although the commission was referred to as a self-appointed group by the Minister of Justice of the day.  It was succeeded by the Whitaker report.  We have been promised fundamental autonomous administration of the prisons but what is taking place is a scandal.  Where there is multiple occupancy, there is little control over drugs and there are few guarantees regarding personal health and very poor remedial programmes.  The suspension of work training programmes must also be considered and all these issues comprise the practical reason I say the conditions are a scandal.  It is also a kind of scandal that we are not able to have this discourse publicly because it is assumed this is a subject about which one should not speak.Deputy after Deputy spoke about the importance of having transparent, accountable and adequate policing in the community and they were correct in doing so.On the question of young people, the fact the juvenile liaison scheme did not enjoy sufficient status within the thinking of the Garda Síochána is a matter for concern.  At another time and in another way, I will raise the matter of an investigation into the terms according to which a scheme aimed at young offenders was suspended in my constituency more than a year ago.  An investigation was carried out into why this occurred and a report was prepared but we are now told by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it is not to be published.  This again demonstrates a scandalous lack of transparency.  I refer to the Bris project in the west side of Galway city.I notice very little concern, at public or departmental level, over the implications of large numbers of unaccompanied minors simply going missing after coming to Ireland.  I remember dealing with some of these young people, who were being allowed education but in the knowledge that as they prepared for the leaving certificate they qualified for consideration for deportation.  A number of the unaccompanied minors have gone missing and it would be useful if the Minister, in replying to this debate, outlined the procedures instituted to protect them.  The number of unaccompanied minors can be calculated simply on the basis of the number originally in the care of different health authorities.Let me turn specifically to the Bill.  With its nine parts and 89 sections, it raises a number of issues.  It is correct and appropriate to have mutual assistance in combating criminality.  It is sometimes not acknowledged by those advocates of globalisation that the real beneficiaries of the electronic age are those in the drugs industry and international finance, as is evident from Manuel Castell's three-volume work on the subject.  Money can be moved in real time and the speeds of movement of hot money and migrants have been entirely different.  This raises interesting international legal issues, such as the manner in which one responds to the fact the drugs industry and those who handle hot money are always ahead of the international enforcement agencies.Let me be positive and say I support such legislation as would enable the balance to be redressed in this regard.  However, I note the associated problem.  The views of those who seek from us our co-operation in bringing new legislation into being are entirely misplaced if they contend that because we suggest such legislation be crafted within the context of international law, we are somehow being tardy or less than full in our support.If one considers human rights law, which emerged particularly strongly from the end of the Second World War when it responded to the nadir to which human behaviour fell, and the international conventions, even those of the 1990s, to which we subscribe, one will note we are not talking about separate streams but about something which is very worthy, that is, the attempt to try to find universal principles to which people with different legal systems might subscribe and which, ultimately, might lead to some principles of universality.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform subscribes to some of what I am saying but regards the Irish Constitution as the boundary beyond which he will not go.  He is inclined occasionally to posit the superiority of constitutional protection over international legal protection.  This arises in one circumstance after another and there is no doubt it will be repeated when we come to consider the request being made that Ireland have adequate constitutional protection of the rights of the child.I can be specific in respect of different sections of this legislation and we can discuss them in detail on Committee Stage.  One section refers to the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  Last Monday week, a White Paper on overseas development aid was launched and it correctly makes the point that aid donors are anxious that their aid not be abused by corrupt recipients and so forth.  However, there is not a single line in the White Paper that commits Ireland to ratifying the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  It is in the legislative programme circulated this week and it is listed for 2007.The ideological argument people make about this matter is that one should get on with the business of ratifying these conventions.  In the speech introducing Second Stage of this legislation, it is assumed there is no great difficulty in preparing the necessary compliance legislation.  If this is the case, one must ask why there is a delay in ratifying the convention.  These matters will no doubt feature in the reply to this debate.The balance that I suggest should exist between the rights of the citizen and international legal co-operation and mutual assistance is very important.  In the later sections of this voluminous Bill, there is a reference to the Ireland-United States agreement.  Section 3 offers a definition of "torture" in which it is suggested it has the meaning given to it by the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act 2000.  I am not sure whether reference is made to the optional protocol.  We can consider this on Committee Stage.  It is very clear that in the United States, Senator McCain and others have made a very fine defence of the definition in the UN convention, but it is clear there is no agreement within the current Administration of the United States and the European Union regarding what constitutes torture.Reference is made in the Bill to the European Union-US agreement.  We must consider this on Committee Stage because it is not at all clear what has been agreed by way of final content in respect of international protections of the person.  There are issues of compatibility to be considered and they run far deeper than the textual references I have made.  I refer to entirely different systems from different streams of jurisprudence.  For example, the investigative procedures on the Continent regarding many different countries, whereby a person can be detained indefinitely without such guarantees as exist under the Irish Constitution, are obvious.It is very clear the relationship between mutual assistance and the system that prevails in Britain has been one of the black negatives in the record of outgoing Prime Minister Blair in that he and his Administration have systematically sought to erode the protections of rights under the European Convention.  A lay person considering this might ask the nature of that to which we are being required to give assent by mutual assistance.  Do they ask us to share intelligence with those who refuse to offer absolute guarantees under international conventions regarding the degrading or inhuman treatment of prisoners?  Do they ask us to share intelligence regarding matters of arbitrary detention without trial?  Regarding the drafting of this legislation, the concept of a judicial review of some sections was conceded under pressure in the Seanad.  We must be very careful how we approach this legislation.I say all that to be of assistance.  I hope we will eventually reach a point where we have restored the relationship between human rights and law.  It is deplorable that those who make human rights cases are somehow regarded as being soft on crime when nothing could be further from the truth.  What we want is something that precedes the human rights movement in law, namely, certainty.  We can have that when we have principles shared across different legal systems and states.I found it interesting that the last speaker from the Government side, Deputy O'Donovan, should suggest that he has almost an ideological difficulty with the concept of a constitution other than our own.  While its content is important, widespread acceptance of shared European — or universal — human rights principles would be very welcome.  That will be very difficult to achieve.  For example, regarding rights, does one argue for them based on a rational tradition regarded as the Western, post-Enlightenment system, or does one take into account the revealed source of human rights, which is the position in many Islamic countries?  I am aware of the difficulties in those debates, but human rights are not a concession.  They are at the very root of good law, domestically, at European level, and internationally.I need to say that because of we are in an atmosphere to which the Government spokesperson on Second Stage did not refer.  In international law, the principle of pre-emption has been accepted regarding, for example, the disciplines imposed by the United Nations in that one may play fast and loose with the notion of defence and reasonable preparation in anticipation of an attack.  The Bill defines such matters as extradition in section 2.  We have witnessed a period of the most widespread abuse through extraordinary rendition.We can go into this in detail on Committee Stage, but practically what I ask is why there are not prefatory statements before sections indicating that whatever is proposed will occur within the context of international law.  It is occasionally stated.  I believe that the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, in introducing Second Stage, referred to protections under the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, we need specific guarantees that regarding enabling provisions, the process, or the consequences of sections of this legislation being implemented there will not be any departure from full compliance.What is compliance?  That question arose in the questionnaire on extraordinary rendition sent by the Council of Europe to the Government.  We sent a very complete response, including all the enabling legislation, such as the Traffic Acts and Air Navigation and Transport Acts.  However, we did not give the Council of Europe perhaps the most important relevant information, namely, that while we had the Air Navigation and Transport Acts and other legislation, we had not exercised any enabling power thereunder.  On that matter, we were silent.We need certainty, and this legislation will have my support.  We should all co-operate and must not do anything that will tip the balance in favour of international criminals.  I listen to such people as Deputy Gregory and agree that there are armchair beneficiaries of the appalling drug trade.  I am in favour of taking action against those who visit such misery on communities, families and individuals, since a case can certainly be made for that.However, my other point is that we must achieve certainty by inserting into the text the fact that we operate within a framework of international law, particularly because of the abuse of intelligence systems.  We will revisit a real difficulty on Committee Stage regarding under what circumstances and to what degree it is appropriate to use an exchange of intelligence.  For example, what questions does one put to the requesting authority to allow the guarantees of which I speak?  It may well be that a Government or Minister must ultimately exercise discretion regarding where to strike the balance.  However, the principles on which a balance is sought should be absolutely clear.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I welcome this Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill 2005 and share the sentiments that Deputy Michael Higgins expressed in his contribution.I have only a few brief comments.  It is particularly appropriate that we should discuss mutual assistance among crime prevention departments in the EU and so on the day after a major operation in Belgium in which a privately owned jet from this country landed to pick up €10 million of heroin.  That type of operation, probably more than most other aspects of crime today, requires a great deal of the mutual assistance provided for in the Bill.In saying that, I congratulate the law enforcement authorities, Belgian and Irish, involved in taking that huge quantity of heroin out of circulation and ensuring that it does not cause the kind of misery to which Deputy Michael Higgins referred.  It is virtually unprecedented, although a few months ago there was a similar seizure of heroin worth €7 million in Ratoath, County Meath.  That probably demonstrates the changes in Afghanistan and the huge crop of heroin that has become available as a result.  It should come as no surprise to any of us that such vast quantities are heading to this State.  However, one can only imagine the human damage that such great amounts of the drug are causing here.The other aspect to yesterday's operation is the almost "Miami Vice" style international involvement and a private executive jet being used to collect the drugs and bring them back to this country.  That is how the international drugs trade operates and why law enforcement authorities have to be able to respond at that level.  They have to work together to stymie today's €1 billion drugs trade.  Having said that, there were a number of worrying aspects.  Apart altogether from the type of drug and the enormous quantity involved, it is quite incredible that the jet involved could fly out of an airfield in this country and return without anyone examining it to find out whether it had a cargo, who the passengers were or what they were bringing with them.  Yet it has been raised in this House in the past.  The Independent Deputy for the area in which Weston Aerodrome is based, Deputy Catherine Murphy, raised it within the last few months and tabled a Dáil question this week highlighting the fact that no customs, Garda or any other type of checks are carried out on private aerodromes such as Weston.  In the reply given to Deputy Catherine Murphy, the Minister for Finance, who has responsibility for the customs operations, acknowledged that there should be regular checks of Weston and similar aerodromes, particularly in the context of the international drugs trade.  Yet those regular checks are not being carried out.In 2005 a total of ten planned customs checks were carried out at Weston and six unplanned checks.  Those statistics were given by the Minister in replies to Deputy Murphy.  It seems extraordinary to me but apparently jets can land at Weston, the passengers can descend and get into a taxi.  They do not even go through the buildings in the place.  The buildings, of course, do not have planning permission in Weston, which is another worrying aspect.  The owners and those involved at Weston do not appear to have any regard whatever for the laws of this land.  That is the context.  There is a blatant flouting of the planning laws in this place and now jets are flying in and out.Presumably this was not the first occasion drugs were flown into this country.  It would be an enormous coincidence if that were the case.  The likelihood, however, is that it was not.  If people are running an aerodrome with no regard for the laws of the land and the State is failing in its responsibilities to ensure proper customs and Garda monitoring takes place at these aerodromes, it is inevitable that the type of operation that was being carried out yesterday will happen.  This issue has been addressed in the past in the House and has not been responded to in any positive way.  I hope, following yesterday's activity and the reality of what can happen in that type of situation, action will now be taken and that proper customs and Garda monitoring will take place as regards air traffic operations from this private aerodrome at Weston or any other.  If not, we might as well forget about the war on drugs or our attempts to deal with the importation of drugs into this State.I have a further question I want investigated.  I should like to see everybody involved or connected with that drugs operation yesterday thoroughly investigated by the Criminal Assets Bureau.  As regards the property or land associated with people who were involved in that operation, it should be clarified whether this was the first time a drugs consignment was found there.  The Criminal Assets Bureau has a major role to play in a follow-up of all of those connected with what could have been a disastrous drugs importation into the State.  Incidents such as that show the relevance and necessity for the type of legislation we are discussing.  However, there is little point in discussing legislation, ratifying conventions and involving ourselves in mutual assistance pacts if we do not take the basic steps on the ground to counter international drugs crime in this country.  It is very basic that aircraft cannot be allowed to fly in and out of the State with people unknown to anyone, checked by no one and carrying unexamined luggage.  That makes absolute nonsense of the term mutual assistance.  That said, I do not want to end on a negative note.The reality is that yesterday a consignment of heroin was seized by the Belgian law enforcement authorities.  That is to be lauded.  If the Irish national drugs unit was involved in any way in providing information that facilitated this to happen, it is to be congratulated.  However, we cannot gloss over the fact that the most basic steps are still not being taken in this State to prevent this type of international drug smuggling.  Of course it could involve all types of other smuggling as well.  I hope, however, this will be a wake-up call and that what happened yesterday will ensure steps are taken to prevent any recurrence.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not present in the Chamber.  He was in the Seanad earlier and I am sure he has a busy schedule.  I hope, however, that he will address these matters and that they will be brought to his attention.  I hope they will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance, who has responsibility for customs.  I hope my call for a thorough investigation by the Criminal Assets Bureau into all of those connected with the drugs importation yesterday will be acted on and carried out.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I thank Members for the constructive debate on this Bill and the suggestions made.It is a good thing that many Deputies have reacted in a positive way and share the view that this is an important Bill which will strengthen our hand in the fight against terrorism and transnational crime.  Effective co-operation between member states of the European Union and between states worldwide is of increased importance in recent times.  Organised criminal groups exploit modern-day phenomena such as globalisation, an increasingly border-free world and rapid technological advances in computers and communications.  Organised criminals have become increasingly sophisticated and regularly use international networks to carry out their activities.  Faced with this reality, organised crime can no longer be effectively tackled on a national level.  As Deputy Coveney noted in his remarks in June, crime does not respect borders.  In this context, it is important that Ireland takes its place on the international stage as a partner for mutual legal assistance purposes.Reference was made during the debate to the amendments to be brought forward on Committee Stage to give effect to the mutual assistance aspects of the UN Convention against Corruption and the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime.  The reason for this is that the advice of the Attorney General on the legislative measures required to give effect to the instruments was received since this Bill was published.  The Bill provides an ideal vehicle for dealing with mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, which are limited.Concerns were raised by Deputy Gerard Murphy and Deputy Catherine Murphy concerning the technological resources available to the Garda to implement this legislation.  It is intended that the Garda will have at its disposal the latest state-of-the-art information technology and telecommunications systems to compare with the most modern police forces throughout the world.  This is demonstrated by a significant increase in the information technology and communications budgets for this year.  The capital allocation for IT in 2006 is over €33 million, representing an increase of 18%, or over €5 million, compared to 2005.  There is a particular commitment to replace the current radio systems with a state-of-the-art digital radio system as quickly as possible.  The strength of the force on 7 September was 12,770, representing an increase of 2,068, or 19%, since June 1997.  The commitment to increase the strength of the Garda to 14,000 by the end of this year is fully on target.Deputy Howlin queried the enforceability of the provision in section 14(2)(b)(i) that material supplied in response to a request may not be used for any other purpose without prior consent.  This provision also features at section 60(5)(a).  In fact, it is nothing new and mirrors section 52(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, which has been in operation for some considerable time.  With regard to Deputy Howlin’s query on how the judicial oversight of interception authorisations would actually operate, I refer him to the provisions of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  Section 28 of this Bill merely extends the review provisions of section 8 of that Act to cover interception authorisations carried out under this Bill.  That review is generally retrospective and is carried out by a judge of the High Court.Questions have been raised about Parts 5 and 6 of the Bill.  In effect, they are a re-enactment of sections of Parts 3 and 7 and of the 1994 Act, with some amendments in the light of operational experience and they take account of the provisions in the instruments encompassed by the Bill.  Sections 51(3) and 52(2) provide for the written consent of the prisoner to the transfer to another state to give evidence or assist in investigations, and these are new provisions.  It is necessary to give effect to provisions in the 2000 convention and in the second additional protocol.  Provision for the taking of evidence by television and telephone link is also new.  Deputy Howlin also referred to the fact that "requesting authority" is not defined in Part 6.  He is correct, but a definition is not required here as section 2 of the Bill contains general definitions applicable throughout the Bill, and that section clearly defines "requesting authority".Deputy Howlin also mentioned sections 69 and 70, dealing with restitution.  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 deals in section 56 with restitution within the State only.  Section 69 of this Bill enables restitution orders to be made with respect to property in a designated state and section 70 makes this reciprocal.  In regard to the examples the Deputy used, restitution of property can only be made where there is a criminal conviction, and a court must order such restitution.  The Deputy raised a scenario of artifacts in an Irish museum allegedly stolen from their rightful owners by the Nazis.  In order for this section to operate in such a context, it would need to be proven that an offence had been committed and that the property had been obtained by criminal means.  It is not as simple as merely asking for objects to be returned.  The Deputy is correct, however, in his interpretation that no specific time limit is in place with regard to applications for restitution.  Article 8 of the 2000 convention and article 12 of the second additional protocol, on which this section is based, do not contain time limits.With regard to the Ireland-US Agreement, in addition to the Oireachtas scrutiny of this measure which has already taken place, motions under Articles 29.5 and 29.4.6 of the Constitution will be brought before this agreement can be ratified.  This will be done following enactment of this Bill.  Deputy Howlin also mentioned joint investigation teams.  Sections 3 and 4 of the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004 detail the circumstances in which a joint investigation team may be established.Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned the obligation to transpose EU instruments into law and noted that such instruments only come before the Houses following negotiation.  This has indeed been so in the case, but following the introduction of EU Oireachtas scrutiny measures, Oireachtas Members now have ample opportunity to examine proposed measures in advance and make inputs if they wish.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh made a suggestion that judicial oversight take place before interception of telecommunications messages is made.  However, this is not possible under the terms provided for in Article 20.2(b) of the 2000 convention or under the existing arrangements provided for in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to section 4, which empowers the Minister for Foreign Affairs to designate certain states.  The terms of section 4 are not new.  Precedent may be found in section 3 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 and section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  Deputy Murphy also queried certain provisions of the Ireland-US Agreement.  A resolution approving the terms of the Ireland-US Treaty to which she referred was passed by Dáil Éireann on 29 November 2001.In today's debate, Deputy Gregory spoke about the recent drug seizures.  As there are ongoing investigations, it is not appropriate to make comments here.  The full resources of the various enforcement agencies are being applied to the investigation.  Any lessons that can be learned will be taken on board and I agree with his comments about the extent to which these drug barons are prepared to go to get heroin into this country.  When we see the growth of heroin use in places like Galway, it is becoming a major source of concern.  There is a growth in heroin use, which has major social effects including an increase in crime, at a time when vast resources are being used to deal with the problem in Dublin.I assure Deputy Higgins the Bill is not temporary legislation.  It will build on existing mutual assistance co-operation and will enable us to comply with our international obligations.While the issue of unaccompanied minors comes under the remit of the Office of the Minister for Children under the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Health Service Executive, I will convey the Deputy's concerns to the Minister.  The Deputy mentioned the UN Convention against Corruption.  At present, its provisions are under examination in the Department to ascertain any further legislative requirements.Deputy Finian McGrath expressed concern on human rights.  The Irish Human Rights Commission received an early draft of the Bill for its consideration and responded in May 2005 with a number of recommendations.  The great majority of them required no amendments to the Bill, as the suggested changes had already been incorporated in the Bill during drafting.  A number of further amendments were included on foot of the Irish Human Rights Commission's recommendations.  As for the new criminal court complex, proposals are already under way within the Department in this respect.Unfortunately, during a Second Stage debate it is not possible to go into significant detail about all measures in a Bill, particularly in the case of one as lengthy as the proposed legislation.  Undoubtedly, detailed discussions on this legislative measure will take place on Committee Stage.  I again thank all Members who contributed to this debate and I commend the Bill to the House.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 5 together.The Government yesterday made a number of significant decisions that will provide a solid basis for expanded and improved bus services throughout the country over the coming years, while ensuring better value for money for both passengers and taxpayers.In the case of the greater Dublin area, there is a requirement for an expansion of the number of buses providing scheduled services.  This will require an increase in the total number of buses to approximately 1,800, under Transport 21, with a requirement for at least 200 extra buses over the next two years.  The Government has decided to meet this initial requirement by providing up to €30 million immediately to enable Dublin Bus to buy 100 additional buses for delivery over the period 2006-07 and by mandating the proposed Dublin Transport Authority, DTA, to procure the additional 100 buses from the private sector to provide services on new routes.The 100 buses procured from the private sector will form part of an initiative to facilitate the entry of new, private operators by awarding franchises to operate routes accounting for 15% exclusively to such operators by way of competitive tendering.  Following this period, all new routes will be subject to a competitive tendering process open to all operators.  The precise arrangements will be approved by Government on the basis of proposals from the DTA.  This approach will encourage new investment and innovation in the Dublin bus passenger market.In the interests of stability and integration of the bus network, the legislation establishing the DTA will allow the DTA to enter into a direct contract with Dublin Bus, in accordance with EU law, on the basis of its continuing to operate without a diminution in the size of its current bus fleet.  The DTA will also enter into contracts with other operators in the Dublin market.  All subvention payments, both to Dublin Bus and to new operators, will be made on an objective, transparent and even-handed basis to maximise value for public money.The integrated nature of the Dublin bus market will be underpinned through the DTA having responsibility for traffic management strategy, which will prioritise public transport, and for integrated ticketing, fares and information systems.  The DTA will also be empowered to organise the allocation of routes to operators in such a way as to maximise the prospect of efficient operation and the coherent development of the bus network.  It will also be responsible for monitoring the quality and cost of services by all operators and ensuring value for money on all routes.The Government has also decided to invest up to €50 million in Bus Éireann for the delivery of up to 160 buses in the period commencing in 2007 for non-commercial services outside of Dublin.As part of the Government decision, new legislation will be brought forward to replace the Road Transport Act 1932 by a modern regulatory and licensing regime in line with commitments in the programme for Government.  This will be designed in a manner consistent with EU law on public service obligations and State aids and in such a way as to create new opportunities and a level playing field for private operator involvement in the bus market.The combination of immediate investment in new bus capacity and structural reform to introduce competition and enhance incentives for efficiency represents a balanced strategy to benefit bus passengers and taxpayers alike.  It follows extensive consultation with interested parties and a study of mechanisms used internationally to achieve efficiency and effectiveness in bus markets.  The Government's strategy will deliver immediate benefits and secure steady and continuing progress into the future.The demand for bus services is set to grow substantially over the coming years.  Ongoing economic, population and employment growth, the growth of urban areas and the significant role of bus-based public transport in a sustainable transport system will all drive growth in the bus market.The Government's transport investment programme, Transport 21, has already recognised the critical role that an expanded bus service will have in meeting transport needs, including new and expanded feeder services to support a substantially expanded rail network.  In total the programme provides approximately €770 million for upgrading bus services, with €530 million being provided for the greater Dublin area and €240 million for the rest of the country.  The Government has now taken significant steps towards delivering on its commitment.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I did not absorb the whole of the Minister's reply but I welcome the fact that some sort of a decision appears to have been made.  Is the Minister aware of how bad the transport situation has become in Dublin in recent months, particularly since early September when the schools reopened and the full impact of the upgrade to the M50 made itself felt?  The impact of 100 buses on that situation will be minuscule.  A major input of buses is now required.I take it that the money being made available will provide 100 additional buses.  The Scott Wilson report, prepared for Dublin Bus five years ago, estimated that by this year an additional 500 buses would be required but none has been provided, which illustrates how far behind schedule we are.I am not clear about what has been agreed with the Progressive Democrats on competition and the involvement of the private sector.  I understood from the Minister's reply that 15% of new routes would be put out to tender.  Is that correct?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	400	They will be exclusively available for the private sector and there will be a tendering process for them.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	409	That is very disappointing in the context of the volume and extra capacity required in Dublin.  I welcome the fact that there are to be some improvements.  Can the Minister let us know when these buses will come on stream?  I know the Ryder Cup buses are available.  Does the Minister agree that they must be targeted in the vicinity of the M50, to bring people who live on the far side of that road into the city?  It has become unbearable for people living on either side of the M50.  It was supposed to liberate us but the M50 has become like a wall, imprisoning people inside and outside it.  In my constituency I can travel right around all the new communities on the north side, such as those who use the Navan Road, and they now experience appalling delays, not just on the M50, its approach roads and slip roads but in trying to get in and out of estates, which they cannot do because the traffic has become so bad.It is necessary to target new buses not at existing routes but at new routes, because it is very important that those people can get into Dublin city.  I am sure the Minister is aware we are facing another five years of traffic chaos with the M50 upgrade and something has to be done as a matter of urgency.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I am pleased that, after many discussions with stakeholders, both in the public and private sectors, the proposals on which I was working met with favour in Government.  This is an evolutionary approach to a planned opening up of the market and is in line with EU competition law.I have already conveyed the need for Dublin Bus to provide an additional 100 buses into the market in Dublin.  Dublin Bus is responsible for its own day-to-day operations but I and others in the House have articulated the need for as many buses to come on stream as quickly as possible.  We also want to provide 100 extra buses to the private sector, as additional buses are required, particularly on the periphery of the city, as the Deputy made clear.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	411	Is the Minister to give 100 buses to the private sector?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	412	We will support the entire pool of buses for subvented routes, as provided for in Transport 21, because subvention is involved.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Does the Minister mean capital subvention?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	414	We will wait for proposals to come forward but I am not averse to it.  The immediate requirement, however, as indicated by Dublin Bus network planning, was for 100 buses, which it has now received.  It is often forgotten by people looking purely at the numbers in the present fleet that the capacity has increased by 40%, owing to a change in the type of buses the company uses.  One cannot simply compare numbers with numbers — capacity is important.I agree, as I set out in Transport 21, that the bus market and the role of the bus fleet in the public transport network is fundamental and crucial to the delivery of public transport, not just in Dublin but around the country.  That is why I am providing such substantial moneys through Transport 21 for both Dublin and the rural market.  I have also met Bus Éireann's requirement for 160 new buses.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I trust the Chair will give ten minutes to my question.  I asked the Minister if it is still Government policy to encourage people from private to public transport.  There is no evidence that it is.  Between 2001 and this year only 20 buses were provided in the Dublin area.  As I have often said to the Minister, on Westmoreland Street every evening one can see hundreds, if not thousands, of people being refused access to buses because the number of buses is inadequate.  The Minister has mentioned various figures today.  Under the NDP, by the end of this year he is supposed to have provided Dublin Bus with 183 additional buses.  They are still owed to Dublin Bus.  The Minister tried to long-finger this over the past 18 months.  He asked for and received a review early this year and was told Dublin Bus could provide the services required to meet demand if it received an extra 200 buses.  The Minister has said he will authorise 100 buses.  Can he clarify what he intends regarding the other 100 buses Dublin Bus says it requires?It is cold comfort to those who live close to the quality bus corridors, which were recently provided at great inconvenience to drivers and considerable expense, to see that there is not a single bus on them.  This is intolerable and the Minister should be ashamed of it.  There is an urgent need for buses to be provided on those QBCs and to enhance the number of buses on existing routes, as the queues at any bus stop morning and evening will demonstrate.  Will the Minister explain his proposals on the second batch of 100 buses?  These buses are overdue.Will the Minister also explain what regulation he plans?  He is about to dismantle a good, integrated and co-ordinated network that encompasses a degree of expertise on the wider Dublin area's bus needs.  There is a danger that if the Minister dismantles that he will appoint a new regulator who will know nothing about the area and will not have the expertise, and it could take a number of years to recover and return to the current position.  Will the Minister confirm that Dublin Bus will still manage the overall network?  It is a specialised area in which there is limited expertise.

There seems to be some confusion on her part.  Some 22 million people use the Luas each year.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The key figure of the Government's record is that capacity has increased by 40%.  I agree with Deputy Shortall that more buses were promised that were not delivered.  According to Dublin Bus official figures the volume of bus passengers in this city decreased last year while transport numbers increased by 80%.  Is that not an example of the incompetent manner in which the Government has managed our transport system?  Bus passenger numbers decreased at a time when we needed to switch people to buses and they were queuing at the stops, as Deputy Shortall said.I have three questions for the Minister.  Why, in August 2000, were we able to produce a report on a new institutional regulatory framework for public transport, page 19 of which recommends that within a year we would establish a regulatory authority to do exactly what the Minister has committed to do today?  It was promised six years ago.  What happened six years ago to prevent that from being implemented?  What has been happening over the past five years as that sat on the shelf and Dublin passengers stood on the side of the road?The new regulator should be given the full strategic role of designing the bus network in this city.  It needs to be radically changed.  We need to leave the 1950s and enter the 21st century.  We require a mesh of bus services and new routes, not just in the expanding communities of which Deputy Mitchell spoke, but in existing areas.  In my area the 75, 17 and 18 orbital bus routes do not work.  One never knows when the buses are coming and they go all around the world.  We need new orbital bus services to replace those services and provide fast frequency services.  Will the regulator be able to regulate the routes and design the network for Dublin Bus routes as well as the private ones?I am still uncertain of the Minister's meaning.  If only 15% of the new routes are to be opened and 100 buses made available to the private sector, the Progressive Democrats have obviously caved in.  I would like the Minister to explain it in more detail.  What roll-out to the private sector does the Minister envisage?  Will it apply only to new routes?  Will the changes consist only of new private sector routes tagged onto the existing network or does the Minister plan a comprehensive review of the Dublin bus service?  A comprehensive review is needed.

They form part of an immediate guarantee ring-fenced for the private sector so that it can get a strong foothold in the market.  In respect of regulation, the Dublin Transport Authority will discuss with Dublin Bus and the various operators how the network is working in Dublin and throughout the greater Dublin area.  There is a need for many new services on the orbital routes and interconnectivity both with other modes of transport and the city.It is proper not to dismantle a network that works.  We are trying to add capacity and work within EU competition law and the EU directives to ensure that we achieve a modern regulatory framework that brings competition into the market and opens the market in a measured way, unlike the big bang approach taken in other countries, following which whole systems collapsed.

The DTA will work with Dublin Bus and the private operators in expanding the route and maximising the public transport system, the bus networks, to the benefit of the customer.  That is what we want to see.  I think that is what the Deputy is saying.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I am aware that parking problems arise on the roads in the environs of stadia such as Croke Park on match and other event days when a large influx of motorists from outside the area park on residential roads for the duration of the events.An examination in my Department of the present road traffic legislative provisions indicates that there is no legislative provision to reserve parking on a specified public road on specified dates exclusively to the persons who reside in premises on that road and their guests, as mooted in respect of residential roads that are outside the cordon area put in place by the Garda Síochána in respect of the streets in the immediate vicinity of the Croke Park stadium.The call to reserve parking to local residents is a complex matter.  It has also been drawn to my attention that inconvenience can also be experienced by residents where parking congestion can arise daily on public roads in residential areas in other circumstances countrywide, such as, for example, where day-long parking is availed of by commuters or persons who work nearby.My Department is examining the regulatory road traffic legislative provisions available to road authorities when applying restrictions and prohibitions on the parking of vehicles to ascertain if new measures to reserve parking to local residents in any circumstances are appropriate or feasible.  The issue has been referred to the Office of the Attorney General and when advice is received, I intend to commence a full public consultation process on the issue.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I thank the Minister for his reply.  He refers to parking problems around Croke Park.  Does he appreciate the seriousness of the issue for the communities in that area?  They are closed off and shut down on major event or match days in Croke Park.  People cannot get access to their homes.  This is in dramatic contrast to the clinical traffic management witnessed around the K Club for the recent golfing event there.  There is absolute chaos around Croke Park and the residents are the main victims.I welcome the Minister's remarks and acknowledge that there are other circumstances in other urban areas where residents are demanding residents only parking because of commuter traffic and so on.  This is a major issue for people in the cities.  Can the Minister give us a timeframe for the process he is putting in place?  How long does he envisage that this will be with the Attorney General?  It is some months since the Minister indicated in a written reply to me that the matter was going to the Attorney General and it is still with him.  Will the Minister give some sort of timeframe and say whether he is committed to trying to address this issue in the public consultation process to which he refers?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I agree with the Deputy who knows that I met a delegation of which I think he was part, when Councillor Fitzpatrick brought a group to me.  I accept that there is a problem but neither I nor any Minister of the day could legislate nationally for one stadium.  The issue arises in Thurles and other grounds throughout the country.  We must therefore consider it comprehensively.  It is with the Office of the Attorney General.  My officials and officials in his office have been working on this.  I did not want to proceed with the public consultation process without some legal basis for what we should do, and then fit a policy objective into it.  I am anxious to get a result quickly and set up a public consultation process because there are many different views that people want to express on this.I know Croke Park and go there regularly, not that Waterford reaches many finals but we have at least got as far as some all-Ireland semi-finals in recent years.  It is difficult for the residents in the area as in other places.  As soon as I get a response on the area with which I can deal, I will hold a public consultation process.  I will place a time limit on that which will be helpful to everybody.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The Government's ports policy statement, which I launched early last year, aims to equip the port sector and its stakeholders better to meet national and regional capacity and service needs.  One of the key challenges that lie ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, especially for unitised trade, lo-lo and ro-ro.  The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner.As part of this process, my Department appointed in September 2005 a firm of consultants expert in this field, Fisher Associates, to help determine whether the anticipated capacity requirement to 2014 and beyond can be efficiently and adequately met through the successful advancement and implementation by the port sector of some combination of the various proposals under development in the sector.Detailed submissions outlining proposals for new capacity for unitised trade were received from the following ports and evaluated by Fisher Associates: Cork, Greenore, Dublin, Drogheda, Rosslare, Shannon Foynes and Waterford.  The final report of Fisher Associates was completed in June 2006 and the Government noted its conclusions in July 2006.  It is intended to publish the broad conclusions of the report in an information paper shortly, which will be available on my Department's website at www.transport.ie.In summary, the study concludes that there is significant available capacity for lo-lo traffic at Irish ports.  Available capacity for ro-ro traffic also exists, although less so than in the case of lo-lo.  The conclusions of the study clearly demonstrate that the projects being progressed by the ports sector have the potential to deliver adequate capacity, in line with the Government's ports policy.I assure the Deputy that my Department will closely monitor the progress of these proposals, and for its part will certainly do what is necessary to ensure the statutory and other corporate governance requirements are dealt with expeditiously.  If there is a sound business case for these projects, the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance, as shareholders in the State-owned port companies, will be positively disposed towards them.While the Government, as shareholder and policymaker, has a clear interest in ensuring the provision of adequate, cost-effective port capacity, the development of the necessary capital projects is primarily a matter for the individual port companies and their boards.  This is in line with the commercial mandate given to the port companies under the Harbours Act 1996.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I am well aware these investments have to stand up commercially.  It is up to the ports to make the investments.  However, the Minister for Transport is responsible for making broad strategic decisions about where capacity will be provided.  When the Minister spoke earlier about buses, he said he was great at making decisions and that we would be hopeless at making decisions.  He is the world's greatest ever procrastinator.  The reality is that decisions on port capacity and, in particular, container capacity in ports have been postponed indefinitely.  Many reports and policy statements have been published, but no policies have been outlined.  Policy frameworks have been promised and the Fisher report has been completed, but no decisions have been taken.  As a result, no strategic direction for the ports has been indicated.  Is the Minister aware that the growth in capacity requirement that was originally envisaged by the Government is just half the level of growth that is anticipated by IBEC?  When will the Minister make some kind of strategic direction known?  Putting something on a website is not the same as making a policy decision or taking the kind of proactive position that is expected of the Government.  The Minister and Ministers of State in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who have joined the Taoiseach on many occasions when he has gone around the world to tout for trade, are aware that our ports cannot accommodate an increased level of trade.

I am making a political point when I say that.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I am not disputing the success of the economy.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The most objective observers are suggesting we will continue to enjoy growth of between 5% and 6% in each of the next few years.  There will be a long lead-in time because it is not possible to provide additional capacity in the short term.  For that reason, I launched the ports policy statement in January 2005, when I was Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  I appointed Fisher Associates to compile a report shortly thereafter.  We have been proactive.  The Fisher report was cleared by the Cabinet in July — this is the end of September.  I am taking the opportunity to meet representatives of the Irish Ports Authority at its meeting in Galway tomorrow.  I will pursue this matter even further at that forum.  As we speak, a number of ports are making progress.  The various ports, including those in Dublin and Waterford, are at different stages.  The purpose of this process is to establish what is required and how it can be delivered.  I have been impressed with the ports.  I believe they can provide additional capacity from their own resources.  As I have said previously, if it is necessary for the ports to sell non-core assets, they can do so.  The State might be in a position to assist them in exceptional circumstances.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The Minister of State has been proactive in commissioning reports, but he has not been proactive in making decisions.  Will the Minister of State make a strategic decision?  Will he give strategic direction to the ports?  Will he outline where he thinks capacity should be provided?  Will he ensure capacity is provided in a way that could integrate with our rail freight policy, if we had a rail freight policy?

I will discuss this matter with the Minister, Deputy Cullen.  After they have made their decisions and issued their recommendations, we will certainly co-operate with them to ensure the additional capacity can be provided.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10 and 103 together.In December 2000, the transport sector of the North-South Ministerial Council approved a programme for enhancing North-South co-operation on road safety.  The council agreed that joint road safety campaigns would continue to be promoted by the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and the National Safety Council in this jurisdiction, with one such campaign envisaged each year.  Joint road safety awareness campaigns are particularly suitable for North-South co-operation.  They generate economies of scale in terms of production costs and television and other media exposure.  The Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and the National Safety Council have well-established co-operation arrangements in this area.  Nine joint advertising campaigns have been developed by the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and the National Safety Council since 1999.  The campaigns have targeted speeding, seat belt wearing, drink driving, vulnerable road users, motorbike safety, driver and pedestrian inattention and child safety.The Road Safety Authority has taken responsibility for road safety advertising and promotion.  It will continue to co-operate with the Northern Irish authorities in the area of road safety.  A further joint campaign relating to child safety and seat belt wearing will be launched in Belfast on 3 October next.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, will attend the launch of the joint safety campaign on Monday.  The issues of driver disqualification and offences which attract a lesser penalty are being dealt with at two levels.  A framework for the mutual recognition of driver disqualifications is contained in the EU convention on driving disqualifications, 98/C216/01.  The convention relates to disqualifications arising from a range of specified traffic offences including drink driving, speeding and dangerous driving.  Irish legislation to support the application of the convention is contained in the Road Traffic Act 2002.In advance of the convention fully coming into force and following a ministerial meeting of the transport sectoral group of the British-Irish Council on 9 February 2006, I have formally agreed with the UK junior transport minister to enter into bilateral arrangements on the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications, as envisaged in the EU convention.  The UK junior minister wrote to me recently to advise me that the UK and Northern Ireland authorities are working to complete the necessary legislative and consultative processes to enable mutual recognition to be in place by April 2007.  The various officials are continuing to work to ensure the necessary administrative arrangements are in place to enable the relevant administrations to recognise and take action on driving disqualifications occurring in the other jurisdiction.In relation to lesser offences, the North-South work programme, as agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council, includes a commitment to examine the mutual recognition of penalty points between the Republic of Ireland and the North.  Not only do separate penalty point systems operate in the two jurisdictions on this island, but the system that operates in Northern Ireland also differs from that applying in Great Britain.  Therefore, it was agreed that it would be more appropriate to pursue the question of mutual recognition of penalty points on the basis of the operation of the three systems and that it would be more appropriate to deal with it under the auspices of the British-Irish Council.  As Northern Ireland has the lead role for transport matters in the council, the authorities in that jurisdiction are taking the lead in considering this issue.  It was agreed at the British-Irish Council meeting on 9 February last that officials should examine the prospects for greater co-operation in the treatment of road traffic infringements where the penalty falls short of disqualification.  Arising from the work in this area, I have agreed with the UK junior transport minister the terms of reference which have been proposed for a study of the feasibility of greater co-operation between us on lesser road traffic infringements, with a view to our officials undertaking a study on that basis and reporting back to us next year.

The television campaigns that have been promoted by the two road authorities in Ireland to date have been welcome, hard-hitting and quite effective.  Road safety goes beyond that, however.  Does the Minister agree there is a need to consider the harmonisation of road signs, speed limits, driver education and testing and, as he mentioned, penalty points?  Does he agree there is a need to accelerate the recognition of penalty points in the form he outlined?  Is there an indicative timeframe for when that will come about?  I refer not only to offences which attract penalty points, but also to offences which attract penalties which are less serious than disqualification.  Can the Minister indicate when the EU convention on disqualifications will come into effect?  He mentioned that he hopes the bilateral agreement will come into effect within a few months.  Has any work been done on different road surfaces and signals?  It would be practical and effective to introduce measures in respect of a number of different aspects of road safety.  All of us on the island of Ireland should benefit from the exact same road safety campaigns, speed limits, road signs and driver testing procedures.  We could even bring the criteria used to test cars in our national car test and the test offered by the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland into line with each other.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	470	The convention will come into place when all signatory member states have ratified it.  It allows for member states to move ahead with bilateral arrangements if the opportunity presents itself as it did to us and the Northern Ireland authorities.  This was discussed at a recent British-Irish Council meeting and several Ministers agreed with it.  We have also been to the fore at European level in the recognition of these issues, particularly the recognition of penalty points on a European basis.  It is the logical way to go and will provide the best results for road safety.In this jurisdiction many advances have been made in the past two years with road and signage quality.  Similar road signage and so on would be helpful to all drivers on the island.  Currently it is difficult for drivers coming from Northern Ireland into the Republic and vice versa.  Road safety strikes me as an issue that could be dealt with on an all-island basis.  It would have a good impact on road safety for the benefit of all drivers.We have moved with our counterparts in Northern Ireland on a bilateral arrangement.  There are, however, three different systems between the jurisdictions.  It was agreed that the best method would be to have a harmonised approach rather than matching one system up with another and unscrambling an existing one.  The Northern Ireland Office is the lead party in the British-Irish Council on this and it is working through a system.  It keeps in touch with departmental officials and has a timeframe to report back early next year at the next British-Irish Council meeting.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I welcome such co-operation and joint road safety awareness campaigns.  I hope we will move towards an all-island road safety strategy.  My principal concern is with penalty points.  I do not under-estimate the difficulty in co-ordinating the two systems.  Much time, however, has been lost.  If we are to move on a trilateral or a Europe-wide basis, it will take forever.  The urgency is in respect of Northern Ireland and the South.  One only has to drive on the M1 to see what is happening.  Invariably, cars that overtake on the M1 at enormous speeds are northern registered cars and similarly, on the northern side of the Border, southern registered cars have no regard for speed limits.  The accident statistics will bear that out in the northern regions.  There is a definite urgency in reaching agreement on mutual recognition of penalty points between Northern Ireland and the South.  Will the Minister consider fast-tracking this?  If we are looking to the rest of Europe to move with us, it will take for ever.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I do not disagree with the Deputy.  That is why we have moved ahead of the European level.  I have raised this matter at the EU transport meetings.  It is not a question of some countries being more committed than others.  However, getting a harmonised system in place is a formidable challenge.  Because of that, we felt our immediate target should be on the island of Ireland.  That is why I moved with my Northern Ireland counterparts on this.  I am only one party involved in this process.  The feedback was that it would have to be done on a UK-Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland basis.The Deputy correctly identified that it will be a longer process at European level.  However, we have forced the pace in moving ahead.  The primary objective is the island of Ireland result.  We have in place the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications, which is a major step.  When that is properly functioning, the penalty points issue should be resolved.  I want one system of penalty points on the island of Ireland and the laws between the two jurisdictions to be harmonised to reflect this.  Road safety and issues of that matter lend themselves to an all-island approach.  The appetite is there for progress on the matter but one has to tread at a certain pace in these matters.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	473	Substantial work was undertaken by the Department of Transport in preparing input for the energy Green Paper that will be published by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources shortly.  As set out in the Department's statement of strategy 2005 to 2007, a key objective is to secure a sustainable transport network that balances economic, social and environmental considerations.  We are mindful, in particular, of the need to reduce the energy intensity of the transport sector.With regard to long term-energy demand forecasts for the transport sector, Sustainable Energy Ireland prepares forecasts for energy trends.  It recently published a report, Energy in Ireland 1990-2004 — Trends, Issues, Forecasts and Indicators, which developed forecasts for energy demand in all sectors including the transport sector up to 2020.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	474	That reply tells me nothing.  It tells me what Sustainable Energy Ireland has done but nothing of the Minister's views.  The report by Sustainable Energy Ireland on energy and transport paints a bleak picture for Ireland in a world where oil is getting more expensive and carbon emissions must be reduced.  Our energy use has increased by 150% in the past 15 years.  Last year it increased by 8%.  Road freight has gone through the roof.  Not surprisingly under the Minister's management, rail freight has disappeared.We are facing two major political challenges.  Global oil production is about to peak, making it increasingly difficult for Ireland, one of the most oil dependent countries in the world.  We have a moral obligation to tackle climate change.  This requires radical cuts in emissions.  The fastest growing sector for emissions is transport.  What are the Minister's long-term plans to cut those emissions and reduce our use of oil?  Future generations will look back and ask what were we doing.  Were we asleep?  Did we read the signs and not plan for the long term?Why are we not cutting oil use and transport emissions?  Our current policies are heading in the wrong direction.  This year, not one public transport project will be opened.  Instead, the Minister will cut the opening ribbons on a dozen roads.  How will we reduce the 8% annual increase in oil use when oil prices are doubling?  The Minister's reply gave me nothing in this regard.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	477	The Deputy presents all the advances made in the economy as negative.  The answers to some of his questions are issues of which we should be proud.  For example, our employment numbers have doubled from 1 million to 2 million people and prosperity has come with that.  Ireland has one of the most modern, efficient and open economies in the world.  Demand for our goods and services has gone through the roof.  I will not deny this has placed a heavy burden on our transport system.  Ireland, like many other countries, is grappling with the global impact of energy costs on transport and emissions.  However, there are no simple solutions to this.In Transport 21, I did not present a "more roads" solution for Dublin and other areas.  I presented a €16 billion investment in public transport, a large commitment to getting people out of their cars with a resulting impact on vehicle emissions.  There is clearly a major onus on manufacturers in this regard and some of them are beginning to make serious advancements in terms of better use of fuel economies in cars, lorries, trucks and even buses.  As part of our energy policy, I intend that some of the new buses that will shortly begin to come on stream will be more fuel efficient vehicles in terms of the energy sources they use.The Government has enormous commitment to energy efficiency.  As a former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I understand the issues involved and our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.  These targets are not easy to achieve because they are, to a degree, in conflict with the demands of the burgeoning, fantastically successful modern economy which this country now enjoys, led by the policies of the Government in the past ten years.  There has been a price to pay for this but we should not write it all off as negative.  I am interested in whether the Green Party does not want to build roads or have people drive their cars.  What does the party want?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	478	The Green Party utterly disagrees with the paradigm the Minister presents of a choice between the economy and the environment.  We agree with the views expressed by Al Gore in his recent film on climate change, which outlines the simple realities of the situation and refutes the Minister's image of a weighing scales with the economy on one side and the planet on the other.  Without a planet, we will not have an economy.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	480	The public has the sense to realise that the solutions that will deliver a new green future are positive for society and the economy.  The Luas service, for example, will allow for the development of enterprise, and more rail lines will benefit the economy in the future.  It is ridiculous that each time the issue of our emissions and climate change is raised, the response is that the Green Party will wreck the economy.  That is not the issue.  Unless we reduce our use of fossil fuels, the Minister will wreck our economy because he is leaving us exposed to the future peak in global oil production.There are a dozen changes the Minister could make tomorrow.  As highlighted by this report, the fuel efficiency of vehicles is decreasing.  He should ask the Minister for Finance to address this so that we begin to purchase leaner vehicles.  The Minister could choose to begin building a rail line to Navan tomorrow morning instead of running a motorway through the Hill of Tara.  He could build a spur to Shannon so that air passengers can access the airport by rail.

Work has begun on all those projects in terms of design, looking at alignment, land routes and so on.  More resources have been provided by this Government than any other in the past.   Given the size and scale of this country, the €34.5 billion allocated in a ten-year framework represents one of the greatest investments per capita in public transport development in the world.  Neither I nor Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Dublin need any lectures from the Green Party about commitment to the environment.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	488	The Minister can show his concern for the environment by taking one simple action.  He must stop the sale by CIE, which it is currently undertaking, of the freight infrastructure and all the equipment associated with the Guinness contract.  It is being sold off because CIE failed to secure the contract.  I suspect it did not try very hard.  It is now selling off the capacity that would allow that service to be recommenced by another operator.  If CIE does not want to provide it, somebody else should do so.The Minister must show his concern in this matter.  Our roads are being completely clogged with heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, which are more likely to be involved in accidents and are completely destroying the environment.  Per tonne carried, rail freight produces only one tenth of the emissions produced by HGVs.  Will the Minister order CIE to stop the sale of not only the infrastructure associated with the transportation of the Guinness kegs but the property and equipment it is selling throughout the State?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	489	It is not doing so.

He is sitting back and allowing this to happen.  We will never be able to bring this equipment back.  It may not be economically viable to CIE but it may be so to somebody else.  The economics are changing daily given the increasing cost of oil and in terms of the fees we will have to pay to the EU for emissions.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	501	The fifth motor insurance directive, No. 2005/14/EC, in regard to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles was adopted on 11 May 2005.  The directive amends and expands on the previous four motor insurance directives.  The fifth directive must be implemented by 11 June 2007.  It requires each member state to establish a national motor insurance information centre.  The purpose of the information centre is to make available, on request, insurance and other details to involved parties in the event of a motor traffic accident.  Persons involved in accidents will therefore have a means to confirm the insurance and vehicle details of other parties to the accident.The fourth motor insurance directive already requires the establishment of an information centre to provide details of insurance and vehicle ownership in the case of accidents involving foreign registered vehicle which occur in this country.  The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland currently discharges this function and provides this information by accessing the national vehicle file maintained by the vehicle registration unit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The fifth directive therefore extends the requirements of the fourth directive to cover all motor traffic accidents, irrespective of where the vehicles are registered.My Department, with the assistance of the Irish Insurance Federation, commissioned preliminary studies into the establishment of the expanded national information centre.  The consultants, Aspen Connect and Tekenable, have proposed a technical solution to enable the necessary information to be accessible to the information centre on request.My Department has primary responsibility for the establishment of the information centre and discussions have taken place with the insurance industry and with the Vehicle Registration Office of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in that regard.  Over the coming months, it is planned to run a pilot project before full implementation, with a view to having the information centre in operation by June 2007.  The funding requirements have yet to be determined.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The problem is that nobody has agreed to fund the database.  The Garda faces a major difficulty in dealing with road traffic offences, particularly those involving injury and loss of life, because it has no way of discovering information on whether a particular driver is insured.  There is no national database accessible to the Garda.  That information should be available on the hand-held computers of gardaí.  This lack of access to adequate information is part of the reason it is so difficult to enforce road traffic legislation.The Minister is ultimately responsible in this regard.  My understanding is that a turf war is ongoing between the relevant Departments and the insurance companies in regard to who will pay for this service.  It is the Minister's responsibility to cut through that and to ensure we comply with the directive and, more important, that access to vital information in respect of motor insurance is available to the Garda in processing cases.  Does he intend to take action in this regard by living up to his responsibilities to put a database in place as promised and required under the directive and, if so, when does he propose to do so?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	503	As I said in my reply, this database must be in place by June of next year and I intend that to be done.  I have obtained solutions from the technical experts and they are currently working out the detail of that.  A pilot scheme will commence early next year and the full system will be in place by June.  The funding implications will be finalised on the basis of the working solution that is established.  This is an issue we need to have in place which is why I have decided to deal with it and meet the timeframe I am obliged to fulfil.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	506	It seems late in the day to agree on the basic issue of funding.  Can the Minister commit to saying it will be publicly funded or that an arrangement will be in place well before June 2007?

I am not convinced that all the costs should be borne by the taxpayer exclusively.  I am sure the Deputy would agree on that point.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	508	My concern is that these delays will continue and we will not meet the June 2007 deadline.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	510	There has been significant investment in infrastructure and services on the DART network and on the Dublin to Rosslare inter-city railway route serving Greystones in recent years.  Notably, Greystones has benefited from expansion in the DART fleet, with the number of carriages almost doubling from 80 to 154 since the year 2000.  In conjunction with the €176 million DART upgrade project, which delivered longer platforms and station improvements to cater for eight-carriage trains, major peak time capacity benefits have resulted.Improvements have also been delivered on the Arklow commuter service serving Greystones and now extended to Gorey.  The Dublin to Rosslare line track renewal was completed in 2004, with almost 80 miles of track upgraded from old jointed track on timber sleepers to modern continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers, yielding safety and journey time benefits.  Combined with the introduction of new commuter railcars in 2003, these investments have resulted in higher capacity and reliability improvements on the route.I understand from Iarnród Éireann that since December 2005 the number of daily services to and from Greystones has increased from 55 to 58 services.  As part of the planning process for next December's timetable, Iarnród Éireann is considering improvements to the morning peak service from Greystones and also providing some additional off-peak services.Further safety and efficiency benefits to inter-city services serving Greystones will be delivered through a €15.8 million resignalling project which is under way.  However, the benefits of all investments to date will culminate and be apparent to passengers with the deployment of some of the 150 inter-city railcars on the route during 2007 and 2008.  These will deliver the highest standards of quality, comfort and reliability and will also allow Iarnród Éireann to make further frequency increases on the route.

I tabled this question for two reasons.  The evening peak time service from Dublin to Gorey was reduced from six carriages to four.  However, I have had correspondence from Iarnród Éireann since I tabled the question that this has been restored to six.Also, Councillor Mitchell, the local mayor, had written to the new chief executive of Iarnród Éireann, Mr. Fearn, who I wish well in his new appointment, seeking to organise a meeting that would also be attended by Councillors Jones and Killilea and a Mr. Dwyer of a local action group.  He sought an enhanced rail service to be provided during December.  The Minister mentioned in his reply that this is under consideration and I hope it proceeds.The population of Greystones is 16,000 and has increased by 33% since 2002.  The Minister stated that the frequency of the rail service has increased, which it has, but it has not kept pace with the growth in population.  The station in Greystones is also used by people further south in Wicklow, Arklow and down the Wexford coast.  I understand that the DART track between Malahide, Howth and Bray uses double track and that south of Bray this is not the case due to technical difficulties involving Bray Head.  However, a report, the name of which I cannot recall, recommended double track be laid down south of the tunnel in Bray.  This could be done, allowing trains to meet on a small section with an area for one train to pull in, and would greatly enhance the service to Greystones.  The costs would be in the region of €1 million.  I ask the Minister to consider raising this issue with Iarnród Éireann, because a small amount of money could facilitate the improvement of this service.  It is reasonably good and has served the people well, but there will be increased demand for it.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I thank the Deputy for his acknowledgement of the investments made and the increases in services in the area in recent years.  However, Iarnród Éireann faces capacity problems in trying to enter Dublin from commuter routes, DART routes and inter-city routes.  We are bursting at the seams.  The planning involved in the new docklands station in Dublin is an example of how this is being approached.  We are trying to create more options for traffic in Dublin so we can further increase capacity.  I believe Iarnród Éireann is considering increased peak and off-peak traffic for the Deputy's area during December and I hope it can deliver.  I am not familiar with the last point raised by the Deputy but I will raise it with Iarnród Éireann on his behalf.Question No. 10 answered with QuestionNo. 6.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 36, 44, 50 and 69 together.As the House will be aware, I established a team, following the launch of Transport 21, to make recommendations on the establishment of a transport authority for the greater Dublin area.  The team reported to me earlier this year.  Since then, my Department has undertaken significant preparatory work and the matter has been considered by Government.  As a result, the drafting of legislation establishing a Dublin transport authority is now at an advanced stage of preparation.In my earlier reply to one of the Priority Questions, I indicated that the Government has decided that the regulation of the bus market and future decisions on the allocation of public subsidies for bus services in the greater Dublin area will be undertaken by the new Dublin transport authority.   I will make an announcement on the other functions of the Dublin transport authority soon.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	514	The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Purcell, issued a report yesterday on integrated ticketing.  The cost to the taxpayer of this issue has been around €9 million so far, and it has been almost as many years in the making.  We have nothing to show for all this, not even a smart card, except that the cost is rising on a daily basis.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did not blame the operators and actors involved, including CIE, Dublin Bus, the Railway Procurement Agency and the private operators.  He blamed the Government because there was nobody to co-ordinate the integrated ticketing system.  He detected uncertainty in all those involved regarding the scale and nature of their roles in the Dublin transport network.  The lack of a Government decision or anyone to co-ordinate critical transport issues in Dublin is creating traffic chaos.  We discuss it every year but it has now reached the point where the suburbs of this city are unbearable.When can we hope to see a transport authority in place?  I see it is down for publication this term.  If it does not have a statutory basis, will the Minister set up an authority that can co-ordinate the major traffic issues facing this city on an interim basis?  This includes the port tunnel, the upgrade of the M50, integrated ticketing, buses and all the elements that need to be examined in this city.  Can the Minister give the House a timescale, if not for a legislative procedure, then for an interim body?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	515	The issue of integrated ticketing came to my attention shortly after I joined the Department of Transport.  I found trying to deal with it deeply frustrating.  It was not possible, for whatever reasons under the structure that was in place, to get the agencies to co-operate with each other.  This was apparent, although I am not laying any blame.

I have put an establishment board in place already.  I will do the same with the Dublin transport authority.  Once the legislation on it is published, I will put it in place, at least in shadow form, as I have done with many other bodies, so that it can get on with the work that is clearly required over a range of areas.  Much of the work the authority will deal with is already happening.  There are very good people already dealing with many of the areas.  What we need now is a co-ordinated approach to some of the overlapping issues affecting the different bodies.

It is now almost October and there has been no movement on it.In an earlier reply, the Minister said that the second tranche of 100 buses for the Dublin market is to be allocated by the new authority.  Bearing in mind that additional buses were needed yesterday and given that we have not even seen the promised legislation, will the Minister give us some idea of the timescale involved with regard to the publication and passage of the legislation and the establishment of the new authority?  When will the authority be in a position to deal with the issue of the additional 100 buses?  From the point of view of the passengers waiting for a bus on the side of the road this evening, it does not matter who is running the buses.  They just want more buses but it seems that under this long-fingered proposal, it is likely to be at least the end of next year before the proposed Dublin transport authority is in a position to deal with the additional buses.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to set out the timescale he has in mind.

I want to see a smooth process of getting another 100 buses on to the market in Dublin through the private sector.  I will do that over the coming months.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

Most of these reports have been commissioned for the purpose of supporting the increased centralisation of hospital services and the downgrading of the smaller hospitals in the region.  This highly centralised model of hospital care is preferred by the Government and the HSE but it is vitally important to state that this is not the only model of hospital care that exists.  At all times, we must challenge the argument that the highly centralised model is the only safe way to deliver hospital services.  It is not.  Other countries and some parts of this country, to some extent, are doing it differently.The bottom line is that the Teamwork report recommends the further loss of services at existing hospital sites in the region, namely Monaghan, Cavan, Navan and Dundalk.  It is basically a re-hash of the Hanly report, which made similar recommendations about hospitals throughout the Twenty-six counties.  The difference with the Teamwork report is that it also holds out the promise, but only the promise, of a new regional hospital.  While the carrot of a major new hospital facility will be attractive for some, for the vast majority of people throughout the north east, it spells the end of our hospitals as we have known them and it places that same majority at an even greater risk, given the distances, road and weather conditions that must be faced in journeying to a far-off new hospital location.The answer to the long standing crisis in our hospital services in the north east lies in the reversal of decisions taken in recent years by the health board and HSE managers, at the behest of the Department of Health and Children and the Minister of the day.  We know we cannot have all services available at all sites but we firmly believe that our existing hospital network should be retained, with essential services provided at all five hospitals and specialist services available on an apportioned basis, where appropriate.The Teamwork report envisages only the most basic of care provision at all existing hospital sites.  Minor injuries, routine diagnostics and outpatient clinics will be the order of the day.  All surgical and medical emergencies and all accident and emergency treatment will be centred in the new regional hospital.  What of travel times from all parts of the north east?  What of the so-called "golden hour"?  Under this plan, more people are being condemned to death because the doors of hospitals will be closed against them.The Teamwork report presents an idealised picture of hospital services in the north east, with a new regional hospital in place and with the five existing hospitals working under the new regime.  What happens in the meantime, as we wait for years for the new regional hospital to be built, if it is ever built?  Already, services have been downgraded further at Monaghan, Dundalk and Navan and ever more pressure is being placed on Cavan General Hospital and the Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  The picture painted by the Teamwork report relies heavily on an ambulance service which is fully staffed with fully trained paramedics.  We do not have such a service.  Only a tiny proportion of ambulance crews — some 2% — is trained up to this level, yet under Teamwork, paramedics will be responsible for emergency care until patients reach the new regional hospital.Do we oppose a new regional hospital?  Certainly not, but it must be a hospital that will provide services in addition to, and as an enhancement of, those already being provided at the existing five hospitals.  Certainly, major change and real improvements will have to take place in the region.  Key services and specialties will be located in the regional hospital, but our focus must be on services as near to the patient and community as possible.  Sinn Féin wants to see the configuration of all hospitals to ensure that emergency services are available as locally as possible.  For the vast majority of the population, these services should be located less than 45 minute's travel time away.  No one should be more than one hour's travel time from an accident and emergency unit, when the three critical access factors of hospital location, road conditions and ambulance provision are taken into account.The report on the death of Mr. Pat Joe Walsh and the HSE's response to that report fails completely to acknowledge that the embargo on acute surgical services and surgical emergencies being dealt with at Monaghan General Hospital led to that tragic death.  The embargo meant that staff at Monaghan General Hospital were prevented from performing a life-saving operation on Pat Joe Walsh.  No amount of placing blame on others will dispense with that fact.  As highlighted in the report, the matter was compounded by the failure of Cavan and Drogheda hospitals to accept the transfer of Pat Joe Walsh, despite his critical condition and the availability of beds therein.Monaghan General Hospital is being turned into a five-day week, limited service medical centre.  There is consternation at the HSE, which has the full backing of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and her Fianna Fáil colleagues in Government, who are dealing the final death blow to Monaghan General Hospital.  It is doing a grave disservice to the memory of Pat Joe Walsh that the report emanating on his death is now being used as a tool to aid the objective of further eroding services at the hospital, given that such erosion already contributed to his tragic death.My party and I pledge our continued and outright opposition to what I can only describe as the scorched earth policy of the HSE and the Government regarding acute hospital services in the north-east region.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.The Government did not write this report or any previous report on Monaghan General Hospital.  External consultants were retained to write the reports.  One of the consequences of the agitation regarding this hospital is that as each complaint is made about a particular incident, a report is then compiled which does not find favour with those concerned about services in the hospital.  All involved should reflect on that fact.The Health Service Executive has recently established a steering group and a north east project group to oversee a programme designed to improve safety and standards across the acute hospital network in the north-east region.  The decision was taken having regard to the issues raised in the report prepared for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services, Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East, and taking account of the findings of the recent report into the death of Mr. Patrick J. Walsh.  Led by the HSE's National Hospitals Office, the steering group has representation from key stakeholders such as clinicians and primary care providers.  The project group is being led by a consultant surgeon from outside the region.The report concluded that the present system, in which five local hospitals deliver acute care to relatively small populations in the region, is exposing patients to increased risks and creating additional professional risks for staff.  The report highlights the need to develop a high quality and responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards, by developing local services within existing hospitals and other local centres supported by a new regional hospital.The HSE recently published the report of the independent inquiry into the death of Mr. Walsh.  The report details the difficulties that arose in trying to secure his transfer from Monaghan to either Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, or Cavan General Hospital.  It also exposes a failure in communications between clinicians and hospitals in the region.Since the death of Mr. Walsh, a new protocol in respect of patient transfer has been put in place.  It provides that all requests for transfer from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital or Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, should be granted and processed immediately.International best practice demonstrates that patients have better outcomes when treated in hospitals with appropriate numbers of specialist staff, high volumes of activity and access to the right diagnostic and treatment facilities.  Patient safety and quality must be paramount and must be the key drivers in the reconfiguration of our acute hospital services.  The policy of the Government is to provide safe, high quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.  This will mean rebalancing service delivery so those services that can be safely delivered locally are delivered locally and that more complex services that require specialist input are concentrated at regional centres.The HSE has assured the Minister that, in progressing the implementation of the Teamwork report and the report of the independent inquiry into the death of Mr. Walsh, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	547	I first raised this matter on 29 September 2005 and highlighted the misuse of management companies in traditional housing estates.  I was surprised by the reply to that debate.  It was very clear that the information I had placed on the record was news to the Minister.  I gave the Minister my evidence and followed it up with a priority question which was afforded to me by my Independent colleagues.  The Minister was quite clear in his reply that management companies were not to be used by local authorities to sidestep their responsibilities in taking estates in charge.I am interested in finding resolutions to the many problems that have been highlighted to me since first raising this matter.  I have always accepted the need for management companies in the context of apartment blocks.  The regulation of these ranges from good to appalling.  I received a phone call yesterday from someone who took up occupancy of an apartment under the affordable housing scheme earlier this year.  The person received a bill for €900 from the management company yesterday and is being asked to contribute towards a sinking fund for a lift.  However, there is no lift in the apartment block in question and the person is being asked to contribute towards public lighting and public liability insurance in the overall estate, which is a mixed development.Initially, most management companies' directors are friends or relations of the developer of the scheme.  On completion of the last dwelling, the shareholders, in other words the owners of the apartments, are supposed to be called to a meeting at which a new set of directors should be elected by the shareholders.  These meetings are either not being called or, where they are being called, there is often reluctance to take on responsibility for what is in effect a company governed by company law.I typically find that a minimum of one third of the bill charged by a management company is for administrative purposes, even in the early stages.  In Kildare, quite a number of the dwellings that will be provided under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2005 will be apartments, some of which will be of the social and affordable variety.  There are already problems in that the council is telling residents to contact their management company and very often, they do not respond.  It is not clear how the council will be represented on these management companies and the person or persons representing the council will need to be sufficiently competent in company law or problems will arise for it.  I ask that this issue be considered seriously.Consider those living in housing estates where a management company was or is mandatory.  Conditions of this kind are sometimes attached to the planning permission but many are conditions of sale.  Not only does the developer want to make a killing on the price of the house but he wants the residents to pick up the tab for all the maintenance obligations until the estate is taken in charge.  While it appears local authorities no longer impose these conditions, which is very welcome, management companies continue to be imposed as part of a condition of sale in many locations.  This needs to be addressed in legislation.In some locations, including my own, there is a considerable backlog.  Kildare has front-loaded the taking in charge of estates where a planning condition was imposed requiring a management company.  However, it depends on the estate being finished satisfactorily.  Some local authorities, particularly those in areas with continuous and rapid development, are concerned with the costs they will incur when large numbers of estates are taken in charge.  While they might have large capital receipts that will go towards the provision of infrastructure, there is a serious problem with the revenue accounts.  That needs to be factored into the local government fund if the problem is to be resolved properly.The staff embargo also needs to be considered.  Restrictions are such that where a development control unit is put in place, it is done at the expense of other sections of the council.  In the case of Kildare, there seems to be an ever-increasing list of unauthorised developments and the price is being paid for it.The Office of Corporate Enforcement is receiving large numbers of complaints about management companies not being run properly.  I constantly get calls from people asking if they should go along to the annual general meeting and whether they should allow the developer to walk away.  The planning conditions attaching to a development are often not complied with.  Residents cannot see what they are paying for.  A number of initiatives have been suggested and a consultation paper is expected shortly.  The National Consumer Agency is to produce an information document, but it depends what is in it.  The amendment to company law expected later this year seems to be piecemeal in comparison with the extent of the problem, which requires legislation in its own right.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I reply on behalf of Deputy Roche, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I accept there is much concern about the management of multi-unit developments.  Many of the issues in the area involve several different parties in the public and private sector.  I know the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is actively engaging with those parties.  The Department looks forward to the publication by the Law Reform Commission of the consultation paper on the management of multi-unit structures.  It is expected shortly and will be followed by a final report that will enable the Government to consider what legal measures must be taken in the area.In the meantime, several developments have taken place regarding this matter.  Planning authorities traditionally required, as a condition of planning permission, that a management company be established for apartment developments.  In response to concerns that planning conditions requiring management companies were being inappropriately applied to other residential estates, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government carried out a survey of county, city and borough councils in late 2005 and early 2006.  It found that planning authorities had been attaching planning conditions requiring management companies in mixed developments of apartments and houses, but generally only to the apartment elements.  Regarding estates comprising houses only, planning authorities had occasionally attached such conditions, but only in very specific circumstances, for example, holiday home or gated developments.The Department issued a circular letter to planning authorities on the matter in July 2006.  It states that a management company should not be conditioned by a planning authority for a "traditional" housing estate, that is, estates of houses with individual private gardens, except in very specific circumstances, for example, if a particular service or facility is provided for residents' use only, such as a playground.  The Department has also advised planning authorities that they should attach planning conditions to the ongoing management of shared facilities only in circumstances where they judge that they are clearly required for the benefit of residents of an estate.A previous circular issued in January 2006 had already reminded planning authorities of their responsibilities under the Planning and Development Act 2000 regarding the taking in charge of such estates.The question of who should be responsible for the maintenance of certain shared facilities in the newer type of mixed estate, that is, whether and to what extent planning authorities should take those in charge or what responsibilities residents should have for maintenance, requires further consideration.The Department has therefore established a working group representative of the interests involved to look further at those matters.  Its first meeting is being held today.The property services regulatory authority will have the function of licensing, regulating and dealing with complaints relating to managing agents.  These are commercial firms engaged by management companies to carry out day-to-day management and maintenance.  The authority will also have a public information function regarding property management.  The authority and its functions will be provided for in legislation currently being prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I understand an implementation group and a director designate are already in place.The National Consumer Agency is to publish a report on the issue of management charges very shortly and also intends to publish a consumer information document, which should help reduce the information deficit.The Law Reform Commission, LRC, has already recommended certain changes to company law to avoid problems for management companies regarding company law requirements.  Proposals for the amendment of company law are expected to be made to the Government later this year, and the Minister expects those to include certain changes relevant to management companies.The Minister is conscious these are matters of great concern, and every effort is being made to address them in the most appropriate manner.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I have raised the issue of airport smuggling checks on several occasions, as have certain party colleagues.  As the Minister of State has pointed out, customs regulation is ultimately a function of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  I call for the introduction of permanent customs and security checks at Weston Executive Airport and all the other small airports around the country following yesterday's seizure of drugs from a passenger and the arrest of the pilot and co-pilot on a flight to Belgium that originated there.Small airports dotted around the country unsurprisingly offer great opportunities for smuggling drugs, goods and even people into Ireland and the EU.  I congratulate gardaí on the success of their operation in co-operation with Belgian police.  They intercepted a massive quantity of heroin that would otherwise have made it onto the streets of Ireland, Britain or mainland Europe and brought misery to people's lives.However, that two Irishmen were arrested and that the flight originated at a private Irish airport, that an Irish plane was used, and that no security was in place suggests that our small airports risk being used as staging-posts in the international drugs trade.  Criminals are clearly able to charter private aircraft and proceed to rendezvous points either in this country or abroad without the authorities knowing of their cargo or the purpose of their journey.  That is extraordinary, and the Government must move quickly to address that anomaly, particularly as we all know that in Celtic tiger Ireland there has been massive growth in the ownership of private aeroplanes and helicopters.Moreover, it is staggering that private individuals can lease their aircraft or allow them to be used by others, as was the suggestion yesterday regarding Mr. Mansfield, the owner of the plane.  I understand his company also owns Weston Aerodrome.  He appears to have been completely in the dark regarding what the aeroplane was being used for.  There must clearly be a wholesale review of security arrangements, and especially customs arrangements, at every airport in the country.  We cannot have Ireland as a drop-off point or staging-post for the international drugs trade.Weston's location in west Dublin and the severe problems of gang and drug violence on the entire west side of the city, of which I know the Minister of State is acutely aware, make it a particularly vulnerable target.  If one adds to that the absolute lack of community policing there and the intelligence that such policing would provide, one sees that we are very vulnerable.  We want the kind of surveillance at those small airports that one has nowadays in Dublin Airport.  Statistics on seizures there show that the use of sniffer dogs and more up-to-date technology to track flights and so on will, over a period, produce results.We clearly now have an unlocked door at small airports regarding smuggling and the international drugs trade.  We saw in the Ryder Cup the massive use of private helicopters and aircraft in and out of Weston and similar locations on the west side of Dublin.  Thankfully, what happened this time has ended with some success for the policing authority.  However, a plan must be put in place immediately, and we clearly require the co-operation not only of the customs authorities and the Minister for Finance but of the Garda and policing authorities.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Finance and the Customs Service of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  I thank Deputy Burton for raising this matter.The Customs Service of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation.  It has particular responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State, specifically at ports and airports, including licensed airfields, and on the land frontier.  The control of licensed airfields in the State is carried out by customs enforcement teams.  Those are dedicated anti-smuggling teams that focus on the smuggling of prohibited drugs and fiscal products.Other duties undertaken by officers in attending licensed airfields include the clearance of aircraft and passengers arriving from third countries, spot checks on EU flights, the verification of fuel drawback claims, verification of end-use authorisations, clearance of aircraft under transfer of residence, and checks on private aircraft to ensure compliance with import procedures.Best practice in customs administration worldwide shows that the development of information and intelligence is critical to the detection of drug smuggling.  In Ireland, this has become very important since the completion of the Single Market in 1993, based as it is on the free movement of goods and people within the Community.  As EU citizens have the right of free movement, Revenue has no power to stop an EU citizen except on the basis of a suspicion, normally grounded in specific intelligence.A number of years ago, Revenue introduced a memorandum of understanding initiative, which involved reaching agreement with a number of organisations, trade associations and individual companies in the transport industry to encourage them to join the fight against drug smuggling as part of the Customs Drugs Watch programme.  The programme incorporates a coastal and airfield reporting system whereby local customs officers visit all licensed aerodromes and airfields regularly.  They have put in place a confidential system of communication between the licensed aerodrome operators and customs enforcement.  Through this network, which is two-way, officers have discussed with the operators such matters as known methods used by drug smugglers and indicators of suspicious activity.  This can help the operators in identifying situations and activities that may indicate a drug smuggling operation is under way and which they should report.  This reporting system is an important element in the fight against drug smuggling.In addition to local intelligence, the Customs and Excise shares and receives information and intelligence on drug smuggling from a number of international bodies, including the World Customs Organisation, United Nations Drug Control Programme, Interpol, Council of Europe, Europol and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency.Customs and Excise liaises on an ongoing basis with other national and international enforcement services such as the Garda Síochána, the Naval Service, the Air Corps, and foreign customs and police services.  It takes part regularly in European, bilateral and national surveillance operations focused on specific drug smuggling methodologies, including general aviation.  Some of these operations have been specifically directed at light aircraft and helicopter movements.The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment in detail on specific operations in the criminal area of drug smuggling.  The reported seizure earlier this week in Belgium of 50 kg of heroin, the arrest of three Irish nationals and the seizure of an aircraft based at Weston Aerodrome are of major concern to the Revenue Commissioners.  To give an indication of the volume of arrivals in the State through Weston, the Minister understands that from February 2006 to the end of July 2006 there have been 142 flight arrivals from EU countries there and five from non-EU countries.  This is in comparison with 1,500 flights every week arriving in Dublin Airport.  It should be noted that drugs to the value of €6.7 million have been seized by Customs and Excise to date in 2006 at Dublin Airport.In 2004, officers attached to the Dublin enforcement district carried out 12 planned and six unplanned visits to Weston.  During 2005, ten planned and six unplanned and to-date in 2006, 11 planned and three unplanned visits have been made to Weston by officers of the Revenue's customs service.In light of the Belgian seizure this week, the Minister is advised that the Revenue Commissioners are reviewing the risks attached to the operation of, and procedures attaching to, all 27 licensed aerodromes in the State, including in particular Weston.  I am assured that the monitoring of licensed aerodromes in the State by the Revenue Commissioners is in line with international standards.  The Revenue's customs service is continually engaged in the analysis and evaluation of seizure trends, routes and smuggling risks and consequential resource deployment.  All Customs and Excise operations are risk focused, and staff are deployed to combat areas of greatest risk.  The level of activity at licensed aerodromes is constantly monitored from a risk perspective.However, in light of the concerns raised by the seizure this week, the conditions under which the Revenue Commissioners approve licensed aerodromes will be immediately reviewed.  The review will include options for improving the level of control and prior reporting of arrivals from EU and non-EU countries.  Revenue will also review the frequency of checking incoming flights to these aerodromes.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	554	My issue is substantially the same.  I am glad to hear the Minister of State state that the Customs and Excise cover is now being reviewed.  The local Independent Deputy for the Weston area, however, Deputy Catherine Murphy, who is present, raised this issue with the Minister on Question Time in February this year.  In the reply on that occasion, the Minister accepted that customs officers should visit the aerodrome regularly as a check against the landing or exploitation of prohibitive goods, in particular controlled drugs, but it did not happen.  It is now water under the bridge, but I hope the Minister will be somewhat more attentive when these issues are raised in the future.I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in his reply on behalf of the Minister for Finance, said that the total value of drugs that came into Dublin Airport in one year which were seized came to €6.7 million.  Despite this, one flight to Weston yesterday could have brought in €10 million worth of the worst of drugs, heroin.  It is no wonder that licence cover should now be reviewed.  This is in the context of the seizure of a consignment of heroin valued at €7 million at Ratoath, County Meath, a couple of months ago.  These amounts of heroin are unprecedented in the history of the drugs crisis in this State.  It seems to be in the context of the enormous heroin crop in Afghanistan in recent times.  Whatever happened via Weston when the Belgian authorities were able to seize the drugs demonstrates the sophisticated level the international drugs trade has reached.  Unfortunately, the replies to Deputy Catherine Murphy in this House indicate that this State has not reached the same sophisticated level in response to these issues.  I hope to heaven that it does respond effectively.One other aspect of this concerns me.  Apparently an executive jet with half a dozen people on board or whatever can land at Weston and they can just step into a taxi on the tarmac and drive off.  That is quite incredible in this day and age.  There is no check by the Garda or Customs and Excise or anybody.  We know the owners of Weston have not got a great record in terms of their respect for the law of this land.  I am not sure why the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, finds this so amusing.  I do not find it amusing.  Neither do I believe does Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has raised this issue for a long time, find it amusing.The reality is that this plane was owned by Mr. Mansfield.

I find that an additional worrying aspect to the manner in which this airport has been used by the international drugs trade.  I hope all these issues are addressed.  I have already raised this issue on the floor of the House in the context of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill today.  I called on the Minister to ensure that the Criminal Assets Bureau thoroughly investigates all those connected with that drugs operation in Belgium.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	559	I thank Deputy Gregory for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to update the House on this matter.The reported seizure earlier this week in Belgium of 50 kg of heroin, the arrest of three Irish nationals and the seizure of an aircraft based at Weston Aerodrome is a matter of major concern to the Government.  All attempts at large-scale smuggling of illegal drugs into this country need to be considered in the context in which such activity takes place.  The global illicit drugs trade, according to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, is reputed to exceed billions of dollars annually.  The key drivers for this phenomenon include both economics and the attitude of societies towards illicit drug consumption.The economic environment impacts on illicit drug consumption and supply in two principal ways.  First, the increased prosperity brought about by globalisation and by the development of our own economy has provided significant disposable income to most citizens.  This has pulled the demand for drugs within the State, as well as making Ireland a popular market for criminal organisations involved in the international drugs market.  Second, globalisation itself has caused international trade in both goods and services to increase exponentially over the past decade, making it easier for criminal networks to conceal illicit commodities within legitimate freight.  As a small open economy Ireland is particularly vulnerable.  The economics of drug trafficking make it a particularly attractive activity for criminal organisations.  This is principally driven by the considerable financial rewards which can accrue at each stage of the trafficking process.  With the potential for high profit margins which the business of drug trafficking can facilitate, it is hardly surprising that drug trafficking and distribution is such an attractive prospect for organised crime.The second major factor influencing the illicit drugs trade is the attitude within societies to the consumption of illicit drugs.  Ireland continues to record significant levels of drug prevalence, as demonstrated by the results of the most recent comprehensive drug prevalence study conducted by the national advisory committee on drugs in 2002 and 2003.  The significant demand for illegal drugs by Irish citizens fuels the drugs trade as well as the organised criminal gangs that supply and distribute illegal drugs within this society.  The national drugs strategy addresses the problem of drug misuse across a number of pillars — supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research — and implementation of the strategy across a range of Departments and agencies is co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.The criminal justice response is primarily, though not exclusively, in the area of drug supply control and the Garda plays a key role in tackling the problem of drug misuse locally, nationally and internationally.  Garda strategies for dealing with drug offences are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs.  These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies within and outside the jurisdiction to address the national as well as international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution.  These strategies continue to result in operational successes as evidenced by the ongoing levels of drugs seized by the Garda.  The trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs at local, national and international level is constantly monitored by the Garda.The Customs and Excise service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation.  The service has particular responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State, specifically at ports, airports, including licensed airfields, and on the land frontier.  A number of the specific measures being undertaken by both the Garda and the customs service to address the issues raised by the Deputy include continued co-operation between the Garda and the Customs and Excise service under the terms of the memorandum of understanding in place between both agencies in the proactive investigation of persons suspected to be involved in international drug trafficking; continued liaison with various law enforcement agencies throughout Europe through Europol and Interpol; ongoing formal and informal contact with management of aerodromes throughout the country; ongoing liaison with the Irish Aviation Authority in regard to the registration of aircraft and licensing of flight crews; rigorous checks on the issue of airside passes at larger airports to flight crews of smaller aircraft; and the customs drug watch programme which incorporates a coastal and airfield reporting system whereby local customs officers visit all licensed aerodromes and airfields regularly.  This also includes a confidential system of communication between the licensed aerodrome operators and the Customs and Excise service.  In addition to local intelligence, the customs service shares and receives information and intelligence on drug smuggling from a number of international bodies.In light of the Belgian seizure this week, the Minister has been advised that the Revenue Commissioners are reviewing the risks attached to the operation of all 27 licensed aerodromes in the State, including Weston. The Government has been assured that the monitoring of licensed aerodromes in the State by the Revenue Commissioners is currently in line with international standards.  The  Customs and Excise service is continuously engaged in the analysis and evaluation of seizure trends, routes and smuggling risks and consequential resource deployment.  All customs operations are risk focussed and staff are deployed to combat areas of greatest risk.  The level of activity at licensed aerodromes is constantly monitored from a risk perspective.  However, in light of the concerns raised by the seizure this week, the conditions of under which the Revenue Commissioners approve licensed aerodromes will be immediately reviewed.  This review will include options for improving the level of control and prior reporting of arrivals from EU and non-EU countries.  The Revenue Commissioners will also review the frequency of checking incoming flights to these aerodromes.The Government's top policing priority for 2006 is to target organised crime, including drug trafficking, and to ensure that the necessary strategies and measures are in place to tackle the problem.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 89 and 99 together.At the outset, I should explain that overall responsibility for the planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the M50 upgrade, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the local authorities concerned.  I have no function in relation to the day-to-day operation of these projects.In addition, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads, including the M50, is vested in the National Roads Authority (NRA) under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000).The upgrade work on the M50 is being undertaken in three phases.  Phase 1 comprises the widening of the carriageway between the N4 (Galway Road roundabout) and Ballymount interchanges and the upgrading of the N4, N7 and Ballymount interchanges.  This work is currently under way and is expected to be completed in mid-2008.  Phase 2 which is being administered as a Public Private Partnership project will comprise of the widening of the remainder of the M50 (other than the 3.2km West-Link section between the N3 and N4 junctions) and the upgrade of the other interchanges.  The contract for Phase 2 is to be awarded in 2007 and construction is expected to be completed in 2010.  Phase 3 comprises the widening of the 3.2km West-Link section between the N3 and N4 junctions which is expected to be completed by mid 2008.Separately the NRA are procuring the replacement of the current West Link toll plaza with barrier free tolling.  It is intended that this will be introduced during 2008 in tandem with the completion of phase 1 of the M50 upgrade.I expect, therefore, that significant improvements in the situation on the M50 will take place in 2008.  Further improvement will take place on completion of the later phases of the upgrade in 2010.  In the meantime, traffic management in the area is being monitored on an ongoing basis with measures being taken where possible to alleviate traffic congestion resulting from the road works.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	561	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 41 and 91 together.Two independent reviews of the integrated ticketing project were undertaken earlier this year.  Both strongly recommended  continuing with the project, albeit with enhanced governance arrangements being put in place.  On foot of these reviews, I announced last July that I was in the process of establishing an Integrated Ticketing Project Board with responsibility for delivering the project.The Project Board has now been established and is chaired by Mr. David O'Callaghan, a former Secretary General at the Department of Defence.  The Board comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executives of the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA), Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, Bus Éireann and a representative of licensed private bus operators.  An Assistant Secretary from my Department is also on the Board and a senior representative of the Department of Social & Family Affairs also attends as required.The Project Board is responsible for the successful delivery of the smartcard technology required to deliver an integrated ticketing system within an agreed specification, timeline and budget.  The Board is also to consider such other technical scope and design issues as may be necessary to complete delivery of the smart card technology (e.g. technical design issues in relation to possible fare structures and levels, ticket products, revenue collection strategies, data requirements etc).  Before a public transport operator can proceed with any of its own ticketing investment proposals, the operator will be required to satisfy the Board that the proposed equipment is consistent with the integrated ticketing requirements.Some €10.5 million has been paid out to date by the Exchequer on integrated ticketing since commencement of the project in 2002.  During the period of the recent reviews, my Department recognised that there were ongoing costs associated with the project pending the completion of both reviews.  It took the view, subsequently endorsed by both reviews, that if the project team and associated expertise were to be lost, it would have resulted in significant nugatory expenditure and would have been difficult to resurrect the project in its current form.On its establishment, I set the Board a number of immediate tasks, including to review and settle by way of agreement the scope, timelines and budget for the phased completion of the integrated ticketing project.  I have asked the Project Board to report back to me by September, 2006 with an agreed delivery strategy for the integrated ticketing project, including an assessment of the scope, timelines and budget.  I expect to receive this report in the coming days.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	562	As I have stated previously in the House, proposals in relation to the development of Dublin Airport, including the planning and provision of runway capacity, are in the first instance a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airport and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers.Accordingly, the issue of cost benefit analysis in relation to the proposed second runway at Dublin Airport is a matter which falls within the responsibility of the management and board of the DAA.  The DAA are of course required to comply with the capital appraisal guidelines issued by the Department of Finance and responsibility for compliance with the guidelines rests with the Board of the company.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	563	The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) is currently undertaking extensive work in relation to the Metro North.The RPA has completed the public consultation process for the route alignment.  The selection of the route is a matter for the RPA.  I understand that the Board of the RPA expects to make a formal announcement in the near future regarding the preferred alignment.  The Chairman of the Board will be meeting me next week to brief me on this announcement.Further public consultation on the detailed design of the preferred route will be carried out by the RPA in the New Year.  Thereafter, there will be a formal Public Inquiry procedure giving further opportunity to stakeholders to raise any issues or concerns regarding the project.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	564	The European Commission has indicated that it intends to propose measures for the mandatory use of Daytime Running Lights (DRL) on motor vehicles.  In a consultation paper on the matter which it published last month, the Commission outlined the approach it prefers for EU legislation on this matter.  The preferred proposed strategy would require new vehicles sold after a particular date to be equipped with dedicated DRL that automatically switches on once the engine is running and for existing vehicles to be driven with dipped headlights on at any time.The Commission proposals are likely to be brought forward soon.  Against that background the Road Safety Authority will assess the situation in the context of an overall road safety strategy and advise me on any legislative action that may be appropriate ahead of the impending EU proposals.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	565	I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 40 and 68 together.Dangerous driving and drink driving are amongst the most serious road traffic offences and as such lead to a direct court summons rather than coming within the administrative option of paying a fixed charge and accepting penalty points.In the case of dangerous driving, where a person is convicted of the offence, he/she faces a fine of up to €2,500, or where death or serious injury was caused €15,000.  In addition, a person convicted of a first offence of dangerous driving may face disqualification from driving for one year, and for a second and subsequent offence, two years.  Where death or serious injury occurs, the person can be disqualified for 2 years for a first offence and 4 years for a second or subsequent offence.The intended effect of the penalty points system is to instil greater caution and responsibility in motorists in relation to their driving and to change the behaviour of drivers who recurringly breach road traffic law.  A six-month driving disqualification arises from the accumulation of 12 penalty points.The most serious driving offences (including dangerous driving and drink driving), which can attract automatic disqualification upon first court conviction, therefore, do not come within the penalty points system or the system of fixed charges.The Road Traffic Act 2006, which was enacted in July, has strengthened the legislative position in relation to drinking and driving.  The Act provides for the operation of Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) checkpoints which have been operating since then.  The increased levels of enforcement arising from the introduction of the MAT system, should have a significant deterrent effect on those who would otherwise drink and drive.  The 2006 Act also proposes increases to both the fines and periods of disqualification relating to dangerous driving and drink driving offences.  These provisions will be brought into effect shortly, once the necessary administrative and technical arrangements have been settled by the agencies concerned.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	566	The planning and design of the Navan Rail Link is a matter for Iarnród Éireann in the first instance.  I understand that the old Navan rail line will be re-opened in two phases with the first phase running off the Maynooth line, at Clonsilla, to the M3 interchange at Pace, near Dunboyne.  There will be a major Park and Ride facility at Pace on the M3 interchange.The current position regarding this phase is that detailed design work is underway and Iarnród Éireann expect to submit a Railway Order application in mid 2007 for statutory approval to enable the railway upgrade works to proceed with a view to completion of phase 1 in 2009 as provided for in Transport 21.It is proposed to extend the rail line to Navan within the period of Transport 21.  Iarnród Éireann and Meath County Council are developing terms of reference for a scoping study for the extension to Navan.  I understand that the scope of work for the feasibility study has been defined and the procurement process for the engagement of consultants to carry out this work is expected to be completed by November and that the study should commence shortly thereafter.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 32, 55 and 100 together.I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 5 of today.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	568	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 75 together.The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads, including the M50, is vested in the National Roads Authority (NRA) under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000).As the Deputy is aware, in January of this year, the NRA decided to replace the West-Link toll on the M50 by a single-point barrier free toll in 2008.  The installation of barrier free tolling is a crucial element of the M50 upgrade which is underway at present.  In that context, the NRA have initiated a tender competition for the provision of free flow tolling services with the objective of having free flow tolling arrangements operational on the M50 by mid 2008.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 64, 71 and 106 together.The Strategic Rail Review, commissioned by my Department, contained a comprehensive examination of the rail freight business and its realistic potential to support economic development and contribute to sustainable development.Iarnród Éireann, in responding to the challenges contained in the Review, developed a business plan with regard to freight.  The company's goal is to return the rail freight business to profitability.  To help achieve this turnaround, Iarnród Éireann withdrew from loss-making groupage, palletised and single container rail transport.  However, Iarnród Éireann continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present such as in bulk and trainload traffic.  This has resulted in the deficit on rail freight being reduced by 50% in the last three years.Since 1999, Iarnród Éireann has invested over 1.5 billion euro in rebuilding the railways, with Government and EU support for the investment programme.  This has delivered improvements in new trains, upgraded infrastructure and customer facilities.  While such investment has primarily focused on improving passenger services, the investment in improving rail infrastructure also has a direct beneficial impact on freight activities.  Iarnród Éireann has no plans to eliminate capacity or freight infrastructure.Iarnród Éireann has made progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, including mineral ore and pulpwood.  For example Iarnród Éireann has:increased the trainload pulpwood business by modifying surplus wagons and providing additional services for Coillte between the West of Ireland and the South East;altered rail schedules and is currently providing three additional trains per week for Tara Mines with a potential to carry an extra 85,000 tonnes of lead and zinc between Navan and Dublin Port per annum, andmodified surplus platform wagons to provide a trainload service for containers between Ballina and Waterford Port.I have introduced the European Communities (Access to Railway Infrastructure) (Amendment) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 780 of 2005), implementing EU Directive 2004/51 on the development of the Community's Railways.  These Regulations open the freight market to competition from both domestic and foreign operators, from 1 January 2006 in the case of international freight, and from 1 January 2007 in the case of domestic freight operations.I should add that Iarnród Éireann has undertaken extensive engagement with industry and transporters around the country to try to identify long-term sustainable business opportunities.  They have had genuine difficulty in identifying business opportunities that offer reasonable volumes of business on a regular basis.  It is not feasible to run trains with one or two containers and Iarnród Eireann has not identified sufficient business to group a number of separate activities together to form a viable trainload.  Most Irish industry is focused on ‘just in time' transport and as our road network continues to expand and improve across the country, the role of rail freight becomes more problematic because all rail journeys involve road movements at each end of the logistics chain.  Furthermore, in Ireland distances are short.  The experience across Europe is no different.  Rail freight activities are most economic where distances are long, where there are large volumes to be transported and where the freight to be carried is not time sensitive.As part of the engagement with industry Iarnród Éireann works closely with port authorities, such as in Dublin relating to transport of lead and zinc and Waterford relating to container traffic, to increase rail based freight.  The Government's Ports Policy Statement recognises the need for the integration of ports as a fundamental link in the supply chain, with other transport modes including rail.  The assignment of responsibility for maritime transport, including ports to my Department will facilitate the pursuit of this objective.I am open to any views on how we can expand rail freight but the business environment is such that I have not seen any real opportunities identified.  The market for rail freight will be fully liberalised in a matter of months and if there were opportunities I would welcome expressions of interest.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 29 together.I have indicated on previous occasions that I am not happy with the current driving licence system and that I am anxious to bring in reforms to the system.Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for the oversight of the operation of the driver licensing system.  In addition under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 it is open to the Road Safety Authority to make recommendations in relation to the promotion of better driving standards and to draw up road safety programmes.The Road Safety Authority will be examining the driver licensing system and will make recommendations as to what further reforms might be introduced in the interests of road safety.  The requirements concerning accompaniment and supervision of learner drivers would of course be a matter to be considered by the RSA in such deliberations as would be the desirability of requiring novice drivers undergo further training or supervision.Deputies will be aware of the significant measures that have been taken to help reduce the waiting times for driving tests.  I have not set a precise target waiting time at which any reforms of the licensing system will be introduced.  Rather, I will keep the matter under review having regard to the impact that the introduction of measures will have on the waiting times, and the desirability of introducing reforms in the interests of road safety.  In this regard, I might mention that reforms may be introduced on a phased basis rather than all at once.I should point out that at present provisional licence holders are generally required to be accompanied by and under the supervision of a person qualified to drive the category of vehicle being driven.  The only exception to this is where the driver holds a second provisional licence in respect of a car or is the holder of a provisional licence to drive motorcycles or tractors/work vehicles.As regards renewal of provisional licences, it is a regulatory condition for eligibility for renewal of a provisional licence that the person has generally within the proceeding period of two years undergone the driving test.  This condition does not apply where the applicant satisfies the licensing authority that because of illness, as certified by a registered medical practitioner, the person was not in a position to submit to a driving test.  Otherwise, the person must produce evidence to the licensing authority that a driving test has been arranged for that person.  The conditions concerning renewal will be considered as part of the review of the licensing system.

Formal admission of the shares to the Official Lists of the Irish Stock Exchange and the UK Financial Services Authority will take place next Monday (2 October) and unconditional dealings will commence on that date.The Government's overarching objective has always been to provide the Company with access to new equity to enable it to compete effectively and fund the growth of its business.  The company will, through the issue of new shares, raise gross proceeds of the order of half a billion Euro.In addition, I expect that the State will raise gross proceeds of around €200m.  I have said on several occasions that the State would retain a minimum shareholding of 25.1%.  The State's retained shareholding is now expected to be approximately 28.3%.  Approximately 2.8% of this shareholding is subject to a call in favour of the Employee Share Ownership Trust, and to protect against the dilution effect of the issue of bonus shares to certain investors in twelve months time.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	574	Oversight arrangements for the National Car Testing scheme are now vested in the Road Safety Authority since 13th September 2006 as a consequence of the Road Safety Authority (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006.I understand from the Authority that the remit of the national car test (NCT) scheme is to determine periodically the roadworthiness condition of passenger cars and small public service vehicles.  Where such vehicles fail a roadworthiness test, they are not issued with a NCT test certificate and the owner is provided with a test report in accordance with the rules for the scheme.  There are no proposals under consideration to alter the remit of the current NCT scheme.In so far as issues concerning breaches of the law are concerned including those relating to the unlawful use of vehicles, these are matters for the Garda Síochána to investigate and prosecute if appropriate.  If the Deputy has specific information concerning breaches of the law, these should be brought to the attention of the Garda Síochána.Finally, should the Deputy have particular proposals concerning the national car testing scheme, these can be sent to me or alternatively to the Chief Executive Officer of the Road Safety Authority.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 35 together.Following a wide-ranging consultation process involving users, statutory authorities and other interested parties, the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) recently published its proposals for a second terminal at Dublin Airport (T2).  A detailed planning application for the terminal and related facilities was submitted to Fingal County Council on 31 August 2006.  Subject to the outcome of the planning process, construction of the new terminal will begin in summer 2007.The DAA has informed me that as part of this consultation process it was made aware of the updated expansion of some of the key airlines operating out of Dublin Airport.  To accommodate this growth the DAA decided to develop a 75,000 sq. metre terminal instead of the initially planned 50,000 metre facility.  This 50% expansion in the scale of the development, and the attendant increase in the complexity of some of its features, are the key reasons for the increase in the cost of the facility which is now estimated to be €395m and which will be funded by the DAA.  DAA is working to deliver the terminal by late 2009.The consultants appointed by my Department to verify the specification and cost of the proposed Terminal Two at Dublin Airport, have now completed their work and submitted their report.  The following are the main findings of the Boyd Creed Sweett report:the consultation process with stakeholders in the development of requirements for the new terminal and the methodology, approach and execution of the planning objectives and considerations for passengers accords with best practice;the development of the structural proposals is in accordance with best practice and the scheme chosen is comparable with that used in similar airport terminal buildings;the estimated cost of Terminal Two on a cost per square metre basis lies at the mid point range of a UK terminal buildings benchmarking study; andthe benchmarking study and the Terminal Two cost plan have been independently verified by the consultants, who conclude that the estimated cost of the new terminal is within industry norms for this type of project in a European capital city.It is envisaged by the DAA that additional terminal facilities will be required after 2015.  Fingal County Council has included provision for a third terminal on the western campus in its Dublin Airport Masterplan in June last and this is an important aspect of facilitating timely additional capacity.

On the 19 June last I launched a document entitled "Consultation on the Regulation of Driving Instruction in Ireland" which was prepared by my Department in consultation with the Road Safety Authority.  Submissions from stakeholders were sought by the 8 September 2006.  Submissions have been received and are being considered by the RSA.In the document it was proposed that from 1 July 2007 all new entrants to the driving instruction industry must be approved and registered before being allowed to instruct for reward and that existing driving instructors must be approved and registered by 1 July 2008.

As well as the continuation of grant assistance for essential safety and security capital expenditure under the NDP, all regional airports are eligible for capital expenditure grants where demand for additional air services can be demonstrated and where an economic case can be made to justify increased investment.At my Department's request, all of the regional airports including Ireland West Airport Knock have submitted proposals for funding under the new scheme.  These grant applications will be assessed and prioritised by my Department with the assistance of expert advice and I expect to be in a position to announce each airport's allocation under the scheme by the end of November this year.

I am advised by the IAA that they rigorously enforce the relevant regulations through ongoing surveillance of Irish airlines.  The IAA conducts a series of audits on flight time limitations in all Irish airlines to ensure compliance with current regulations and approved flight time limitations schemes (typically every six months).  I understand that in 2005 in excess of 3,500 individual records were examined on this topic alone.The IAA is subject to routine audits by the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO), the Joint Aviation Authority (JAA), the Department of Transport and IAA internal audits which verify IAA effectiveness in this regard.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	579	Since 13 September 2006 as a consequence of the Road Safety Authority (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 responsibility for matters relating to vehicle standards, including requirements in relation to mirrors on vehicles, has passed to the Road Safety Authority.  Prior to the Road Safety Authority taking over the responsibility for these matters, I had made considerable progress on the issue of the voluntary fitting of vision-enhancing mirrors to HGVs and buses and I have no doubt that the Road Safety Authority will continue in that vein  working with the motor trade and other stakeholders to ensure best practice in relation to these critically important motor components.I am favourably disposed, as is the Road Safety Authority, to the compulsory fitment of cyclops mirrors to existing HGVs and buses.  However, before such a requirement could be introduced it would be necessary for a regulatory impact assessment of the proposal to be carried out and for the European Commission to be consulted.  The RSA has indicated to me that it will soon embark on undertaking such an assessment of the proposal and will prepare, for public consultation, a draft regulation to bring about a compulsory situation, which the Authority may submit to me in due course.

The Authority will be seeking the views of the Technical Advisory Forum for the National Car Test (NCT) on the matter.  The establishment of an Advisory Forum body to consider and make recommendations to the RSA in relation to vehicle technical matters associated with the NCT regime was recommended in the report of the mid-term review of the national car testing service.I understand from the Authority that it will shortly be seeking nominations from relevant organisations and stakeholders to serve on the forum and that it expects the forum to be constituted in the next few weeks.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 53 and 56 together.It is my objective to eliminate the backlog of driving tests by mid-2007.  That means having a waiting list of no more than about 50,000 that can be scheduled in a 10 to 12 week period.  The Road Safety Authority now has responsibility for the delivery of driving tests and will be working towards this objective.The measures I have put in place to achieve this objective are: the redeployment of seven civil servants from the Department of Agriculture and Food as driver testers in April this year giving an annual additional capacity of about 10,000 tests; the recruitment of eleven driver testers on 2-year contracts who will provide additional capacity of about 15,000 tests in a full year; the introduction of a bonus scheme for driver testers from February, 2006 which has the potential to deliver up to 40,000 driving tests; and the outsourcing of a block of 40,000 tests to an outside agency which can be extended to 45,000 tests if necessary.SGS Ltd., the company contracted to conduct driving tests, commenced issuing driving test appointment letters to test candidates during the week commencing 11 September.  SGS Ltd. will begin conducting driving tests during the week commencing 23 October.I expect to see a marked reduction in the waiting list by the end of this year.  I also expect that the Road Safety Authority to formally review the position, taking account of all the above measures and take any action necessary to ensure a reduction in the waiting times in line with my objective.In relation to demand forecasting a statistical forecasting model for driving test applications from 2000 to 2006 has been in use.  Applications received were within range for the years up to 2003.  In 2003, applications rose to a record level for a short period.  It is this spike in applications that has caused the backlog in the testing system.  Since then applications have returned to within predicted range.  The Road Safety Authority will be preparing demand forecasts into the future.

This was confirmed recently in Towards 2016, the new Partnership Agreement.Transport 21 provides for the re-opening of the corridor on a phased basis, in line with the recommendations of the Report by the Expert Working Group on the Western Rail Corridor Chaired by Mr. Pat McCann.  The Ennis to Athenry section is to be completed in 2008, the Athenry to Tuam section in 2011 and the Tuam to Claremorris section in 2014.The current situation is that on Tuesday last, I announced Government approval for funding of approx €100m for the development of the first phase of the Western Rail Corridor from Ennis to Athenry, which is expected to cost approx €100m at 2005 prices.  I have asked Irish Rail to proceed now with the detailed planning and design of the project, with a view to commencing track renewal in mid-2007 and completing the project in 2008.I also announced that, subject to some further studies to be completed by Irish Rail, the Government has approved funding in principle for the development of phase 2 of the corridor between Athenry and Tuam, scheduled for completion by 2011.In relation to phase 3 of the project, the development of the section from Tuam to Claremorris, I expect to receive business case proposals from Irish Rail at the appropriate time and in accordance with the timetable announced under Transport 21.In addition, on 18 September last, my Cabinet colleague Minister Ó Cuív announced that funding for the preservation of the Claremorris to Collooney section of the corridor would be provided under the Clár Programme.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I have no direct responsibility in relation to setting of motor insurance premiums.  Insurance cover is provided based on actuarial or statistical data or other underwriting or commercial factors.It would be important to recognise at the outset that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board award compensation at the same level as the Courts.  However the legal costs are substantially lower than processing a claim through the courts.  The insurance industry points out that through their own research and using Central Statistic Office data, insurance premiums are now, in real terms, lower than at any time since 1992.As stated earlier, motor insurance companies use a range of factors when assessing risk and arriving at different categories of insurance premiums.  Penalty points are one such factor.  The industry acknowledge the following criteria among their rating factor — age, gender, type of driving licence, claims experience, class of use, vehicle engine cc as well as other criteria.  The Department understands that some motor insurers use penalty points as a specific rating factor, whereas others take a more general approach of acknowledging the effects of penalty points on the overall claims costs and price premiums accordingly.The Government for its part initiated the Insurance Reform Programme in 2002 which has been very successful in bringing down the cost and increasing the availability of motor insurance.  Between April 2003 and August 2006, overall motor insurance premiums have fallen by some 28.5 percent.  The recommendations contained in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board's report form the bedrock of the insurance reform programme which my Department is implementing.  The operation of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and anti-fraud measures incorporated in the Courts and Civil Liability Act have already improved the environment for lower costs of claims resulting from personal injury claims and compensation.  Random breath testing, increased resources to the Garda Traffic Corps and the roll-out of the penalty points system are also expected to deliver better driver behaviour and reduced frequency of traffic collisions.

Instead the NRA is separately procuring a barrier free toll system, which will become operational in 2008.  NTR will be compensated in accordance with the existing West-Link Agreement.The exact details of the arrangements, including compensation, remain to be finalised between NRA and NTR and as these discussions are ongoing at present, I would not wish to pre-empt their outcome.In relation to barrier free tolling legislation, my officials are currently preparing proposals for a Roads Amendment Bill 2006 to strengthen the statutory basis.  I hope to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas before the end of this year.

I understand from the Authority that the response to the campaign to date is very encouraging and that it has already brought about a  significantly increase in public awareness of the need for children to be properly and safely restrained in motor vehicles.  As a follow on from the awareness programme, the Authority will be conducting surveys in due course to determine awareness levels and seating wearing compliance by the public in relation to the use of safety belts and child restraint systems in motor vehicles.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	590	At the outset, I should explain that overall responsibility for the planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the Dublin Port Tunnel, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the local authorities concerned, in this case, Dublin City Council.  I understand from the NRA that the estimated cost of the Tunnel remains at €751 million, which has been the estimate for some time.As regards the opening of the Tunnel, I understand that the main construction and installation work in the Tunnel was completed in July.  The latest indication from Dublin City Council and the NRA is that the Tunnel will open later this year.  However, in the interest of public safety, the exact opening date will be contingent on satisfactory completion of the testing and commissioning of the Tunnel's operational and safety features, including the training of operational and emergency services staff.My Department is keeping in touch with all stakeholders, including the NRA and Dublin City Council, on a regular basis to ensure that a co-ordinated strategy is developed for the opening of the Tunnel.

The text was unanimously endorsed at the December 2005 Transport Council subject to sufficient progress by the US side on opening up ownership and control of US airlines to EU investors.  The formal US process of changing its ownership and control rules was expected to be concluded in August 2006 so that a final decision could be taken at the October Transport Council.  However, due to difficulties on the US side the rule-making process has been extended.I am fully committed to the view that the liberalisation of air transport services between Ireland and the US will deliver major benefits for Irish business and tourism.  I have written to EU Commissioner Barrot strongly urging the Commission to continue engagement with the US Authorities so that they can be in a position to bring forward a proposal for decision at the October Transport Council that will incorporate the Irish transition arrangements.  In the absence of progress at EU level I intend to seek to implement, in accordance with the applicable Community law, the essential elements of the transitional arrangements by way of an amendment to the Ireland-US bilateral Air Services Agreement.

I understand from the Railway Procurement Agency that it is currently in the alignment identification stage of each of these projects and is studying these routes in partnership with the relevant local authorities.  Once final alignments have been agreed RPA will seek the implementation of development levies to support each project.Section 49 of the Planning & Development Act, 2000, provides for the drawing up of supplementary development contribution schemes by Local Authorities in order to facilitate a particular public infrastructure service or project.  Such development levy schemes can be used for rail, light rail metro or other public transport infrastructure and can help to bring forward the delivery of these projects.  A development levy scheme has already been introduced by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in respect of the proposed Luas extension from Sandyford to Cherrywood.  A similar scheme has been introduced by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority under its own legislation in respect of the proposed Luas extension from Connolly Station to the Point.

I understand that the majority of the 34 county councils and city councils have either completed a review of existing speed limits, have a review underway at present or are planning to carry out such a review later in 2006, pursuant to section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, with a view to adopting new by-laws.All 34 local authorities indicated that the special speed limit by-laws that were in place prior to 20 January 2005 were still applicable.  Five of the authorities indicated that new additional by-laws had been adopted since January 2005 to apply special speed limits at further locations.  My Department will continue to monitor this situation to ensure that the local authorities follow through on their stated intentions as outlined above.

To facilitate the formulation of a national biofuels policy, that Department has established an inter-Departmental Biofuels Group, in which my Department participates.  My Department is committed to delivering a sustainable transport system designed to balance economic, social and environmental considerations in the development and delivery of transport policy.  A range of policies and measures are being progressed which will facilitate the promotion of biofuels in the transport sector.The CIE companies have committed to regular reporting to my Department on the progress made towards the substitution of fossil fuel with biofuel alternatives.  Dublin Bus is currently piloting the use of 5% biodiesel blend in five vehicles in Dublin and Bus Éireann intends to commence a pilot of 5% biofuel blend in Cork in the near future.Transport 21 provides funding for a range of sustainable transport initiatives.  The purpose of these initiatives is to facilitate the mainstreaming of sustainability criteria into transport investment decision-making and to make cleaner, more environmentally-friendly vehicles available.  These initiatives include pilot projects to test the feasibility of biofuel use in public transport bus operations and HGVs.  The projects will build on the initiatives already underway in Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann and the results will be used to guide future policy development, particularly in relation to public transport investment.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The Report of the Inquiry into the Derailment of a Freight Train at Cahir was published on the 3 August, 2006.  The implementation of the recommendations of the report is a matter for Iarnród Éireann and the Railway Safety Commission.  I understand from both the Railway Safety Commission and Iarnród Éireann that the latter is implementing the recommendations which focus on strengthening Iarnród Éireann's inspection and maintenance regime and its safety management systems.  The Railway Safety Commissioner has advised my Department that he is satisfied that Iarnród Éireann are implementing the recommendations but he will continue to track overall implementation of the recommendations on an ongoing basis.Most of the recommendations are being carried out and funded under the €512m Railway Safety Programme for the period 2004-2008.  In relation to railway safety generally, the position is that this Government has prioritised investment in Railway Safety since 1999 and total investment over the period 1999 to date amounts to over €850m.  This investment is providing a twofold benefit for passengers: a safer railway as well as better and more frequent passenger services.  Since 1999, Iarnród Éireann has renewed approximately 760 kilometres of track, erected over 500 kilometres of new fencing, replaced and/or renewed over 170 bridges and closed or upgraded over 750 level crossings.Other elements of the safety programme included investment in signals, telecommunications and electrification as well as in cuttings and embankments.  The development of the company's safety management systems has also been addressed with over €80m expended on improving the safety management systems, procedures and practices and in promoting safety culture at all levels in the organisation.As part of Transport 21, investment in railway safety will be maintained at a high level to ensure full implementation of the railway safety programme recommended by the Task Force on Railway Safety.  In addition to the increased investment, the establishment of the Railway Safety Commission on 1 January, 2006 under the provisions of the Railway Safety Act, 2005 has provided a modern regulatory framework for railway safety.  Increased investment combined with a modern legislative framework for railway safety will ensure a continuing high level of safety across the railway network.

The pension scheme in question, the Irish Airlines (General Employees) Superannuation Scheme, is a multi-employer scheme in which these two companies and Aer Lingus participate.  Under the rules of the Scheme indexation increases are not guaranteed and are not explicitly funded but depend on the performance of the pension fund and are paid at the discretion of the Trustees of the Scheme.  I understand, however, that the practice by the Trustees has been to provide pension increases in line with CPI.The provisions made in relation to Aer Lingus are particular to that company and were agreed in the context of the overall arrangements put in place for the Aer Lingus IPO.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	603	The Government is committed to promoting cycling, as is made clear in the Programme for Government: "We will invest in expanding the national network of cycleways in order to encourage more people to cycle and to promote cycling as a safe and healthy mode of travel" — Programme for Government, Page 14, June 2002.  It is Government policy to make provision for the bicycle as a separate mode in the design and maintenance of roads.While the provision of cycle ways and cycle parking is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant local authorities, my Department provides funding for cycle facility provision by local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), through its Traffic Management Grants (TMG) Scheme, which is administered by the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO). €45m was set aside for Traffic Management Grants this year.  Allocations are made to individual projects based upon proposals from local authorities and in order of priority based upon a multi-criteria analysis.  The development of cycle facilities also takes place in conjunction with the implementation of bus priority schemes.  Approximately €30m has been provided by the Exchequer for the provision of cycling facilities in the Greater Dublin Area since 1994, €1m of which was provided in 2005.  €2.2m has been allocated for cycle facilities in 2006.  Overall, there are now approximately 300 kms of cycle network in the GDA.The DTO cycletrack design manual (Provision of Cycling Facilities: National Manual for Urban Areas), published in 1997, provides guidance on the design of cycle facilities in Ireland.  It is available on the DTO website  at www.dto.ie/web2006/chapter1.pdf.  The manual is supplemented by the DTO Traffic Management Guidelines, published in September 2003 in conjunction with the Department of Transport and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.A new edition of the DTO cycle manual is now being drafted by the DTO, which will address, inter alia: Compatibility and integration with the DTO Traffic Management Guidelines 2003, especially in the area of road hierarchy, road layouts, parking etc.  Clarifications in relation to legislation etc.  Design-specific issues such as cycling and bus stops, cycle parking development, roundabout detailing, cycling and trams, cycling and trucks, cycling and bus lanes.  Expanded junction design guidance.The DTO Steering Committee adopted a Cycle Policy for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) at its September 2006 meeting.  The Cycle Policy is a statement of intent by the Dublin Local Authorities, the DTO and other members of the DTO Steering Committee.  The policy proposes to enhance the cycling environment in the GDA and promote cycling by a variety of means, including creating a continuous cycle-friendly environment on cycle routes and training and education measures.  The GDA cycling strategy will now be further developed by the establishment of a GDA Cycle Working Group, consisting of local authorities and other relevant implementing/funding agencies.  Partnerships will be formed with other stakeholders as necessary.Outside of Dublin, the framework for the promotion of cycling in the regional cities is set out in the relevant land use and transportation strategy or in the relevant Development Plan or Local Area Plan.  The Cork Area Strategic Plan contains proposals to improve facilities for cyclists and promote safe cycling in the city, and Cork City Council has since also developed a cycle network strategy.  In Galway, the City Development Plan includes proposals for improving facilities for cyclists.  Limerick City Council approved a cycle strategy for Limerick in May 2004, while the Waterford City Development Plan includes proposals for improving facilities for cyclists.The most significant development of cycle facilities in the Regional Cities, funded by my Department, has arisen as a consequence of the development of Green Routes, QBCs and bus lanes in those cities.  Cork City Council is in the process of developing ten Green Routes, including cycling facilities, with funding from my Department.  It is anticipated that the most significant development of cycle facilities in Galway in the near future will arise as a consequence of the development of bus lanes recommended by the Strategic Galway Bus Study.  This study, funded by my Department, is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.  In the case of Limerick, my Department is funding a Green Route programme including the provision of cycling facilities, which form part of a planned integrated cycle network for Limerick.  Waterford City Council, with funding from my Department, engaged consultants to prepare reports and to carry out design for the Waterford City N25 and Dunmore Road Green Routes.  These projects will include provision for cycling facilities.The staff in my Department's Accessibility, Rural Transport and Traffic Management Division, deal directly with the DTO and Local Authorities outside the Greater Dublin Area on traffic management matters, including cycling policy.  No one individual is dedicated solely to cycling policy.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS), published by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2000, sets out Ireland's approach to meeting its Kyoto Protocol target of reducing national greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels by 2008-2012.  A review of this document was published for public consultation in July 2006.  The published Paper reviews the progress to date and also identifies a range of other measures, including measures in the transport sector, that might be considered for inclusion in the new Strategy which is to be published in the near future.My Department is already pursuing a number of measures to control the growth of greenhouse gas emissions from transport, including a commitment to sustainability as a key objective in the Statement of Strategy 2005-2007.Transport 21 will promote modal shift from private cars to public transport through significant rebalancing of investment in favour of public transport.  The completion of projects identified in Transport 21 will see public transport capacity in the Greater Dublin Area almost double over its ten-year implementation period.  In addition, major investment will take place in the national rail network, with improved and more frequent inter-city rail services, the development of the Western Rail Corridor and the Cork suburban rail network.  There will also be significant investment in regional and local bus services.Funding for a range of sustainable transport initiatives is also provided under Transport 21.  The purpose of these initiatives is to facilitate the mainstreaming of sustainability criteria into transport investment decision-making and to make cleaner, more environmentally-friendly vehicles available, embracing public transport, the haulage industry and taxis.  Pilot projects will be carried out to test the potential of biofuels, hybrid-electric technologies and eco-driving.Technological developments can improve the fuel economy, and therefore emissions, of passenger cars.  Ireland supports the EU Voluntary Agreements negotiated between the Commission and the car manufacturing industry to progressively reduce CO2 emissions from new passenger cars.  Complementary to this, optimal vehicle operation enhances fuel efficiency.  The National Car Test, which was introduced in 2000, facilitates improved vehicle maintenance.Tackling transport emissions requires a cross-Departmental approach involving a number of Government Departments.  I am determined to ensure that my Department will continue to play its part in ensuring that the transport sector makes its contribution to the important task of controlling national greenhouse gas emissions.

There are no plans to prohibit the use on public roads of cars first registered prior to 1 January 1992 not having rear safety belts.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	606	At the outset, I should explain that overall responsibility for the planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the Dublin Port Tunnel, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the local authorities concerned.  I have no function in relation to the day-to-day operation of these projects.As with all major infrastructure projects Cost Benefit Analysis was carried out by the NRA in line with Department of Finance investment appraisal guidelines.  In light of traffic growth in the Dublin area in recent years there are no indications that the conclusions of that Cost Benefit Analysis have significantly altered.  In line with Department of Finance guidelines, a post-completion Cost Benefit Analysis will be carried out in due course.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The Road Traffic Acts provides that a member of the Garda Síochána may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample which will then be subject to analysis by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.The Medical Bureau of Road Safety continues to analyse blood and urine specimens received under the Road Traffic Acts for the presence of a drug or drugs.  In 2004, 569 specimens were tested for the presence of a drugs or drugs.  354 specimens tested positive and 215 were found to be negative for the presence of a drug or drugs.There is no feasible basis for the introduction of a scheme of preliminary roadside testing for drugs at present.  However, screening devices based on oral fluid specimens are being developed for the purpose of carrying out roadside drug testing.  Such testing devices are in prototype stages and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in this area.The Bureau undertook a two-year research programme of drug analysis of blood and urine samples in 2001 and 2002.  The complete confirmatory results of the survey identifies trends in the types of drugs being taken, their combination with alcohol, and the incidence of polydrug use.  The confirmation analysis of specimens continued in 2003 and the data collection and report was published in June 2004.The study indicates that 15.7% of all tested drivers were positive for one or more drugs; that of the drivers who were under the limit for alcohol, 33.1% were positive for one or more drugs; and that of the drivers with very low or zero levels of alcohol, 67.9% were positive for drugs.The offence of driving under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent that the driver is incapable of having proper control of the vehicle attracts a disqualification of not less than 2 years in the case of a first offence, and, not less than 4 years in the case of a second or any subsequent offence.  The courts can also impose a fine of up to €2,500 and/or 6 months in jail.In the case of a 2 year disqualification a person can only apply for a review of the period after the expiry of 9 months and  one year of the disqualification must be served.  Where a disqualification order is made for a period of 4 years, the request for a review may not be made until a period of 21 months has expired and the period of disqualification cannot be reduced to less than 2 years.

The Authority will examine what information is currently available and what information is required on road traffic accidents from all the relevant Departments and Agencies, including the Gardaí.  This may include the extension of the collection of data on matters raised by the Deputy.  The Deputies' enquiry has been forwarded to the Road Safety Authority for direct reply.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	609	The Taxi Regulation Act 2003 established the Commission for Taxi Regulation as the independent body responsible for the development and maintenance of the regulatory framework for the control and operation of small public service vehicles, including taxis, and their drivers.  One of the specific objectives given to the Commission in the 2003 Act is to promote access to small public service vehicles by people with disabilities.The Commission for Taxi Regulation has published a detailed Action Plan 2006-2007, Driving Forward, which sets out a range of changes the Commission proposes to make over the next two years in relation to the control and regulation of taxis, hackneys and limousines and their drivers.  Among the specific proposals being developed by the Commission are measures aimed at improving accessibility.  I understand that a further consultation process will be undertaken later this year by the Commission in relation to vehicle standards, with a particular emphasis on improving accessibility.My Department's Sectoral Plan for Accessible Transport under the Disability Act 2006 was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 20th of July 2006, as required by the Act.  The Plan sets out a programme for action on accessibility in a number of key transport areas, including the taxi and hackney sector.  The plan in particular sets out actions for increasing the accessibility, availability and affordability of small public service vehicles for people with mobility, sensory and cognitive impairments.  These actions will be progressed by the Commission for Taxi Regulation in consultation with the Department of Transport and disability organisations.Data in relation to the overall number of taxis licensed to operate and the percentage of that total that are wheelchair accessible taxis would be available from the Commission for Taxi Regulation.On 5 May 2006 I made Regulations entitled the European Communities (Compulsory Use of Safety Belts and Child Restraint Systems in Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2006 transposing into Irish law Directive 2003/20/EC relating to the compulsory wearing of safety belts and child restraint systems in motor vehicles.The Directive provides that, in general, children who are less than 150 centimetres in height and 36 kilograms in weight must be restrained by an appropriate child restraint when travelling in cars and goods vehicles.  The Directive gives Member States the option to allow children to travel without child restraints in the rear of small public service vehicles if restraints are not available.  In allowing for such arrangements, the Directive recognises that child restraint systems come in a number of different weight classes and that it would not be reasonable to expect drivers of these vehicles to always have the appropriate child restraint available in their vehicles.  For that reason, in making the Regulations to transpose the Directive into Irish law, the option in the Directive permitting children to travel without child restraints in the rear of small public service vehicles was reluctantly exercised.Notwithstanding the legal position, it would be my desire that owners of small public service vehicles would endeavour to provide child restraints in so far as it is practicable to do so.  To that end, I have written to the Commissioner for Taxi Regulation requesting that he engage with the industry with a view to devising guidelines on best practice in relation to the carrying of children in small public service vehicles.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	610	The Government's Ports Policy Statement, which I launched early last year, aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs.  One of the key challenges that lie ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade (LoLo and RoRo).  The Policy Statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a coordinated manner.As part of this process, my Department appointed in September 2005 a firm of consultants expert in this field, Fisher Associates, to help determine whether the anticipated capacity requirement to 2014 and beyond can be efficiently and adequately met through the successful advancement and implementation by the port sector of some combination of the various proposals currently under development in the sector.Detailed submissions outlining proposals for new capacity for unitised trade were received from the following ports and evaluated by Fisher Associates: Cork, Greenore, Dublin, Drogheda, Rosslare, Shannon Foynes and Waterford.The final report of Fisher Associates was completed in June 2006 and its conclusions were noted by the Government in July 2006.  It is intended to publish the broad conclusions of the report in an Information Paper shortly, which will be available on my Department's website at www.transport.ie.In summary, the study concludes that there is currently significant available capacity for LoLo traffic at Irish ports.  Current available capacity for RoRo traffic also exists, although less so than in the case of LoLo.  The conclusions of the study clearly demonstrate that the projects being progressed by the ports sector have the potential to deliver adequate capacity going forward, in line with the Government's Ports Policy.I can assure the Deputy that my Department will closely monitor the progress of these proposals, and for its part will certainly do what is necessary to ensure the statutory and other corporate governance requirements are dealt with expeditiously.  If there is a sound business case for these projects, both the Minister and Minister for Finance as shareholders in the State owned port companies will be positively disposed towards them.While the Government, both as shareholder and policy maker, has a clear interest in ensuring the provision of adequate, cost effective port capacity going forward, the development of the necessary capital projects is primarily a matter for the individual port companies and their boards.  This is in line with the commercial mandate given to the port companies under the Harbours Act 1996.

For technical reasons the direct transfer could not take place until all manual receipts generated by the former manual receipt system operated by the Gardaí had been dealt with.  This process is now almost complete and I understand that direct electronic transfer of data from an Garda Síochána to the National Driver File will commence shortly.There is no direct link between the Garda PULSE system and the penalty point database as it is not necessary for a Garda to know how many penalty points are on a person's record.  Where a person reaches 12 points and is disqualified the Gardaí are notified and this information is entered on the PULSE system.

My Department has been working on the revision of that publication.  There has been a very considerable amount of work involved in that many significant changes in the overall area of road traffic law have to be reflected in the revised booklet.  The draft document was placed on the Department's website for consultation in June 2006.Submissions received have now been considered and a draft of the new booklet is being finalised for transmission within the next few weeks to the Road Safety Authority for design and publication.Design and printing will of itself take a number of weeks to complete but the updated document will be made available on the Department's website during this period.In addition to the new booklet being made available for sale, it will also be made available on-line by the Road Safety Authority.  The Authority will ensure that, in the future, the booklet will provide up-to-date information on changes in traffic law and other requirements on an ongoing basis.With regards to driver training material, the Road Safety Authority, which has taken over responsibility for the functions of the National Safety Council in relation to advertising, education and recommendations regarding road safety policy, launched the "Better, Safer, Driver" campaign in April 2006, which seeks to educate road users on various aspects within the rules of the road booklet.

This ensures a concentrated and visible Garda presence in the area.  These patrols are in addition to the normal complement of community Gardaí permanently allocated to this area.  In addition, a dedicated patrol van with uniformed Gardaí patrols the area between 8 pm and 5 am every Friday and Saturday night.  These patrols are backed up by the Divisional Crime Task Force, District Detective Units and the Divisional Drug Units which also actively patrol the area.I am further informed that Operation Assist, which provides additional patrols by Garda Mounted and Dog Units in support of District and Divisional Units, is also in place in the area since 1 August, 2006.I understand that seven persons have been arrested and charged with a total of 157 offences of the type referred to.

In addition there are six (6) Mountain Bikes deployed on operational duties in Store Street Garda Station of which three (3) exclusively patrol the  East Wall area.I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Store Street Garda Station will be given the fullest consideration.

MAT checkpoints may be established only under written authorisation of a member of An Garda Síochána not below the rank of Inspector.  An authorisation shall be in writing and shall specify the date on which, and the public place in which, the checkpoint is to be established and the hours at any time between which it is operated.Section 4 confers a statutory power to administer the breathalyser to a motorist stopped at a MAT checkpoint without a member of An Garda Síochána being required to form an opinion that the motorist has consumed alcohol, been involved in a collision or breached a provision of the Road Traffic Acts.This statutory power is without prejudice to any powers conferred on a member of An Garda Síochána by statute or at common law.  These include the power under section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 (as inserted by the Road Traffic Act 2003) to require a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place to provide a breath specimen where in the opinion of a member of An Garda Síochána, the person, inter alia, is or has, with the vehicle, been involved in a collision.As this power is discretionary, any policy to breathalyse all drivers involved in road traffic collisions would restrict the exercise of a discretionary power.I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is their policy to make the fullest use of all legislative powers in investigating the commission of offences, including road traffic offences.

This is not just an aspiration.  I am providing and will continue to provide the necessary resources for this to happen.  In relation to protective equipment generally, I am of the view that in facing the dangers that they do on our streets members of the Force need protective and defensive equipment commensurate with  that risk.  In that regard, I wish to inform the Deputy that in relation to "Body Armour", the Garda Síochána, has issued Requests for Tender (RFTs) for the supply and delivery of  12,500 Anti Stab/Ballistic Vests and 3,000 Retractable Batons.  There is also a provision in these RFTs to purchase a further 4,700 vests  and a further 12,000 Batons, if required, over the duration of the contract.  Contracts are due to be signed in the very near future for the supply of these items and it is expected that the delivery will commence shortly thereafter.An Garda Síochána constantly evaluate all available technology with a view to determining the technology best suited to their needs.  Significant resources are being invested in technology for the Gardaí to assist them in the exercise of all their functions.  The capital allocation for IT in 2006 is €33.323 million representing an increase of €5.065 (18%) on the 2005 outturn.  One aspect of technology I am particularly committed to is the delivery of a state-of-the-art digital radio service for An Garda Síochána.  To this end, the procurement of an outsourced Managed Service by the Department of Finance on behalf of An Garda Síochána, other blue light services and some non-commercial public bodies, is well underway.  While the exact timeframe for roll-out will be subject to contract negotiations with the successful bidder, the implementation of the new service is planned to commence later this year.  The total allocation for communications for 2006 is €12.9 million.I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the total number of vehicles by category in the Garda Fleet, excluding vehicles in the Ministerial Fleet,  is as set out in the tables hereunder:CarsVansBikes4x4’sM/BusesLorriesTotal571147199574061,020CarsVansBikes4x4’sM/BusesLorriesTotal96310021341601,134As regards civilian resources, there are already over 1,850 civilians working with An Garda Síochána, including approximately 835 (whole time equivalent) clerical support staff in Garda stations across the country, in Garda HQ and in National Support Services in Harcourt Square.  I should add that I have this week received formal sanction from the Minister for Finance for an additional 76 civilian clerical and administrative support staff to be distributed around the country.  These will be recruited at the earliest opportunity.  In addition, I should mention the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) in Castlebar, which is now almost fully operational with some 150 civilian staff now employed there out of a sanctioned total of 160.  Recruitment of the remaining staff is currently under way.  The GISC allows Gardaí who would otherwise have to return to their Stations to input data on the PULSE system, to log the information with the GISC, while remaining on the beat.  This frees up very significant amounts of Garda time for continued operational duty.  The Garda authorities are already considering what other tasks could be devolved to the GISC which would release additional Garda resources to front-line policing.  The more detailed information sought by the Deputy requires compilation and I will write to the Deputy as soon as, and to the extent to which, the information is available.

An invoice for €850,000, being the first instalment due, has recently issued by the Garda authorities to the Ryder Cup organisation.  A project code was established by An Garda Síochána to capture the costs associated with the policing of the 2006 Ryder Cup.  A total costing of this event will not be available until all expenditure claims have been processed.  Due to the large volume of claims involved and the fact that the Ryder Cup only concluded on Sunday last, 24 September, it will be a number of weeks before this information is to hand.I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.

Seventy-seven (77) Garda members of the GNIB are assigned to Dublin Airport. A further ten (10) are assigned to immigration control duties at Dún Laoghaire Port.  In addition, there are a total of 455 other members of An Garda Síochána, 253 full-time and 202 on a part-time basis, appointed as Immigration officers and engaged on immigration control duties at the land border with Northern Ireland and at other Ports of Entry to the State, other than Dublin Airport and Dún Laoghaire Port.  These members are Divisional resources in the Garda Division where the land border or Port of Entry is located.  An additional pier is under construction at Dublin Airport and is to be completed by late 2007, while a proposed second terminal is expected to be operational in the second half of 2009. Enhanced immigration facilities will be a feature in both terminals and Garda management at the GNIB will liaise with the Dublin Airport Authority in this regard.

The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that following negotiations between the Ryder Cup organisation and An Garda Síochána it was agreed that an amount of €1.7m would be paid by that organisation towards the cost of policing the 2006 Ryder Cup.  An invoice for €850,000, being the first instalment due, has recently issued by the Garda authorities to the Ryder Cup organisation.  A project code was established by An Garda Síochána to capture the costs associated with the policing of the 2006 Ryder Cup.  A total costing of this event will not be available until all expenditure claims have been processed.  Due to the large volume of claims involved and the fact that the Ryder Cup only concluded on Sunday last, 24 September, it will be a number of weeks before this information is to hand.I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Divisions will be given the fullest consideration.

I would point out that the Division's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.

The Deputy will be aware that applications of this type are dealt with in chronological order.  This application will be considered by my Department and a decision will issue in due course.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	662	The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 contains provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour.  The Act empowers a senior member of the Garda Síochána to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner.  In relation to children aged 12 to 18 years, specially tailored provisions, fully integrated into the Children Act 2001, provide for a number of steps. These culminate in court orders for those engaged in anti-social behaviour.The relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 will be commenced following consultations between my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  Section 1(3) of the Act makes specific provision to this effect.  The purpose of this is to ensure that these provisions will only be commenced after the Commissioner has had the opportunity to make the necessary internal arrangements to ensure the smooth introduction of these new procedures.I want to emphasise again that separate provision is being made in relation to young people.  The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 introduces provisions for behaviour orders for children aged 12 to 18 years into the Children Act, 2001 and the protections of that Act will apply.  There has to be a series of incremental stages, with parental involvement, preceding an application for a behaviour order.  These include a warning, a good behaviour contract and referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.  Only after these stages can a behaviour order be sought through the Courts.  In addition to new administrative procedures within the Garda Síochána, behaviour orders require changes to the existing Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme provided for in the Children Act, 2001.

Following this, a nationwide advertising and recruitment campaign, for both Garda Reserve trainees and full-time Garda trainees, was launched on 14 August 2006.  The recruitment campaign for full-time trainees closed on 19 September 2006.  Recruitment for the Garda Reserve will continue indefinitely.Recruitment for the Garda Reserve is being carried out by the Public Appointments Service.  Applications are being accepted by both internet and phone.  The total number of applicants for the Garda Reserve at 19 September was 6,661.  A full county by county analysis of internet applications is not yet available from the Public Appointments Service.  However, of the 3,664 phone applications, the breakdown by county is as set out in the table below.NumberCarlow57Cavan62Clare112Cork376Donegal104Dublin907Galway195Kerry115Kildare180Kilkenny82Laois83Leitrim25Limerick121Longford41Louth125Mayo114Meath184Monaghan38Offaly78Roscommon77Sligo72Tipperary133Waterford77Westmeath104Wexford102Wicklow92Northern Ireland8Total3,664These figures demonstrate the significant level of public interest in the Garda Reserve and the willingness of people to serve their local communities.The process of selecting suitable candidates has already commenced.  Interviews for the first tranche of reserve trainees were held from 12 September and medical examinations for candidates began last weekend.  Candidates for the Garda Reserve are required to go through the same vetting process as full-time applicants and the process is underway.In conjunction with this, senior members of An Garda Síochána have planned for training, equipping and deploying members of the Reserve.  The first group of trainees is to commence Phase One training in the Garda College in Templemore this Saturday, 30 September.  Reserve members will receive more than 120 hours initial training which will be in accordance with the best international standard.  Training will consist of a comprehensive training programme of five phases as follows:Phase One is a two day induction course which will give Reserve members an appreciation of the Garda Organisation and its culture.Phase Two will consist of 56 hours training at evenings/weekends over an eight week period during which the trainee Reserve members will learn basic law and Garda procedures.Phase Three is two days during which the trainee Reserve members will engage in role play exercises including radio procedures and be instructed in self defence, handcuff techniques and use of equipment.Phase Four is a minimum of 40 hours at a nominated Garda Station during which the Trainee Reserve members will engage in accompanied beat patrol with a full-time Garda and Station duty under a Station Sergeant.Phase Five is a one day graduation at the Garda College.It is anticipated that the first group of trainees will be assigned to five different Garda stations throughout the State.  These are: Sligo, Mill Street in Galway, Anglesea Street in Cork, Pearse Street, Dublin 2 and Store Street, Dublin 1.  Once the full county by county analysis of applications is available from the Public Appointments Service further locations will be identified for deployment.

This classification now means that Weston has controlled airspace in conjunction with Dublin and Baldonnel airports.  This reclassification does not change the type or size of aircraft currently capable of using Weston.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there have been no alterations to the Conditions of Approval granted to Weston Ltd by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has responsibility for the collection of all import duties and the enforcement of prohibitions or restrictions which may apply at import.  In particular the Office has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, and seizure of controlled drugs at importation.  They have responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry into the State, specifically, at ports, airports, including licensed airfields, and on the land frontier.Control of Weston Aerodrome, and other licensed airfields in the Dublin Region, is carried out by Customs Teams attached to the Dublin Enforcement District.  These are dedicated anti-smuggling teams, which focus on the smuggling of prohibited drugs, and fiscal products.  Other duties undertaken by Officers in attendance at Weston Aerodrome include clearance of aircraft and passengers arriving from third countries, spot checks on EU flights, verification of fuel Drawback Claims, verification of End-Use Authorisations, clearance of aircraft under Transfer of Residence, and checks on private aircraft to ensure compliance with import procedures (new means of transport).In 2004, Officers attached to the Dublin Enforcement District carried out 12 planned and 6 unplanned visits to Weston.  During 2005, 10 planned and 6 unplanned visits; and to-date in 2006, 11 planned and 3 unplanned visits have been made to Weston by Officers from this district.  All Customs operations are risk focused, and staff deployed to combat areas of greatest risk.  The level of activity at Weston Aerodrome is constantly monitored from a risk perspective.  Revenue will, of course, review their risk assessments in light of the reported heroin seizure in Belgium earlier this week involving a Weston-based plane.

The most recent expenditure data on the Plan relates to the period to the end December 2005.  This data is set out in Tables 1 and 2 below.  Data for first six months of 2006 will be available at end October 2006 following the meetings of the Operational Programme Monitoring Committees.Table 1 sets out the indicative total expenditure forecasts and the estimated total expenditure incurred under each Operational Programme in the Border, Midland and Western (BMW) Region for the period January 2000 to December 2005.January 2000 to end December 2005Operational ProgrammeOriginal ProfileEstimated ExpenditureExpenditure versus Profile€m€m%Economic and Social Infrastructure5,8635,43592Employment & Human Resources Development3,6533,44994Productive Sector2,66378629Border, Midlands & Western Regional3,5192,27364PEACE II & Technical Assistance14610974Total Expenditure15,84412,05276Profiles and Expenditure data includes all NDP sources of funding; Exchequer, EU and Private.The Exchequer forecast and estimated Exchequer expenditure incurred under each operational programme in the BMW Region for the period January 2000 to December 2005 is set out in Table 2.January 2000 to end December 2005Operational ProgrammeOriginal ProfileEstimated ExpenditureExpenditure versus Profile€m€m%Economic and Social Infrastructure4,0544,570113Employment and Human Resources Development3,6543,49596Productive Sector1,74160034Border, Midlands & Western Regional2,5661,92075PEACE II & Technical Assistance14610974Total Exchequer Expenditure12,16110,69488It can be seen from the data presented in Table 2 that the Exchequer contribution to the BMW Region under the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme (ESIOP) has exceeded its original target by €516 million to the end of 2005.  However, a complete picture of extra expenditure in the region, over that committed in the lifetime of the NDP, will not be available until the full year expenditure data for 2006 are analysed and reported at the Spring 2007 meetings of the Operational Programme Monitoring Committees.The latest information indicates that overall gross expenditure in the Border, Midlands and West (BMW) region is running at €12.1 billion for the six year period 2000-2005, with the Exchequer component running at €10.7 billion.  The information also indicates that the overall outturn for the NDP is expected to be near to forecast by the end of 2006, but with some over-performance and underperformance of expenditure taking place within the Operational Programmes that support the NDP.  However, it is also expected that co-funded measures under the NDP will achieve their full entitlement to Structural Funds in the BMW Region by the end of 2008, the timetable set out in the Regulations.  So the overall impact will not be available until that time.The Government's commitment to the region does not cease when the current funding round draws to a close.  The new National Development Plan 2007-13, currently in preparation, will build on the achievements already taking place under the Plan.  In addition the BMW region will also receive Structural Funds allocation of €458m under the next round of funding 2007-13.  In that context my Department is also preparing the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) which will set out the strategic orientation of the Funds and link the Community's priorities with the national and regional priorities, and which in turn will assist in the preparation of the relevant Operational Programmes.

Fencing of the Bishopsmeadows site will take place at a later stage owing to other works currently being undertaken in that area by the County Council on the construction of a riverside walk, cycle path and associated works.On the advice of Kilkenny County Council and the wildlife ranger it has been decided not to re-seed the Bishopsmeadows site.  This area is part of an SAC (Special Area of Conservation) and the wildlife ranger has advised that the wild flowers are now getting much better established since the start of the summer and the area is greening up satisfactorily.  It is expected that the area will naturally re-establish itself within a short space of time.  The area along the roadside is being maintained by the County Council and only the area within the Meadows is being left unmaintained as meadow grass.

The fact that the sale is to the local parish has no particular advantages regarding the claw-back of agricultural relief.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that if the previous owner of the land was entitled to relief from capital gains tax (CGT) on its disposal to the current owner, a sale by the current owner, within six years of acquisition, might result in a claw-back of some or all of the that relief.  In such a case the CGT, which would have been charged on the previous owner, is assessed and charged on the current owner.Furthermore, the CGT Acts provides for relief on capital gains arising where an asset is sold to the State or to a charity for a consideration not exceeding the cost of the asset to the owner.  However, more information would be required to decide what would be the result in this case.The Deputy should contact the Revenue Commissioners if he would like more specific information on how the above would apply to the landowner in question.

The Commissioners' responsibilities do not extend to the cleaning and maintenance of the area between the river and peoples properties.  An old silted-up mill race runs through the area between the river bank and the property boundaries of houses in the area in question.  In the past, litter and other debris has accumulated in this area.  During the works on the drainage scheme, the local authority was unable to gain access to this area as the site was in the possession of the contractor undertaking the drainage works.  In these circumstances, the OPW exceptionally arranged for the contractor to clean up the area at that time.

Significant preparatory work is well underway involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  An additional €9m is available to the Executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for the roll out.As part of my response to the Strategy for Cancer Control, I will establish a National Cancer Screening Agency to amalgamate BreastCheck and the ICSP to deliver both programmes nationally.  This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.  The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	694	The research to which the Deputy refers is the study into the ‘Economic burden of cardiovascular diseases in the enlarges EU'; by Leal J, Luengo-Fernández R, Gray A, Petersen S and Rayner M. European Heart Journal, doi: 10. 1093 / eurheartj/ ehi733.As was stated in a previous answer to this question, the authors set out to provide an estimate of the economic costs of cardiovascular disease for EU countries.  It was unclear how some of these costs were estimated and given that the authors may have underestimated the true costs in Ireland, there are question marks about the accuracy of the overall findings as they relate to this country.The Cardiovascular Health Strategy — Building Healthier Hearts — was launched in 1999.  The report makes recommendations about the prevention, treatment and surveillance of coronary heart disease across a number of sectors and the full range of health service activities, in health promotion,  primary care, pre-hospital care, acute hospital services and cardiac rehabilitation.Since 2000 this Government has committed over €63 million towards the implementation of the Strategy.  This funding has supported a wide range of new regional services and initiatives, which have had a measurable impact on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with heart disease.  More than 800 new posts have been created, including 19 additional consultant cardiology posts.Significant progress has been made in addressing the key challenges in the implementation of the Strategy in relation to improving population health, ensuring equitable access to services and  improving the quality of services.  I understand the HSE review of the Cardiovascular Health Strategy is progressing as set out in the service plan for 2006 and my Department will continue to monitor this review.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	695	A breast screening programme is a complex multidisciplinary undertaking that requires considerable expertise and management involving population registers, call/recall systems, mammography, pathology and appropriate treatment and follow up.  A programme must be quality assured and acceptable to women who attend for screening.  The first phase of the programme is of a high quality and a similar quality in the West and South is essential.I have met with representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of my wish to have a quality assured programme rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  For this to happen, essential elements of the roll out must be in place including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes.  I have made additional revenue funding of €2.3m available to BreastCheck to meet the additional costs of roll out.  I have also approved an additional 69 posts.  BreastCheck recently appointed Clinical Directors for the Southern and Western regions and the recruitment of Consultants and other staff is now underway.BreastCheck also requires considerable capital investment in the construction of two new clinical units and in the provision of  five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  I have made available an additional €21m capital funding to BreastCheck for this purpose.  Demolition works at South Infirmary/Victoria University Hospital were completed this month.  The Department has issued approval to BreastCheck to award contracts for the construction of the static units at the South Infirmary/Victoria University Hospital, Cork and University College Hospital Galway.  BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of roll out to the Southern and Western regions will be met.Any proposal received by BreastCheck to support the roll out of its screening programme will be carefully examined to assess the extent to which it complies with existing standards.  BreastCheck recently conducted an evaluation of a proposal from a private screening service and concluded that the clinic in question would not be in a position to provide a screening programme in line with BreastCheck standards.

Of this total, 2222 questions related, in whole or in part, to matters proper to the statutory remit of the HSE and were accordingly referred to the Executive for direct reply.  The Executive has issued replies to 1990 of these Questions and is currently working to issue replies as soon as possible in the case of the remaining 232 Questions, 9 of which were asked by the Deputy.The Executive endeavours to issue final replies to questions within 20 working days.  I have been informed that for the period concerned 1,200 replies issued within this timeframe.  The reasons for a delay in replying to questions may vary.  For instance, questions can differ substantially in relation to the extent of the detail sought either in relation to a national service or in relation to a service over a period of years.  In some cases the preparation of replies may involve decisions of a wider nature such as determining service priorities or resource allocation.  I have been informed that the Executive's Parliamentary Affairs Division has been in touch with the Deputy's office to explain the reason for the delay and to confirm that a reply will issue shortly  in relation to the particular question referred to by him.I am aware that the HSE is actively addressing performance in this area.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	698	Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, provides for charges to be made in respect of inpatient services generally.  In regard to public long-stay care, Section 53 was amended by the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005 to provide for a charge where inpatient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days, or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the pervious 12 months.  This was implemented by the Health (Charges for In-Patients Services) Regulations 2005 which provided for the levying of charges in respect of the maintenance of person in public long-stay care.  Services are not, therefore, free in public units and, in respect of private nursing homes, the financial support given by the State to patients is at present governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and subsequent Regulations, which allow the State to pay a subvention towards the cost of private nursing home care.  The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 does not give statutory entitlement to free nursing home care in either public or private nursing homes.  The Deputy may be aware that the placing of a person in a private nursing home is a private matter between the person or his or her representatives and the nursing home proprietor, as are the fees charged in these facilities.With regard to a person having medical cover, VHI pays nursing home benefit where a VHI member is transferred to a convalescent home listed in its directory of convalescent homes, for up to fourteen days, if the Consultant decides for medical reasons, and their Medical Director agrees, that a person who is a member of VHI needs to stay in a convalescent home immediately after being in hospital for medically necessary treatment, which is eligible for VHI Healthcare benefit.  The benefits payable in respect of convalescent claims depend on the plan held, typically between €45 and €70 per day.  The nursing home cover provided by VHI is in accordance with the prescribed amount of cover insurers are obliged to provide under article 5 and Schedule A of the Minimum Benefit Regulations.

The system is straightforward and is based on a corporation tax rate of 25% applying to profits earned.  Historic capital expenditures are 100% deductible at the start of production.  No royalty or production bonus or their equivalents are required.The regime was introduced with a view to establishing a risk/reward balance, which reflects Ireland's circumstances, including the industry perception of relative prospectivity, and acknowledges the realities of competition for internationally mobile exploration/production investment.  I recently put in motion a review of the licensing regime under which offshore exploration companies operate in this country.My Department recently engaged the advice of external experts to independently validate the proposed changes.  When I have received and considered the report of the external experts I will bring forward proposals in relation to the licensing regime for exploration and production.I should point out to the Deputy that Nigeria is one of the biggest oil producers in the world, and a substantial gas producer, and is a proven petroleum province. Ireland, on the other hand, does not currently produce any oil and only produces approximately 15% of its gas requirements.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	725	I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 217 together.In 2004 there were 14,000 litres of biofuels produced in Ireland.  This figure rose to over 1.3 million litres of biofuels being produced in 2005.A number of initiatives are in place to support the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland.  The 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief and will result in 16 million litres of biofuels being placed on the Irish transport market by next year.Building on the success of this scheme I launched the Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme II, valued at over €200 million, in July 2006.  The new excise relief programme, which is subject to State-aid approval, will be rolled out from this year to 2010 and will enable us to reach a target of 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008.  When fully operational the relief is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year.  I am also providing funding towards the capital cost of developing biofuels processing facilities, which will critically underpin the excise relief package.Ireland, like many other EU Member States, is developing its biofuels sector from a low base.  This is borne out by the fact that Member States combined reported a target of 1.4% for 2005, which is below the Directive's indicative target.  The Commission has however, accepted Ireland's target of 2% by 2008.I am firmly committed to the development of an Irish biofuels market and to the increased development of bio-energy generally in Ireland.  To this end, I launched a Ministerial Bio Energy Task Force in July 2006.  The primary objective of the Task Force is to draw up a cohesive national bio-energy strategy by the end of the year, which will set targets for deployment of bio-energy, identify priority areas for development and the necessary support measures to encourage supply and demand.  This strategy will also take account of EU developments, and the views of key stakeholders under the Energy Green Paper consultation process.

This is comprised of gross provisions of €371.803 million for current expenditure and €155.885 million for capital expenditure less approved Appropriations-in-Aid of €236.248 million.  In addition, my Department has an allocation of €11.429 million in unspent capital from 2005, the surrender of which was deferred in accordance with Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004.At this stage, I do not anticipate any aggregate savings on my Department's current budget for 2006.  I expect that any shortfall on capital expenditure will be accommodated within the terms of Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004, which provides for Departments to carry over into the following year, unspent capital allocations of up to 10% of the voted capital provision.

However, it has been clear for some time that the private sector has failed to invest in broadband infrastructure at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband.  My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities.  These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity.  The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector.My Department offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the County and Group Broadband Scheme.  The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area.  To date, over 160 projects have been approved for funding under this Programme.  A joint industry/Government fund of €18 million has been established for the Broadband for Schools Programme to resource the provision of high speed broadband connectivity to all primary and post primary schools in the country by end Autumn 2006, at no cost to the schools themselves. 95% of schools have broadband installed to date; the aim is to complete the outstanding schools in the coming weeks.  However, I recognise that despite these successes there are some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  I am currently examining options to address the delivery of broadband services to these areas and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly.

Following a comprehensive consultation process with both BIM and the Department, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has as already secured a site for the Clonakilty Campus.  OPW has also awarded a contact for the construction of facilities following a competitive tendering process.  I understand that a planning application will be made by OPW in the coming weeks.  I also understand that completion time, depending on the progress of the planning process, would be late 2008.  I can confirm that BIM management met in the summer with the Government's Decentralisation Implementation Group to provide an update on progress. BIM management are working towards a relocation timetable of 2008.  To date, no BIM staff have relocated to Clonakilty.  The costs of the decentralisation facilities in Clonakilty is a matter for OPW and the Department of Finance.

The target of 13.2% approximates to 1450 megawatts (MW) of installed generating capacity to be operational to the electricity network by 2010.  Currently there are over 860MW of renewable capacity connected to the national grid.  This consists of over 590MW of wind powered plant, 236MW of hydro powered plant with the balance (circa 35MWs) made up of different biomass technologies.  Support mechanisms put in place by the Government have more than doubled the capacity of renewable energy powered electricity generating plants connected to the electricity network in the last two years.  Building on this progress I recently announced an ambitious programme to almost treble the contribution by renewable energy sources from 5.2% of gross electricity consumption in 2004, the last full year for which figures are available, to 15% by 2010.  The new target will require growth in the sector to more than double from the capacity currently connected to 1650 megawatts by 2010. The additional new capacity required to achieve this target will be delivered by projects under the previous AER V and AER VI competitions and the new Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff programme.  The forthcoming Energy Green Paper will propose an even more ambitious target for increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020.  The Green Paper is scheduled to be published on 1 October.

At this stage I do not envisage any significant savings on the current allocation, most of which is designated as either grant or grant-in-aid funding for the various bodies under the aegis of my Department.  The capital allocation in my Department's Vote for 2006 is provided under the terms of a 5-year Capital Investment Framework agreed annually between my Department and the Department of Finance under which savings of up to 10% of the total annual capital allocation in a current year may be carried forward to the following year, thus ensuring continuity in funding for capital schemes and projects.  While underspending on certain subheads is likely to occur this year, I do not anticipate that there will be a significant net overall capital saving on my Department's vote.  This is attributable to  a combination of the reallocation of these savings to other subheads and the application of the 10% carryover provision.  However, it is important to note, in the context of predicting year end results, that traditionally some 50% of the Department's capital spend occurs in the last 3 months of the year.

Of this, the Exchequer, through Fáilte Ireland, contributed €4.9m and the three co-sponsors contributed the balance (Bord Bia, Waterford Crystal, AIB).  In 2006 an additional €4.5 million has been specifically allocated to Fáilte Ireland in order to support an enhanced programme of marketing and promotional activities around the Ryder Cup, including a National Branding Programme and a number of golf marketing initiatives.  Additional funding is also being provided to Fáilte Ireland to support costs associated with a complementary programme of events with the European Tour including the official opening and closing ceremonies which made such a positive impact on international and domestic audiences.  The aim of these programmes was to capitalise on the opportunities offered by the unique event that is the Ryder Cup with a view to promoting an enduring positive image of Irish Tourism.  The success of the event, in terms of organisation and the presentation of a positive image of Ireland, has been widely acclaimed.  I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with information relating to the cost of infrastructure as this does not fall within the aegis of my Department.  Fáilte Ireland, in conjunction with the PGA/European Tour and other interests, have commissioned Deloitte and Touche to conduct an economic impact assessment on the Ryder Cup in Ireland and I look forward to the results of their work.  Based on the experience of past tournaments, it has been estimated that the economic benefits of the event to Ireland are of the order of €130m.

This figure includes €355.614 million from the National Training Fund and €29.780 million in capital allocations from 2005 which were carried forward in accordance with the provisions of the multi-annual Capital Investment Framework.  My Department and its agencies have a series of monitoring and audit systems in place to provide assurance that funding which is provided through the Estimates is spent appropriately.  At this stage, a small number of projected savings on 2006 allocations have been identified in some Subheads of my Department's Vote.  However, extra funding requirements have also been identified in other Subheads which will absorb most of these savings.  It is envisaged, at this stage, that any savings which remain in my Department's Vote at the end of the year will be minimal in the context of my Department's overall budget.  It will be my Department's intention, where appropriate under the terms of the Capital Investment Framework and/or the Administrative Budget Agreement, to seek to carry savings forward to address my Department's priorities in 2007.

The Survey provides a breakdown of data on a regional basis only and not on specific towns.  The most recent Survey data published in September shows that the national unemployment rate is 4.3%.  The equivalent rate for the West region, which includes Ballina, is 4.2%.Live register data is available for specific areas such as Ballina.  However, it is not designed to measure unemployment.  As well as showing the numbers claiming unemployment assistance and benefit it also includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers who would be entitled to unemployment benefit.  In August of 2005 there were 1,605 people on the live register in Ballina.  The most recent data available is for August of 2006, which shows that this number had fallen to 1,448.State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies, and while I may give general policy directives to the agencies under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.  I have been assured by the agencies under the remit of my Department that they are endeavouring to attract new investment, to encourage the start-up of new businesses, to grow existing businesses and to develop the labour market in County Mayo.IDA Ireland is actively promoting Ballina for new foreign investment and since January 2003, there have been five first time site visits to Ballina.  In addition IDA Ireland is actively working with the existing base of overseas companies in Ballina and Mayo to encourage them to grow and expand.  The Agency is also working closely with local groups, utility providers, the local authorities in the county and other agencies to enhance the attractiveness of the county, including Ballina, for new investment and jobs.  In that regard IDA Ireland has been deeply involved with local partners in the development of Regional Planning Guidelines.IDA Ireland has had extensive discussion with Mayo County Council in relation to the Business & Technology Park on the Sligo Road in Ballina and are awaiting the contract documentation and a copy of unburden title from the Council.I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by the agencies under the remit of my Department, together with the Governments commitment to regional development will continue to bear fruit in terms of the creation of sustainable development for the people of Ballina and of the West generally.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The Groceries Order was abolished primarily because it allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices charged to consumers, thereby seriously constraining price competition in the grocery trade.  During the time the Groceries Order was in force more than 2,000 small independent retailers went out of business resulting in the grocery trade in Ireland becoming more concentrated in the hands of fewer participants.The combined impact of these events was to create a floor under the retail price below which groceries could not be sold.  This resulted in Irish consumers paying more for their groceries than would otherwise have been the case.  However, there are many factors which impact on the price of groceries in our supermarkets.  The lack of competition caused by the Groceries Order was only one such factor.  Others would include production costs, labour costs, interest rates, overheads, international exchange rates and so on.  Because of this, and despite the implication in the question, I never made any predictions as to the likely extent of price reductions resulting from the removal of the Order.  I believe, however, that consumers are already seeing some early benefits with one multiple recently announcing its intention over coming months to implement reductions in the prices of thousands of products previously covered by the Groceries Order.  This announcement appears to have had a positive impact on competition in the market with other significant players adopting competitive pricing strategies.  I believe, however, that the real benefits will be felt over time as price competition increases at retail level thus reversing the 18 years of damage caused by the Order.I have asked the Competition Authority to closely monitor the grocery sector, not least to ensure that the benefits of removing the Order are not thwarted by the emergence of other anti-competitive practices.  That is why, for example, the Competition Act 2006 prohibits practices such as resale maintenance, which were institutionalised by the Order.  It would be very damaging to consumer interests if such practices were to emerge within the grocery trade in another guise.  My officials have had discussions with the Authority in this regard and will continue to meet with them as the process develops.  I have also asked the Authority to report periodically on the results of their monitoring and to make any recommendations they consider appropriate in the light of their findings.

Enterprise Ireland will be investing €175 million which will leverage an estimated €1 billion for investment into seed, start-up and development stage businesses.  This money is being made available via Enterprise Ireland to venture capital funds that will be able to invest throughout Ireland.  The objectives of the scheme are to continue to support the venture capital industry, to leverage private sector funding and to encourage investment in those sectors that have difficulty in sourcing funding.An advertisement was placed in the national press in June 2006 inviting expressions of interest from promoters and venture capital funds.  Following a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of the applications, Enterprise Ireland are in the process of engaging with successful applicants who will receive a commitment of funding.  Initial offers of funding have now been issued to successful Funds.The Board of Enterprise Ireland is making these commitments based on the relative level of alignment of the Funds' investment strategies with the objectives of the Scheme and the overall strategic objectives of Enterprise Ireland.  Preference was given to Funds that demonstrated the ability to meet the following criteria:1. The extent to which the Funds will focus in Ireland on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with international trading potential.2. The extent to which the funds will invest in seed, start-up and development stage investments.3. The extent to which the funds will invest in regions outside of Dublin.4. The likely impact of venture capital investment on SMEs gaining access to other forms of national and international funding.Regional development is a core strategic objective of Enterprise Ireland.  Venture capitalists will be looking for commercial opportunities for investment throughout the State, including companies based in the western counties such as client companies of Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission.

He had previously been refused carer's allowance on the grounds that he was engaged in employment for more than ten hours per week.  The limit on the number of hours of employment was raised to fifteen hours with effect from 1st June 2006, enabling the person concerned to qualify from that date.As he is assessed with means of €52.31 derived from income from farming and income from his spouse's employment, his weekly rate of carer's allowance is €135.  He also qualifies for child dependent allowance of €42 per week.  His payable order books will be available for collection at his local post office on 28 September 2006.A cheque for arrears of allowance due for the period 1 June 2006 to 27 September 2006 in the amount of €4,209 is in course of issue and includes the Respite Care Grant for 2006 of €1,200.  The person concerned has also qualified for a free travel pass.  His entitlement to the Household Benefits package will be assessed on receipt of the completed application form which was forwarded directly to him.

However, the indications at this stage of the year are that the Vote 38 allocation will be spent in full and that there will be a slight excess in the expenditure provision from the Fund, which will be more than off-set by increased income.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	747	I understand that the Deputy is concerned about the impact on entitlement to disability allowance where an existing single recipient marries or cohabits with a partner who is employed, particularly where the couple wish to take out a mortgage to purchase a property.  In the case of all social assistance schemes, including disability allowance, account is taken, for means testing purposes, of the claimant's own means and, in the case of a couple, their joint means.In assessing means, an initial amount of a spouse or partner's earnings, net of tax, PRSI, superannuation contributions and health insurance contributions, is disregarded.  Any mortgage repayments which the claimant and/or the spouse or partner may be paying are not included in the calculation of the disregard.In Budget 2006, I was pleased to be able to increase the level of the disregard, from €88.88 to €100 a week.  This comes into effect from next week for the purposes of disability allowance.  I also announced an increase in the spouse or partner's income threshold (gross) for entitlement to the full rate of qualified adult allowance increases from €88.88 to €100 a week.  The upper income threshold for entitlement to a reduced rate of qualified adult allowance was increased by €20 per week, to €240 per week with effect from last January and this will further increase to €250 concurrently with the other improvements detailed above.The purpose of both of these measures was to encourage the spouses or partners of social assistance recipients generally to take up employment.  It is not possible, at this stage, to estimate the cost of disregarding all spousal income in the case of disability allowance or other social assistance schemes.I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me.  Proposals involving additional expenditure must be considered in a budgetary context.

All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.There have been a number of requests and enquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK when they return to Ireland for a visit.  I have been advised that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.I have raised the issue with the European Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs.  In addition, officials from my Department have met with European Commission officials on two occasions in an effort to clarify the legal issues involved.  I am keeping this issue under review and contacts with the European Commission are ongoing.In relation to the centenarian's bounty, the Government has approved in principle the extension of the scheme for the payment of the centenarians' bounty to any Irish citizen who was born in the island of Ireland, regardless of where he or she may currently reside.  Up to now the bounty, which currently amounts to €2,500, was payable only to centenarians living in the State.  The bounty is a discretionary grant and not a service or scheme and accordingly it does not come within the scope of the EU Treaty.  In this way, it differs from the proposed extension of the free travel scheme.

He appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The Appeals Officer upheld the Deciding Officer's decision and the person concerned was notified accordingly on 6 June 2006.  If his circumstances have changed, it is open to the person concerned to re-apply for unemployment assistance.  He does not have a current claim.  However, he is currently in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance at the weekly rate of EUR 165.80.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

Occupational injuries benefit is payable to people with pneumoconiosis on the same basis as to people with other prescribed conditions.Disablement benefit, payable under the occupational injuries scheme, is a compensation payment for loss of faculty arising out of or in the course of insurable employment.  The legislation provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.  In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.Persons claiming occupational injuries benefit in cases of Pneumoconiosis are referred to Consultant Respiratory Physicians in the first instance for an examination and report.  This examination consists of a clinical assessment and pulmonary function testing (PFT).  Disablement benefit is awarded on the basis of the consultant's report, including the pulmonary function test result.  The degree of disablement is expressed as a percentage of loss of faculty and the compensation payable varies accordingly.Loss of faculty may be determined within a range of less than 1% to 100%, depending on the severity of the condition.  With regard to the 21 persons currently in receipt of disablement benefit as a result of contracting pneumoconiosis from their occupation the percentage of disablement assessed ranges from 8% to 90%.  A person must be assessed as having a minimum of 20% loss of faculty before they may be considered as being incapable of work due to their disablement.  These arrangements apply generally and there are no plans for special arrangements in the case of pneumoconiosis.

The Ennis to Athenry section is to be completed in 2008, the Athenry to Tuam section in 2011 and the Tuam to Claremorris section in 2014.Yesterday, I announced Government approval for funding for the development of the first phase of the Western Rail Corridor from Ennis to Athenry.  I have asked Irish Rail to proceed now with the detailed planning and design of the project, with a view to commencing track renewal in mid-2007 and completing the project in 2008.  I also announced that, subject to some further studies to be completed by Irish Rail, the Government has approved funding in principle for the development of phase 2 of the corridor between Athenry and Tuam, scheduled for completion by 2011.In relation to phase 3 of the project, the development of the section from Tuam to Claremorris, I expect to receive business case proposals from Irish Rail at the appropriate time and in accordance with the timetable announced under Transport 21.  In addition, on 18 September last, my Cabinet colleague Minister Ó Cuív announced that funding for the preservation of the Claremorris to Collooney section of the corridor would be provided under the CLÁR Programme.

The RPA began a public consultation on five potential routes for linking the two existing Luas lines in the city centre in November 2005.  This consultation is ongoing.  I understand that the RPA is engaged in dialogue with the City Council, Dublin Bus and the Dublin Transportation Office in relation to the implications of the potential routes for other road users.  Subject to satisfactory outcome of those discussions, the RPA expect to identify a preferred option in November 2006 and following this an application for a Railway Order will be made.Construction timescale will be dependent on the route chosen following the public consultation and the discussions with stakeholders.

Neither the Minister for Transport nor his Department have any function in relation to specific allocations to individual project groups.  Similarly, Pobal, together with the individual RTI project groups, are solely responsible for all the operational aspects of the initiative, including the specific services to be provided and the methods of provision.Following the success of the pilot phase of the RTI, my colleague the Minister for Transport announced his intention to conclude this phase at the end of 2006 and to put the Initiative on a permanent footing from 2007 onwards.  Proposals in that regard have recently been the focus of a public consultation process and the Department will now proceed to finalise its policy options with due consideration for the comments received.  In developing proposals for the roll-out of the RTI post-2006, the Department will pay particular attention to the transport needs of rural communities that do not currently have access to public transport.The Department has been steadily increasing the funding for the RTI in recent years.  Euro 4.5 million was provided for the RTI in 2005, which was a 50% increase on the 2004 allocation while the 2006 allocation is Euro 5.1 million.  By the end of 2006 total funding for the initiative will have exceeded Euro 18.5 million.  This compares with the original proposed allocation of Euro 4.4 million in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.Based on the 2005 allocation of Euro 4.5 million, and in parallel with the implementation of the Government's ten-year Transport Investment Framework, Transport 21, the Department will double the cash funding available to the RTI by 2007.  Thereafter, the funding available for rural transport services will steadily increase; ultimately to a cash level about four times the 2005 allocation.

The proposal to which the Deputy refers was included in the submissions received.  Those submissions will be assessed and prioritised by my Department with the assistance of expert advice and I expect to be in a position to announce the allocation of funding to the individual airports in November.

The Capital Expenditure Grant Scheme involves a budget of €65 million in respect of assistance for capital projects at these airports in the period up to the end of 2010.  The Core Airport Management Operational Expenditure Subvention Scheme provides for financial assistance, calculated on an annual basis, towards operational expenditure incurred in the provision of core airport services which cannot be fully recovered from the normal revenue streams otherwise available to the regional airports.While informal discussions with the relevant Commission officials suggested that the two schemes were fully in compliance with the guidelines, in the interest of legal certainty they were formally notified to the Commission for definitive approval.  I am now advised that the operational expenditure subvention scheme is considered by the Commission to be exempt from the need for such notification and consequently, does not require formal approval and may proceed as planned.  In the case of the capital grant scheme, the Commission decided on 26th September to approve the scheme as submitted.Meanwhile, all of the regional airports have submitted applications for funding under the new schemes.  These will be assessed by my Department with the assistance of expert advice and I expect to be in a position to announce the allocations to the individual airports in November.

Priority in such an investigation must be given to the determination of the causes of road accidents and in particular whether a breach of the Road Traffic laws contributed to the occurrence.The Garda Síochána is the body empowered to make such a determination and to launch criminal proceedings against any person who the Garda consider should be accused of the commission of an offence.  Garda reports on these investigations are forwarded to the National Roads Authority and subsequently to each local authority for the purpose of the establishment of accident trends and causes generally and to facilitate the carrying out of remedial works relating to road infrastructure where such action is deemed to be necessary.The Road Safety Authority now has responsibility for road safety research and statistical collection.  This will result in a more integrated approach to road safety policy generally, with one agency responsible for road safety research, statistical data, advertising, education and recommendations regarding road safety policy.

This includes a capital carryover from 2005 of €18.3 million and an Administrative budget carryover of €8.7m.  On the basis of expenditure to date, it would appear that almost all of the funds allocated to my department this year will be spent, but that there may be some savings on demand led schemes.My Department will continue to carefully monitor expenditure as the year progresses, but it is too early at this stage to be certain about the final outturn for the year.  Most of my Department's expenditure relates to demand-led schemes, animal disease control measures and technical and financial costs relating to intervention.  As this expenditure depends on external factors such as demand, market conditions and animal disease levels, it is difficult to predict budgetary needs and outturns with precision.  In addition, under multi annual administrative budget and capital envelope arrangements agreed with the Department of Finance, savings can be carried over into 2007 to meet needs arising next year.

The applicant established 33.14 standard entitlements and 1.72 set-aside entitlements having submitted a successful application as a New Entrant.  In addition he received 17.49 standard entitlements and 1.59 set-aside entitlements by way of a Private Contract Clause (lease).In accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU Regulations one eligible hectare must be declared in respect of each entitlement held in order to benefit from full payment under the Single Payment Scheme.  The person named submitted sufficient eligible hectares to draw down his full set-aside payment but not enough hectares to draw down full payment on his standard entitlements.  The payment made to the person named was correctly calculated taking into account the shortfall of 7.88 hectares in his declared hectares in respect of 2005.

Roscommon.  The total amount paid by my Department in the past ten years to the Company was €390,000.Discussions are on-going between Enterprise Ireland and the Company on the possible level of liability arising from the decision to discontinue the slaughtering and boning activities at Rooskey, while retaining and developing the cannery operations from the Rooskey site, and having regard to the company's other significant capital investment in the Irish pork sector.As the issues are complex, the discussions and examination have taken some time.  Progress has been made and it is anticipated that a conclusion will be reached in the near future.  Where any amounts are identified as due, the process of recovery will follow.In the meantime Enterprise Ireland is endeavouring to stimulate further investment at the Rooskey plant.  Discussions are at an earlystage and have yet to be comprehensively developed.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	778	I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 and 275 together.The Animal Remedies Regulations 2005, which came into effect in November 2005, transposed into Irish legislation EU Directive 2004/28.  This Directive includes a general requirement that all medicines for food-producing animals may only be supplied on the basis of a veterinary prescription from 1 January 2007, unless exempted from this requirement under criteria to be adopted at EU level.The Commission has recently circulated its formal proposals for exemption criteria and these are due to be considered by Member States at a meeting of the relevant standing committee on 11 October.  While the proposals are still being considered in detail within my Department and in the Irish Medicines Board, it is clear that, on the basis of an initial examination, the latest proposals represent a considerable improvement over the Commission's initial draft published in February last in that they provide a much greater degree of flexibility to regulatory bodies, such as IMB, in determining the routes of supply for individual products based on scientific evaluation of the risk/benefit analysis.The objective of my Department continues to be to secure exemption criteria which will facilitate the retention of off-prescription status in Ireland for the existing range of products and hopefully this issue will be finally resolved on 11 October.  As I have indicated in the past, if the exemption criteria adopted by the EU necessitate the re-classification of veterinary medicines as prescription only products, I will make provision for suitable persons to prescribe the new prescription-only products.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	783	For the purpose of replying to the Deputy I understand the question relates to mature students who hold an undergraduate degree and are progressing to postgraduate level courses, for the first time, at Masters Degree level.Under the terms of my Department's Third Level Maintenance Grant Schemes, which are administered on behalf of the Department by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees, the position is that generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, age, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  An approved course for the purpose of the Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and full time postgraduate course of not less that one years duration pursued in an approved institution.Under the terms of the Department's maintenance grants schemes, and in accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians.  An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' or guardians' income or address.Under the terms of the Third Level Student Support Schemes, a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether a grant was paid previously.  The schemes also provide that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.  Notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course which represents progression from the level at which the previous postgraduate qualification(s) was attained, may be deemed eligible for grant aid.However, tax relief is available in respect of postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU Member States, as well as in private colleges in the State.  This relief applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full time and part time postgraduate students.  Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local Tax Offices.The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.Under my Department's Free Fees Initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses in the State.  The Free Fees Initiative does not extend to postgraduate study.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	787	As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at both primary and post-primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools.  Some 170 such posts were sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared with 105 in 2004/05.The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas including the impact of inward migration and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.In planning for school provision to meet these demands the Department has adopted an area based approach which involves a public consultation process involving all interested parties.  This leads to the production of a blueprint for schools' development in an area for a timeframe of approximately ten years.  The exercise recently completed on the N4-M4 corridor is an example of this and the rapidly developing areas of north Dublin, south Louth and east Meath are being examined this year.  This structured process will ensure a more proactive approach to school planning than had been the case in the past.Apart from the area development planning process the Department is also proactively engaged with local authorities on a continual basis in relation to specific areas.  This is being done through improved contacts and communication protocols to ensure that the Department is better alerted about new and expanding residential areas and afforded an opportunity to ensure appropriate zoning provision for educational purposes.For example in the case of the Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) at Adamstown the Department is working closely with South Dublin County Council and the developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing.  Under the SDZ arrangements there is a requirement that schools are in position ahead of or in line with demand, and I think it is one that should be adopted by other planning authorities in relation to major new housing schemes.The Department is working particularly closely with Fingal County Council to develop a joint approach to the timely provision of schools in an area of the country subject to extremely rapid development.  This work is providing innovative approaches to partnership which I believe can be used to advantage across the country in future.The Department prioritises school buildings for rapidly developing areas.  This is achieved by assigning them a band one priority rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  Whenever possible, the Department implements a standardised design model or a design and build process to fast track delivery of the buildings themselves.  Not alone does this result in speedier delivery of projects but it also achieves savings in design fees and land use arising from the use of the two storey design.  Among schools completed using one of these processes is Griffeen Valley in Lucan which was completed in a 13 month timeframe.The level of work being done under the schools building programme is at an all-time high.  While increased investment is a central reason for this — €500m this year alone — radical changes in how projects are planned and managed have also made a major difference in ensuring that provision is delivered in line with or ahead of demand.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	800	I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 and 304 together.I assume the Deputies are referring to Ireland's expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP.  Deputies will be aware, given the distinctive structure of the Irish economy and specifically, the comparatively high proportion of our GDP that is expatriated as profits of foreign direct investment enterprises, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is not a good indicator of the relative resources available in the case of Ireland.  For example, the difference in magnitude between Ireland's GDP and Gross National Income (GNI) was 18% in 2003.  This means that standardised expenditure data for Ireland would be higher if GNI (or GNP) were used instead of GDP.  For most OECD countries, however, the difference between GDP and GNI is negligible and the vast majority of other countries are quite happy to continue using GDP to standardise international data on expenditure.  Department of Education and Science expenditure on education in Ireland in 2003, the reference year used in the latest ‘Education at a Glance' report, represented 4.9% of Gross National Income.  This increased to 5.2% in 2005.The Deputy should also note that spending by my Department on second level education increased by 17% between 2003 and 2005.  In 2005, €2.7 billion was spent on second level education — up from €2.3 billion in 2003 and €1.25 billion in 1997.These increases have allowed for major progress to be made both in the staffing and in the day-to-day funding of our schools.With regard to staffing, it should be noted that there is now one teacher for every 13 students at second level.Day-to-day funding for our schools has also increased significantly in recent years.  Since the financial year referred to in the OECD report — 2003 — second level schools have benefited from substantial increases in funding.  The standard capitation grant of €266 per pupil in 2003 has stood at €298 per pupil from 1 January last.  In addition, the support services grant for secondary schools was increased from €127 per pupil in 2003 to €159 per pupil from January last.  This per capita grant is in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools.This Government has dramatically increased investment in education in recent years.  However, it is simplistic to just say that increasing spending will result in better outcomes as evidenced by the relatively poor educational outcomes of some high-spending countries.  What we all wish to see is the resources targeted towards education being used to best advantage at all levels.

Adult Literacy has been the top priority in adult education in my Department for some years now.Since 1997, funding from my Department for adult literacy has increased incrementally, from €1 million to almost €23 million in 2006. As a consequence, the number of clients catered for annually has increased from 5,000 in 1997 to over 35,000 in 2005.The growth in the number of adult literacy students has exceeded the target of 18,000 annually set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.This year my Department funded a pilot project on intensive tuition in adult basic education which would help to address the serious problem of adult literacy.  The evaluation report of this project is currently being examined. In addition, a family literacy initiative under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) — An Action Plan in Educational Inclusion is being developed.Last Sunday, a new TV series "The Really Useful Guide to Words and Numbers" commenced on national television.  This programme will target people with literacy and numeracy needs."Towards 2016 — Ten Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006 — 2015" includes a further increase in literacy student numbers of 7,000 (6% per annum) over a three-year period to 2009 and also 2,000 BTEI places which will continue to build on existing part-time provision in adult literacy and other Further Education programmes.  These additional resources are to be welcomed.I am currently examining the Report on Adult Literacy in Ireland published by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science.  The 28 recommendations included in the report will be considered in the context of the overall policy of making further improvements in literacy provision nationwide as resources permit.While significant progress has been, and continues to be, made in addressing the problem of adult literacy, I strongly believe in the value of this sector and am committed to a continuation of the process of substantially reducing the literacy deficit in Irish society by continuing to prioritise it for resources and supports in the years ahead.

This work is providing innovative approaches to partnership in terms of providing educational infrastructure and shared community facilities in tandem.  While the overall model is at the early stages of implementation, already, at Diswellstown, there is a very fine example of what an integrated approach to the delivery of education and community facilities can achieve.  The Department looks forward to a broader range of enhanced facilities for school and community use as the model develops at various locations in the Fingal area where it is estimated up to 20 schools will be required in the coming years.  I believe this model can be used to advantage across the country in future particularly in the area of shared community facilities.Apart from the planning process, the Department prioritises school buildings for rapidly developing areas.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.  It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	805	Officials in the School Planning Section of my Department will be liaising with the school to which the Deputy refers with a view to providing it with accommodation in line with demand from eligible pupils under its enrolment policy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	806	The building project for the School referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning.  This School was among 40 Schools that I announced in April of this year to go to tender and construction on a rolling basis over the next 12 to 15 months.  My Department's Officials wrote to the School Authorities on the 22nd September 2006 looking for a revised stage 1/2/3 (detailed plans/costs) submission.  When a response is forwarded to my Department, my Officials will then be in a position to further progress this project.

I understand that further documentation must be submitted before a decision can be made by Kilkenny VEC in this case.  Queries in regard to the Back to Education Scheme should be referred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs as this scheme is relevant to that Department.

When this has been received and examined, it will be in contact with the schools as to how the proposed project can proceed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	809	As the Deputy will probably be aware, the application for large scale capital funding from the school to which he refers was originally considered under the Department's devolved grant scheme. It transpired, however that the scope of the works required to meet the schools long term accommodation needs exceeded the limits of this scheme.  In the circumstances, its application has been reverted to the traditional method of delivery.  Accordingly, the application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale projects and it has been assigned a Band 2 rating.  Progress on the proposed works is now being considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme from 2007 onwards.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	810	I am aware of the school's need for additional accommodation and can advise the Deputy that my Department is grant-aiding the rental costs of two portakabins at the school in order  to alleviate short term accommodation difficulties.My Department is also in receipt of an application for capital funding towards the provision of an extension to the school.  An assessment of projected enrolments, demographic trends and housing developments in the area is under way in order to determine the long term projected staffing on which the school's long term accommodation needs will be based. When this assessment is completed a decision will then be taken on how best to provide the required accommodation.The project will be then considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme 2006-10.

No savings are expected to arise on the Army Pensions Vote.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	812	In 2004 I sought local authorities to set about the preparation of social and affordable housing action plans to provide a framework for the integrated and cohesive planning and delivery over the coming years of specific social and affordable housing measures in each local authority area.  Provision was made with the Department for a mid-term review of the plans to take place in 2006, to take account of both performance and any new policy initiatives.To facilitate the review my Department has held bilateral meetings with all local authorities to discuss progress, changing needs and targets for the remainder of the Plan.  Following the meetings local authorities have submitted review statements, which include commentary on overall performance; noting any significant deviations from the original planned targets and the reasons for such deviations; indicating if the overall targets are still valid in light of the recent Housing Needs Assessment or for other reasons; explaining any proposed changes to the targets for the remaining period of the plan and reviewing the plan in light of developments in areas such as Rental Assistance Scheme (RAS).At this stage review statements have been received from all local authorities and a preliminary analysis has been carried out.  Output figures for a number of schemes need to be clarified.  While overall output is below target on some of the schemes, there is considerable optimism that over the full period of the plan, targets will be met.  For example, Part V is now starting to gather momentum and has the potential to meet all affordable housing needs in some local authorities, while together with RAS it may overtake the main housing construction programme in other authorities, in meeting the long-term needs of a large number of applicants on the waiting list.An Action Plan Working Group is currently being formed to carry out full analysis of this stage of the Action Plans.  As well as examining performance to date the Group will make recommendations on a number of areas such as actions to improve delivery and monitoring of Action Plans in the future.  In light of the fact that the review is ongoing and the detailed information sought in the Question is not fully collated, a breakdown at county level cannot yet be provided.  However, considerable information on the supply of social and affordable housing, broken down by local authority is currently available on my Department's website www.environ.ie.  Once the review has been finalised the report will be available from the Department.The social and affordable action plans have provided local authorities and the Department with a focused framework for identifying needs, setting targets, measuring progress and taking account of changes in the housing policy arena.  The mid-term review exercise has facilitated a reflection of all aspects of the first two years of the plan in terms of achievements and the remainder of the plan in light of developments.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	813	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have issued the following reports regarding the water quality in Ireland's waterways in the past year: Phosphorous Regulations National Implementation Report 2005, Water Quality in Ireland 2005 Key Indicators of the Aquatic Environment, and Environment in Focus 2006 Environmental Indicators for Ireland.  The Water Quality in Ireland 2005 Key Indicators of the Aquatic Environment report (August 2006) analyses what EPA consider to be the top ten core indicators of water quality in Ireland, namely river quality, nitrates in rivers, lake quality, fish kills, estuarine and coastal water quality, quality of shellfish waters, pollution at sea incidents, bathing water quality, faecal coliforms in ground water and nitrates in ground water.  None of the EPA reports makes particular reference to the dumping of excretion from cruise boats in Ireland's waterways.The EPA report that the main threats to the quality of Ireland's surface waters are municipal sewerage and diffuse agricultural pollution sources.  These issues are being addressed by major investment in the Water Services Investment Programme and measures such as the Nitrates Regulations.  However, my Department has over the years sought to facilitate the provision of sewerage infrastructure to serve cruise boats under the Water Services Investment programme.

At this stage in the year I anticipate that the provision should be sufficient to meet demands and that savings, if any, will be relatively small.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	815	North Tipperary County Council has submitted a proposal to my Department for the provision of a new fire station at Cloughjordan, Co. Tipperary.  Funding in this regard was not included in the 2006 Fire Services Capital Programme.  However, the provision of such funding will be considered in future years having regard to overall demands on the fire service capital programme, the priorities of North Tipperary County Council, the level of activity, the proximity of other fire stations and the standard of the existing facilities.

Further consideration will be given to the proposal on receipt of the additional information recently requested from the Council.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	817	In relation to unauthorised waste activities, it is a matter for the relevant individual local authorities and/or the Office of Environmental Enforcement to investigate any instances or reports of illegal disposal of waste and take any appropriate action in relation to such cases.  My Department has no direct function in the matter.  The arrangements made by local authorities or by the Office of Environmental Enforcement in relation to public access to information is primarily a matter for these bodies, subject to compliance with relevant statutory provisions.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	818	The Achill Sound Sewerage Scheme has been approved under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme since June 2005.  In common with all projects funded under the Programme, my Department funds the capital costs associated with the provision of services to meet the requirements of the existing domestic population.  The additional marginal capital cost of servicing non-domestic consumers, and providing for future development, is recovered by the local authority from all non-domestic consumers in its functional area through a combination of water charges on commercial consumers and planning levies on future development.  It is important to note that this should be done on a countywide basis and not confined to local communities.  In fact it is only where a significant large scale consumer wishes to reserve a specific proportion of the overall capacity of a scheme that a direct contribution to the capital costs up-front is required for that consumer.  I understand that it is unlikely that there are any such consumers in this case.Proposals for a revised scheme for Achill Sound costing €5.377m were submitted to my Department by Mayo County Council in July last.  The Council was informed on 11 August that the Department would provide funding of €3.619m in respect of the revised proposals and I would hope that the Council will now advance this long delayed scheme.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	821	As the Deputy is aware, communications masts are generally required to obtain planning permission.  The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 set out certain exemptions in this area.  These include, subject to certain conditions, the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure, the erection of an antenna support structure in place of an existing antenna support structure and the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as telegraph poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings.  These Regulations were the subject of extensive debate in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government, and were subsequently approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources Report on Non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts (June 2005) recommended, inter alia, that planning guidelines and planning exemptions be examined with a view to ensuring that no ‘electromagnetic emissions' or ‘radio frequency emissions' emitting equipment be permitted to be sited near health centres, schools or other sensitive sites such as playgrounds or pitches, etc.On receipt the report of the Joint Committee, the Government, in September 2005, approved the establishment of an inter-departmental advisory committee and an expert group, working to the committee, on the health effects of electromagnetic fields.  This Department is represented on the committee.  The work of the committee and expert group is in train and I understand that their report is expected to be made to the Government by the end 2006, following which the Government will address appropriate action.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-09-28 00:00:00	Prelude	822	Shared ownership loans are provided solely by local authorities and, given that, the commercial lending agencies do not finance arrangements in which the local authority retains a share in the dwelling.  Finance for these loans is made available by the Housing Finance Agency at a competitive rate, identical to their variable interest rate for other types of house purchase.  There is no direct comparability between shared ownership loans and loans provided by private institutions in other circumstances.  The claw-back condition operating under the various affordable schemes is a standard arrangement across all local authorities, and is designed to prevent short term profit taking on the basis of the publicly provided subsidies.
