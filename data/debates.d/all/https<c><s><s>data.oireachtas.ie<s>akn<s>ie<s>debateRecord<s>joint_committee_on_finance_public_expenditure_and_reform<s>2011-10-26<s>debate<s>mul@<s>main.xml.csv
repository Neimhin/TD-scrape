#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	0	We are meeting to consider the debt dynamic facing the State.  To discuss this issue, I welcome Professor John FitzGerald from the Economic and Social Research Institute whose opening remarks will be followed by a question and answer session.  He supplied in advance a summary of his presentation which was very useful.I remind members, witnesses and persons in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile phones which should be kept in the off position to ensure they do not interfere with the sound recording.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they do not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary ruling of the Chair that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.I now invite Professor FitzGerald to commence his presentation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank the Chairman for inviting me to attend.  The paper about which I will talk was published at the beginning of September and well reported on in the newspapers.  I have provided members with a summary.  We prepared it because we considered many things had changed during the previous six months - they had changed for the better up to the beginning of August - and we wanted to revise the numbers to take account of this fact.  To simplify matters and avoid getting involved in arguments about the growth rate, about which I am happy to talk separately, we took the Department of Finance's April numbers.  We said we would look at how the debt had changed as a result of the fact that the bank recapitalisation figures were half of what had been expected and that interest rates were dramatically lower than had been anticipated.I have provided a few slides.  One of the factors that is striking when one looks at Ireland compared to other countries is the extent of the liquid assets traditionally held.  We hold a load of cash.  If one wants to compare Ireland to other countries, one must use net liquid assets.  When one looks at the net debt, the normal definition used in the 1980s into the 1990s, the position looks only slightly better.  It knocks roughly ten percentage points - I give the precise numbers in the summary - off the debt.The second factor is that 40% of the debt outstanding at the end of this year, 40 percentage points of GDP, will be due directly to the banking sector.  When one looks at the gross debt-GDP ratio peaking at 110% to 115%, one must consider that we would be at a figure of 70% to 75%, a huge increase on what it was - 25% in 2007.  Therefore, the size of Ireland's debt is particularly the consequence of the banking sector collapse.We have had to take dramatic fiscal action to bring the budgetary figures under control, as I do not need to emphasise.  The way we get out of this mess is that the tradeable sector - that is the sector that exports - has to grow and absorb much of the unused resources that were in building construction.  This is a long and painful process but it is well under way.The best indicator of countries that were driving dangerously before the crisis was their balance of payments deficits.  That is something to which we drew attention at the time.  In the case of this country and Spain, we were running budget surpluses but we were running a substantial and increasing balance of payments deficit.  That was the danger signal to which we should have paid attention.The sign that things are turning around is that we are now running a balance of payments surplus.  For every one percentage point that the Government takes out of the economy in discretionary fiscal action, one increases the balance of payments surplus by one percentage point.  We forecast 2% to 2.5% for next year.  The Central Bank predicts 3%.  At this rate we could end with a five percentage points balance of payments surplus.  That is "Ireland net" will be repaying debt at five percentage points of GDP.  At the moment we are looking at one to two percentage points of GDP this year.  The Government, on behalf of the people, is borrowing a great deal of money.  However, the people are repaying even more abroad.  Eventually what will happen will be that many households and companies will start to invest and we will see an eventual recovery.In terms of the debt numbers, what we did was we took the primary surplus, that is the Government's estimate of the deficit, less national debt interest payments, and we then revised the national debt interest payment figures.  The result is that by 2015, in the absence of any other change in the numbers, the borrowing requirement instead of being 2.8% which was envisaged in the numbers at the end of last year and in April of this year will be 1.7% of GDP.  The change in the interest rates makes a very big difference.  It gives us a substantial margin in terms of meeting our requirements.I show a graph outlining the debt to GDP ratio.  There is uncertainty around the numbers but the gross debt will peak at 113% of GDP in 2012, somewhere in the region of 110% to 115% under a wide range of possible outcomes.  The net debt will peak at 103% in 2013 and fall below 100% in 2015.  That takes no account of the sale of the single biggest financial asset the State has, namely, the banks.  We look at banks as a liability but as of end-July the accounting suggests that the regulatory capital - that is the excess of assets over liabilities in the pillar banks - was more than 20 percentage points of GDP.  The biggest change that we can make to the debt is to get back a great deal of taxpayers' money by eventually when the economy recovers selling those banks for a substantial sum.  It is unlikely that we will get back all of it but we could get back a significant proportion.The task ahead is to get back to funding ourselves.  Everything I say is conditional on the EU today and in the coming weeks sorting out its problems in that all bets are off - there is no future for Europe - unless it sorts out its problems, but conditional on that one would hope to get back to the markets next year or in 2013.  One aspect of that would be that one would want to probably start borrowing some money short even though the Government does not need it, because once the Sovereign borrows short then one would hope the banks would be able to borrow short as well.  It depends on Europe being seen to have a future.In terms of the risk to that outcome, the biggest risks now are outside of this country.  It appears that we understand the full magnitude of the hole in the banking system.  The strategy must be to get the economy growing again and to return to the markets.  In terms of what to do with the banks, one of the pressures is the pressure to deleverage.  Much of the money that was put into the banks was to allow us to sell assets at a loss, which is a pity if we could eventually get more money for the banks when we sell them, but the objective must be to restore the economy to growth and then to sell off the banks and get back some significant amount of taxpayers' money.  The most important issue is the return to growth.  We just took the Department of Finance numbers on that, but there is a range of possible outcomes in previous reports which we have looked at on which I can comment if members wish.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank Professor FitzGerald very much for that summary.  I call Deputy Michael McGrath.  I will take three colleagues at a time if that is agreed?  Agreed.  It is an information session and we wish to pursue what Professor FitzGerald has outlined in his paper.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I thank Professor FitzGerald for his attendance, his contribution and for submitting the presentation in advance.Based on the model outlined by him using Department of Finance numbers and projections, does he believe our debt is sustainable?  Ultimately it does come back to the level of economic growth.  Professor FitzGerald indicated that he used the Department of Finance's projections in that regard, which presumably go back to the April Stability and Growth Pact submission.  Those figures will certainly be downgraded when the Department publishes its pre-budget outlook early next month.  Perhaps there will be a reduction of up to 1% in 2012.  What impact will that have on the numbers outlined?Professor FitzGerald forecast that the deficit for 2011 could come in under 10% - that it could be 9.6%.  It would be symbolically significant to break the 10% mark.  Is he confident that will be achieved?  The summary presentation refers to the fact that the sale of any stake in the pillar banks could result in a substantial once-off reduction in the long-term debt burden.  Is it Professor FitzGerald's view that the proceeds generally of the sale of State assets should be used for the reduction of the debt burden as opposed to investing in the economy in employment-related initiatives?I seek a reaction to the submission by ICTU.  The Professor is aware of its general view that the adjustment in the public finances should be extended over a longer period.  The ICTU suggests a period of up to 2017 and points out that the €21 billion of austerity which will have been imposed by the end of the current year has come at a very high human and social cost.  What does Professor FitzGerald believe would be the consequence for this country of prolonging the adjustment to 2017?The key question is what Professor FitzGerald's views are on debt sustainability for the country.  Is it entirely contingent on economic growth?  What will happen if the economy remains largely flat, which we hope it does not, but if it does, or if there are low growth levels of between 1% and 2% for the next four or five years?  Are we then into unsustainable territory at that stage?
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	4	A number of presentations have been made to the committee in recent months and at other fora which committee members have attended which cause us great concern about how austerity can affect our ability to get out of where we are currently.  Some say we can afford more austerity because Government spending does not impact as much as we would like to think.  In spite of the massive cuts that have already been made, the economy seems to be robust enough and is growing to a small extent.Professor FitzGerald referred to increasing the austerity cuts in presentations he has made.  The word he used was to "front-load" the cuts.  Which option does he believe we should choose?  In a presentation to committee members by the Irish Taxation Institute it suggested that we are almost at the peak of increasing income taxes without having a negative effect on the economy.  It said we are probably reaching the tipping point in terms of indirect taxation such as VAT as well before it would start to have a direct effect on the economy.Professor FitzGerald referred to the balance of payments deficit in terms of us repaying our debts.  That is because we are killing off a certain amount of consumer spending in the economy.  Poor consumer spending is being mooted as one of the reasons we are not emerging from the crisis.  That relates to the point made by the Professor.In terms of front-loading austerity cuts, from the Government's point of view there is not much scope left on non-pay issues, leaving aside social welfare payments and pensions.  If we reduce expenditure on capital projects that will have a negative effect but I do not see where there is scope outside of Government saving.  Is Professor FitzGerald talking about looking at wages, pensions and social welfare payments in the context of front-loading austerity cuts?
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	5	On the debt projections through to 2015 the ESRI has reported on, those debt projections are lower than those of the troika and while we can assume that the rationale for a lower debt ratio is because of the reduction in interest payments and the requirement in terms of recapitalisation, which would have been lower than what the troika used in its assumptions, it is clear the ESRI has growth levels far above what EUROSTAT and the IMF have forecast.  I understand the ESRI is forecasting a 1.8% increase in real GDP while EUROSTAT is forecasting an increase of 0.6% while the IMF is forecasting a 0.5% increase.  Given what we know about the European economy, that there is serious concern about a recession, that inflation is on an upward trend, and what we know is happening in the American and the world economy, does Professor FitzGerald believe the ESRI's optimistic growth projections are credible?  Does he believe we need to revise downwards those projections and that he will be back before this committee or before the public in a few months revising downwards the ESRI's projections for 2012 and 2013?On Professor FitzGerald's comments that 40% of our debt will be made up of banking sector debt, there has been an ongoing discussion or argument between me and the Minister for Finance on the promissory note.  I suggested to him in this committee that the Governor of the Central Bank, the Regulator and Anglo Irish Bank needed to restructure the promissory note.  I am aware that others from the economic body, including Professor Karl Whelan, have made those arguments also.  I am glad to hear he has an expert panel examining this issue but there is disagreement on the actual cost to the State of the promissory note.  I would like to hear Professor FitzGerald's view.  The Minister is of the view that the promissory note will cost €47 billion, which will be the interest payments and the capital we paid to Anglo Irish Bank, which is not over a period of ten years as many people assume but over a period of 20 years.  There is also a cost to the State of borrowing this money over the next 20 years and if we add in the cost of borrowing at what is hopefully a realistic percentage rate, so that we can go back to the markets of approximately 4.8%, which is what we were borrowing in 2008 and 2009, that cost of the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note is increased to in excess of €75 billion.  That has been backed up by independent economists who have reported on this area.  What is Professor FitzGerald's view on the overall cost of the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note?  While there is a good deal of discussion about unguaranteed bondholders, and rightly so, to which the Government committed to apply burden-sharing, as of yet we have not had an announcement from the Minister for Finance on his decision as a result of his discussions with the European Central Bank on this matter and the fact that one of them will be paid €730 million next week?  If we want to make sufficient significant savings the first item on our agenda should be to announce that the State no longer has the money to pay back the promissory note and to start from that point.  I am very interested in what Professor FitzGerald believes is the total cost to the State, including the cost of borrowing in terms of the promissory note.Professor FitzGerald's document indicates that austerity is working but I suggest it is not.  During the period of the previous Administration of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, and of this Government, since 2009 we have seen adjustments, tax increases and cuts to the value of €20 billion, which has resulted in a 1.8% reduction in the deficit.  Can Professor FitzGerald explain the reason that type of austerity has only resulted in those type of savings?Another matter with which I disagree relates to point four of Professor FitzGerald's key assumptions in the document the ESRI has released.  It refers to using the liquid assets of the State to write down debt, including the liquid assets in the National Pension Reserve Fund, a fund that has already been raided by the previous Government and this Government to pay off bankers and banking debt.  It is important that we use that money for stimulus measures to get the economy back to growth, increase domestic demand and get people back to work.  I challenge Professor FitzGerald and the ESRI to examine the concept of a stimulus and what would be the effect of using the €5.4 billion that remains in the National Pension Reserve Fund to stimulate the economy instead of writing down our national debt.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	6	There are three sets of questions for Professor FitzGerald.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	7	My fear is that I may forget some of the sub-clauses of which no doubt the Chairman will remind me.Deputy Michael McGrath asked about sustainability.  We will not get the forecasts of growth right.  There is a wide range of uncertainty around that.  Our view is that we are looking at significant growth in the economy in the medium term but what happens if it were only 1%?  In section 4 of our article we tested what would happen with different growth rates and it is sustainable no matter what, providing we do the fiscal adjustment planned.  It begins to come down.  Obviously, the higher the growth rate the more rapidly it will come down and the better.The Deputy asked about the confidence in our forecast of a borrowing requirement for this year of 9.6%.  That is not our forecast for this year.  I took the Department of Finance's forecast, estimated the savings as a result of the good news in the first six months of the year and decided that if nothing else changed it would bring the deficit below 10%.  My current assessment and that of my colleagues is that the outturn could be ahead of schedule this year, but that is not forecast in this document.Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty raised the issue that the proceeds of sales of assets are the proceeds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The research done by my colleagues suggest that the best value in terms of creating jobs in Ireland is to avoid having to cut social welfare and expenditure more than we need to do in the period up to 2015.In terms of using State money to invest in the economy, and my colleague, Dr. Edgar Morgenroth, has written a paper on this, if, for example, we are only digging holes and filling them in again to create jobs, it is a very expensive way to create jobs because the value for money from doing that is poor.  A range of research by previous colleagues going back over a decade recommends that investment should not be undertaken unless it will produce a good rate of return for the State.  The rate of return for the State must be massively higher than it was in 2005 because of the changed circumstances.  There is a danger if we do not get this right that we could face even more austerity, and various people are promoting the idea that we should do more rather than the €15 billion over the four years but I do not want to be in that position.  Using up something now and finding ourselves having to continue the austerity programme over a much longer period is a bad idea.  That would be my advice on that area.On the matter of the ICTU proposing a longer period of adjustment and Deputy Twomey's question on the level of austerity we should impose, the answer on that is a fine call.  It is pretty miserable being in Ireland today for everybody and more miserable for many people who are in negative equity, unemployed or whatever.  If we delay this, however, will we remain miserable for a much longer period or should we get it over with more rapidly?  My assessment in respect of the €3.6 billion is that if things come in on schedule, and Deputy Doherty raised a relevant issue about the forecast for next year, and assuming the forecasts for the next year are as they are currently, I would stick to the €3.6 billion because we would be coming in ahead of schedule this year and next year and we would build up leeway for future years for things to go wrong.On the issue Deputy Pearse Doherty raised, I do not know yet what will happen next year and I would delay making that decision.  I set this out in a paper for the Budget Perspectives conference which is available on our website.  I referred to a figure of between €3.6 billion and €4 billion but I would delay making that decision.  If we come in ahead of schedule early in December and it appears that Europe has sorted out its mess, that it has a future and it will not be too heavily affected by the current crisis, we will probably come in ahead of schedule next year and I would not do more in that respect.  Our assessment is that the prospect of growth in the medium term is reasonable.  Once the fiscal adjustment is completed, one will see things come right rapidly.  The Government would have a surplus in 2016, 2017 and 2018.  I may be wrong.  Growth or the recovery could be slower to occur but there is some leeway.  Having experienced the misery of moving from a €7.5 billion austerity package in July 2010 to one of €15 billion in December 2010, one does not want to have to return to the people to tell them one got it wrong and that circumstances are worse than predicted.  One needs to have some leeway.  One should wait until December and operate on the basis of a figure between €3.6 billion and €4 billion.On the issue of front-loading, or enduring more misery now, which a number of commentators are recommending, one could say that if we get it all over with now, people will suddenly wake up in 2013 and say the nightmare is over.  Deputy Twomey referred to the importance of consumption.  There is an argument for this but there is a risk associated with putting more people out of work now in the hope that more jobs will be created later.  There is a fine balance to be struck but it is a bit too early to do so.  The figure will be within a relatively narrow range, unless new information about the Irish economy emerges that states circumstances are much worse than we believed.  Everything that has happened in the past nine months suggests circumstances are probably slightly better than expected in Ireland, whatever about the European Union as a whole.Deputy Twomey stated income tax and VAT rates have peaked.  We do not want more austerity than we need.  Fortunately, we have a wonderfully generous and very large EU-IMF umbrella to last until the end of 2013.  While the measures are not easy, they do not have to be implemented all at once.We have now gone into detail on what we do.  The tax changes made should be as employment friendly as possible, or as little unfriendly to jobs as possible.  The same applies to cuts and expenditure.  There was a theory that if one knocks hell out of the economy, it grows more rapidly.  Last autumn, the IMF, in a very good review of the literature, stated this is not the case based on evidence gleaned from Irish data from the 1980s.  If one knocks hell out of the economy, it is hell.  What was called expansionary fiscal contraction is a delusion.  Although cutting expenditure is pretty serious, it has a lesser impact on the economy in Ireland than it would have in larger economies.  Many of the IMF-EU commentaries expected growth to be substantially lower in Ireland as a result of the cuts.  While they have been pretty awful, they are not as awful as might be expected elsewhere because when people spend less, they spend less on imports.  Much of the adjustment has fallen.  One reason we have a balance-of-payments surplus is because we have stopped spending and buying imports to the extent we used to.The only way we will get out of this mess and return to job creation is through spending and investment.  Exports provide the platform.  The balance-of-payments surplus will allow us to expand consumption and investment in a pretty dramatic way.  The bigger the surplus in 2015, the greater the recovery will be in the period 2015 to 2020.  However, spending by consumers or households and investment in Ireland are tax-revenue intensive and jobs intensive.  I hope to see some recovery in the jobs market driven by exports in the coming two or two and a half years, assuming the European Union sorts itself out, but the real factors that will make a big hole in unemployment will be consumer spending and confidence that money can be made by investing in Ireland.The problem is that we are all depressed.  The story I am telling – I am not infallible – may not be believed by many.  Many outside Ireland do not believe it but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  It is only when matters evolve and better news emerges steadily that people will believe it.  One needs to take measures that will do as little damage to employment as possible.  Whatever one does will damage employment.  If one tightens fiscal policy, it has a negative impact.  The problem is that if we do not do so, we will go bust and the debt-to-GDP ratio will mushroom.Deputy Doherty asked about promissory notes.  It appeared to me as if somebody had a great idea, a wheeze, to keep Anglo Irish Bank out of the national debt figures.  It did not work and involves really complicated accounting.  It is a case of mirrors; instead of looking good in this one, one looks bloody awful.  It is very difficult to work out what is going on.Essentially, the hole in the bad banks was estimated to be €35 billion in the early part of last year.  It was said this would have to be paid off over a period.  The promissory notes system was then set up.  There was an unpleasant surprise, however, because the interest on the notes had to be the market interest rate.  The figures were calculated based on a 4% interest rate but, by the time the system was in place, there was a 6% interest rate.  However, that money is being paid into what, unfortunately, the people of Ireland own, that is, the remains of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  We are planning to pay in more than was estimated to be necessary in March of last year.What happens in the end?  It was interesting that the CEO of Anglo Irish Bank suggested in August that eventual losses could amount to €1.5 billion less than predicted.  What will happen if we put in too much is that, at some point – it will be a few years before we can have any certainty on this – there will be a repayment on a tiny part of the losses of the bank.  With regard to the cost to the State, the interest payments are too high in respect of Anglo Irish Bank.  Unfortunately, we wholly own the bank and are paying in more than is probably necessary.  There are different approaches given the complicated accounting procedures.  There was an interesting and relevant paper in the last Central Bank quarterly by Mick Lucey of the CSO and an individual from the Central Bank stating accounting in respect of this issue may change.The refunding of the promissory notes was raised.  At present, we are paying 3.5%.  If we returned to the markets and paid 5%, it would be more expensive but it would be less expensive than the cost of paying what we are paying on the promissory notes.  If one replaced all the promissory notes today with debt at 5%, the actual interest bill would be smaller.  Ultimately, the liability of the Irish taxpayer would be unchanged because the money would be paid into a black hole.  The black hole, however, would throw out something at the end.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I welcome Professor FitzGerald's comments.  The promissory note can be broken into three parts, the first of which is the capital repayment, the €3 billion that will be paid every March.  Everybody assumes this will mount to €30 billion over ten years.  This is incorrect as the repayment period is over 20 years.  This results in annual figures of perhaps €2 billion in capital and €1 billion in interest because Anglo Irish Bank has borrowed the money elsewhere to deal with its current problems.  In total, the transfers to Anglo Irish Bank between now and 2031 will amount to €47 billion.  They will constitute interest payments to the bank and the capital.  The Minister does not refute this.For us to pay Anglo Irish Bank every March, we need to borrow the money.  This is separate from the interest we are paying to it.  Is it not the case that there is an additional expense?  The Department of Finance, in December or November last year, referred to the cost of borrowing, which sum is in addition to the €47 billion.  Therefore, while it is accurate to suggest the transfer between the Exchequer and Anglo Irish Bank will total €47 billion, the cost to the Exchequer will be €75 billion because we need to borrow the money and pay interest to the markets in order to transfer the money in the first instance.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Deputy Doherty is quite correct.  In section 4 or 5 of our article, we include the €3 billion per year that must be refunded.  We refund it at the marginal interest rate.  We are probably being too pessimistic by including a rate of 6% for the period after 2013.  That is probably too high.  If we are paying at a rate of 6%, it will amount to a considerable sum of money.  The Deputy is quite correct about that.  Anglo Irish Bank will cost us a lot of money in the future, and issues arise as to how we can minimise this cost.  There are complexities to be considered.  The €3 billion we are to borrow each year to repay the debt amounts to a real cost, but it is a question of what one gets back at the end.  I would prefer to state up-front that we will only put what we need into Anglo Irish Bank rather than put in extra money only to discover suddenly in 2020 that we are getting back 10%.

While I am unsure whether he already has dealt with it, I seek his views on what is happening in Europe at present.  What does he believe is needed to bring about stability, in terms of a firewall, within the EFSF?  Second, I note Professor FitzGerald made reference to the domestic economy in his presentation.  What does he think would be required to get the domestic economy, in terms of consumer demand, moving again?  Our public finances are under control, exports are doing well and I welcome Professor FitzGerald's comments on the lag time between export growth and job creation and how such jobs are now coming.  Consequently, I seek his views on the domestic market.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	11	First, the professor might give his opinion on what I took to be the position of the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, today-----
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Sorry, as is my practice, I certainly will not constrain any questions.  However, while Professor FitzGerald may answer in any way he chooses, the invitation the joint committee extended to him is on foot of the paper he produced recently on the debt dynamic and on which he has elaborated today.  This is an information session with him and if he wishes to extend beyond that and answer questions on what he thinks about what a Minister or the Taoiseach might say, that is fine.  However, the Deputy should understand the context in which he is in attendance, which pertains to the article he has produced and the presentation he made today and this really is an information session based on that.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The question pertains to debt and our attitude towards debt.  The Taoiseach and the Minister of State surprised me somewhat today by suggesting it was bad for Greece to get a 50% to 60% write-down of its debt.  I find that to be bizarre as it seems to make a point of principle about Ireland not wishing to go down that road.  Does the professor have a view on whether it would be a good idea for Ireland or anyone else who is faced with this debt burden to get a 50% or 60% write-down on debt?  I ask in particular because many people think it is not really our debt anyway but has been forced on us as a result of the behaviour of banks.  While I may be missing something, I find it difficult to understand how anyone looking at a debt issue could perceive a 50% or 60% write-down of debt as not being desirable.Second, on the issue of growth, I note the professor's handout suggests that everything depends on eurozone stability and so on.  I refer to the scenario in which growth begins to contract in Europe for whatever reason.  Many people, myself included, would argue strongly that the impact of further austerity measures of the sort seen in Greece being applied to, for example Italy or elsewhere in the eurozone, as a consequence of the need to recapitalise banks, can have no other effect but to contract growth across Europe.  Does the professor have an opinion on this?  Can austerity have any other impact, if it is generalised across Europe, other than contracting growth?  If this is the case, would this not choke off the single bright spark on the Irish horizon to which he has pointed, namely, the export-led growth that is taking place?  Europe is one of our key markets and if there is contraction in the European economy, we basically are banjaxed and it throws everything else out.Following on from this point, I refer to the professor's comments on the question of stimulus as an alternative to the austerity approach.  In reference to stimulus and public works programmes, he characterised fiscal stimulus measures by the State, in a manner often used by the Government when the suggestion is put to it, as the caricature of digging holes in the road for no purpose.  I put it to him that anyone who proposes fiscal stimulus would not argue for digging pointless holes in the road.  Filling in a few holes might be of more benefit but digging them appears somewhat pointless.  Most seriously, why would one argue against the merits of serious investment by the State in key strategic areas?  I refer to the development of infrastructure or strategic areas such as, for example, developing domestic sustainable power sources that would reduce our dependence on imported energy.  Given that Ireland has a high dependence on imported energy, would this not be a worthwhile, beneficial and profitable enterprise for the State to engage in and seriously crank up its investment?  One could go through other suggestions, such as developing the agrifood sector and many others one could list.  Would so doing not be better and would it not be beneficial from the perspective of growth?This is particularly pertinent because it is absolutely necessary for economic growth to have investment.  I do not know whether the professor disputes that and cannot discern how anyone could.  Is it not the case that what probably has been the major contributing factor to the recession in Ireland has been a collapse in investment?  The professor can probably provide better figures but having read the Central Bank quarterly report recently, there has been a catastrophic collapse in investment by approximately two thirds.  Those who have money to invest are not so doing.  As the State is giving its money to banks and bondholders, it has no money to invest.  If one does not invest, one simply will not achieve growth.  Consequently, we need to invest.Lastly, I refer to a subject that is rarely discussed.  The professor has stated that austerity measures are not things we want to be obliged to do and if one does too many of them, they will have a detrimental effect on the domestic economy.  However, it is pretty clear they are having such a detrimental effect.  A big problem is a lack of investment from those who have funds to invest and a lack of spending by those who have savings.  I note the reason most of those at the lower or middle end are not spending is not because they are saving but because they do not have any money.  In this context, would it not be reasonable to suggest that part of a policy of getting funds to invest back into the economy should be to tax those with assets and wealth who are not investing at present and who are not spending but who appear to have sufficient surplus money to effectively hoard it?  In a certain sense, such people have gone on strike in terms of spending or investing in the economy when that money is desperately needed.  Consequently, we should talk about taxing wealth.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I welcome our visitor and acknowledge this is not the first time I have benefitted from hearing Professor John FitzGerald speak.  If I may, I wish to put a few propositions to him.  First, export-led growth is heavily concentrated on pharmaceuticals and I wonder about growth in this regard.  In the last set of figures, even the computer sector, or office machinery as the CSO rather quaintly calls it, was down.  On the food side, the movement primarily pertains to price rather than quantity.  Moreover, the OECD is pessimistic that we have just about maintained our share and reports of an Irish export-led boom are somewhat exaggerated, although I suppose we need some good news.  Investment will take some time because so much rotten investment was undertaken by the private sector, which is why the banks went broke.  I do not believe the Department of Finance was much better at it either.  We used to boast that the public capital programme as a percentage of GDP was double that of any other country.  Perhaps they knew more than we did.  The result has been excesses such as empty airports and vast motorway capacity with roads designed for 55,000 users per day but only 4,000 are using them.  It will be a long while before there is an investment revival.We did not do project appraisal well in the public or private sector.  The public sector needs a central office of project evaluation, COPE, because investment projects are an escape from the current budget constraints, the victims of lobbyists and Departments wishing to expand.  The sheer lack of economic expertise is acknowledged in the Wright report which pointed out how only 7% of the staff in the Department of Finance had qualifications in economics.  That was the best Department; I am sure the figure is minuscule in others.  One cannot have investments emanating from that lack of expertise either in the private or the public sector.  With ghost estates, there is a huge overhang of dud investments which will take a long time to be replaced by more sensible ones.Stephen Cecchetti claims Ireland faces three debt crises, of which household debt is actually larger than the Government's debt.  One of the results of the explosion of credit is that the household sector is being hammered to the tune of 119% of GDP, while the Government's debt is 111%.  Accordingly, there cannot be a consumption-led revival because people cannot spend as they are too busy working to pay off these debts, fearing what the Government will do with taxes and other noises in the background such as providing for their children's university education.It was claimed the economic outlook had improved a little since April.  The April estimates put the date of our return to 2008 nominal GDP figures at 2015.  When will there be real GDP?  Will it be in 2018 or even 2020?  This has to be coupled with the investment overhang and the fact that people are afraid or simply unable to consume.  The word "confidence" is devalued because it was used to pump up house prices.  When anyone refers to the need to restore confidence, people remember that that was the PR talk that bankrupted the country the last time.  Perhaps we need a new term other than "consumer confidence" that is not identified with the talking up of house prices in which the media and everybody else engaged between 2000 and 2008.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Regarding consumer demand, households are repaying debt at a substantial rate.  It is one reason we are running a balance of payment surplus.  It is difficult to estimate at what stage they will have rebuilt their balance sheets.  In other words, we do not know when they will have paid down enough debt or built up sufficient financial savings in order that they can go out and spend.  It could be 2014, but much of this depends on confidence.It must also be remembered that while 20% of households are very badly affected as a result of negative equity and so forth, 80% of households, like mine, have paid off their mortgages.  Many in their late 20s were wise enough or too young to go into the housing market.  We have never had a 30 to 35 years cohort with large financial assets and no houses.  At some point, if the economy recovers, people in this cohort will want to spend this additional cash on a house.  We know this process occurred elsewhere.  The problem is we do not know when it will change.It would be great if we could restore the financial position of all households, especially those in negative equity.  If the 80% of other households decide to spend, the economy will take off.  We need to look at a broader range of figures.  Currently, I do not see people being happy or confident about spending.  Neither are those who could afford to buy a house doing so because they believe house prices will fall further.  There is an uncertainty, but it is about human behaviour also.  As people learn, the economic models from before may not work in a new context.  We do know that people in their early 30s will not continue building up financial assets but will want to buy a dwelling.  When this happens, we will see real recovery in the economy.Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about default and writing down debt.  Let us take the scenario of Ireland defaulting on 100% of its debt.  Next year the difference between our expenditure and revenue will be €10 billion.  Where are we going to get that €10 billion?  As we cannot print it, we will have to borrow it.  No one will lend to a country that has defaulted on an EU-IMF agreement.  Other economists have suggested the default option would be like going cold turkey but having to cut €10 billion would make the austerity measures too painful.  It would create a cycle of reduced spending, falling tax revenues, more people unemployed and increased social welfare payments.  If we were to go cold turkey next year, the figure for cuts would come in at €15 billion on top of the planned reduction of €3.6 billion.  That would be just horrendous.When Deputy Mathews raised the structured default option with the Minister for Finance, his reply suggested he did not believe he would be able to pull this one off in the European Union.  Argentina which defaulted in 2002 is still being pursued all over the place.  Greece is hoping to secure agreement on its default which would reduce the burden somewhat.  However, as many have pointed out, the pain in Greece is far worse than the pretty awful pain being endured here.I do not see default as a realistic option.  We can get out of this mess with a limited amount, by European standards, of additional pain and still maintain our independence.  Going down the other route would just lead to a decade or more of problems.  It is up to the people, however, to decide what they want to do.  I am just quantifying the impacts of the alternative approaches.The Deputy is correct that the austerity programme is hurting in Italy.  If the European Union had acted promptly and in a sufficient way to deal with the Greek crisis 18 months ago, Ireland and Portugal might not be in the position they are in today; certainly Italy and Spain would not be.  Italy behaved in a sustainable fashion, although some economists would argue it could have done better.  The Italians now have to restore market confidence.  We know it is very painful to buy back the confidence of the rest of the world in order that they will lend to us on the open market at a reasonable rate of interest.  Unfortunately, austerity in Europe will make life difficult for us, as Deputy Doherty said.  Would that it were otherwise.  It might have been otherwise if wiser policies had prevailed.In terms of stimulus, I think Reagan economics was tried and failed.  The self-financing tax cut does not work in terms of a stimulus.  The idea was that one could stimulate the economy and it would pay for itself.  It will not; it just builds up more debt, which at some stage in the future means a bigger amount of austerity to get out of the mess.  Self-financing tax cuts were tried by Ronald Reagan in the US and did not prove that successful.The Deputy was quite right to point out that it was a rather flippant remark of mine to say "digging holes and filling in again".  My colleagues and I have done work over the past 20 years to try to look at how the State should target its investment in a way that produces a high rate of return.  One does not do things that will not produce a good rate of return.  For example, I suspect the social return from a new children's hospital, whatever the location, would probably warrant that investment.  One might well say investing in completing the road between Cork and Limerick or between Limerick and Galway might produce a high rate of return.  However, the interest rate of 3.5% is not the problem.  We are facing a situation where we will get back into the markets and we have assumed, probably pessimistically, we will pay 6% if we do everything we plan to do and it all works.  One needs a high rate of return on any investment and, therefore, the hurdle one faces on investment has gone way up.  If it does not, we should cease to invest but one must be much pickier in what one invests in.The other thing, which my colleague, Edgar Morgenroth, showed, was that the number of jobs created through investment in different areas does not tend to be that great.  For example, people build a new hospital but it needs a load of equipment and a lot of the money will flow out.  If one wanted to created short-term jobs with €1 billion, one would probably spend it in other ways in terms of active labour market measures, retraining or whatever.  If it is just jobs one wants to create, capital is used in the short run.  The reason one spends the money on investment is it creates jobs in the long run, but the problem is the high cost of capital at the moment means the rate of return has gone way up.I have published extensively that even if the rate of interest were low, investing in more renewable energy over and above what is planned would increase the costs for Ireland and would not do anything for global warming.  We will do a lot of renewable energy but going beyond this is not just bad value for money, it has a negative rate of return.  However, there are places where the State should invest and will continue to invest which will product a good rate of return that would warrant it.  The problem is we have had to cut back because the rate of return has gone down, not up, and the cost of the funds has gone way up.Taxing those with assets and tax penalties for not making good use of one's funds can be looked at.  I would have to go back and look at the Commission on Taxation report and what it looked at in this area.  We need to look at areas in the tax system where we can raise more money without damaging jobs and possibly incentivising more productive economic behaviour.  The problem has been that all the tax write-offs we have had in the past, which the previous Commission on Taxation recommended against in the early 1980s but was steadily ignored for the following period, cost us a load of money and got us into the mess we are in.  One needs to be careful in what one chooses.Senator Barrett referred to the concentration in certain areas regarding exports.  It is a concern but the thing that has surprised about the numbers for this year is the traditional manufacturing sector has grown and Irish firms have grown in manufacturing.  I was in Hanoi 18 months ago for work earning some foreign exchange for Ireland.  I was in a café and the guy at the table beside me asked me whether I was Irish.  He was Irish and he was there with 12 other companies and Enterprise Ireland facilitated by the embassy selling IT software.  One of them made a big sale and it was interesting to talk to them.  They were successful and they were all relatively small Irish-owned companies selling into an Asian market.  Subsequently, another colleague attended a conference in Ho Chi Minh city in May, which I could not attend for various reasons, where Irish firms were present.  We are seeing a move in IT services, pharmaceuticals, health care products, food processing and now some other sectors.  We need more of this.The OECD study looked at our loss of market share but it does not go up to today and we have improved competitiveness, but the effects of improving competitiveness have a long lag, given the costs of pricing ourselves out of markets over the past decade, which we complained about in many reports.  We could see the problem coming and then when the crisis hit, all the problems hit us.  We have made a big change.  The benefits of this will show up in future years.  However, exports have had a good recession, all things considered, because we are in certain sectors. They are doing reasonably well but I am nervous about what is happening in the rest of Europe.  The markets could be very unfavourable next year and that is why we need a resolution reasonably rapidly.  Senator Barrett also asked a question about household debt but I have answered that.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	16	In the page of conclusions, the relevant word is "deleverage".  Citizens who are in debt are taking their wages to deleverage, putting it across the balance sheet to pay off the moneys they owe.  Unfortunately for the economy, nobody is getting a bite of that money at any stage.  The banks are also obliged to deleverage over a set period agreed with the troika.  Professor FitzGerald stated the banks will not lend money but that is because they are worried about their balance sheets.  It is not a criticism of the citizenry.  If one owes money, one will pay it off if one is in a position to do so.  My criticism is we have a formula or agreement and we are sticking to it.  As a result of the formula, banks must deleverage over a set period and they are not lending.With regard to the construction sector, only 13,000 mortgages will be lent this year, which is the same number as in 1971 when the population was 3 million.  According to this year's census, the population is 4.5 million, a 50% increase.  We are cutting our own throats and the agreement in place needs to be reviewed in respect of the time schedule for the deleveraging of the banks.  If that is not reviewed, they will not lend. What are Professor FitzGerald's views on that?  When the covered banks were recapitalised, €6 billion was provided to write down the mortgage loan book.  When AIB officials appeared before the committee, they stated they had written down €600,000 this year, which is practically nothing.  The banks are funding nothing beyond what they previously funded and have agreed to refund.  During a period in which we are trying to encourage people to spend in a difficult downturn recession, if we do not encourage the banks and give them the option to increase the period of time for leveraging they will not lend.  I would like to hear the witnesses views on this.
#AideenHayden	unknown-#AideenHayden-party	unknown-#AideenHayden-dob	unknown-#AideenHayden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Like everyone else, I welcome Professor FitzGerald and thank him for his up-beat analysis which is refreshing.In the coming weeks we will all turn our attention to the upcoming budget, and Professor FitzGerald has given broad brush strokes on it.  With regard to the most effective way of achieving the cuts and austerity we are discussing while at the same time achieving a return to growth, where does Professor FitzGerald believe the balance should lie?  Will he be more specific than he was previously?  Will he speak about direct and indirect taxation bands and rates?  Does he support a new higher rate wealth tax?  Where does he think specifically the axe should fall?Professor FitzGerald mentioned that domestic demand is more employment intensive, and a clear corollary of this is that anything we can do to encourage domestic demand will be more employment productive.  What is his view on the introduction of a new rate of VAT specifically to try to target luxury goods?  Issues may arise at European level but assuming we could achieve consent for it, does he think it would be a good strategy?  What is his view on the new rate of tax introduced recently to stimulate demand in the tourist-driven sectors of the market?  Does he think it is effective.  Is it the type of measure we should consider?Professor FitzGerald spoke about domestic demand, consumption and spending.  The banks, particularly those we directly support, will have an important part to play in this.  Does Professor FitzGerald believe the banks as they are currently structured are fit for purpose or are we returning to the type of banking we had in the 1960s and 1970s when one could not cross the threshold unless one had one's communion money in one's bank account?A housing debt issue which came to my attention recently was with regard to people who emigrated to Australia who told me they send home money to keep their houses from being repossessed.  To what extent will emigrants' remittances be a feature of the Irish balance sheet in the coming years?
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I welcome Professor FitzGerald.  I have had respect for him since he was two years ahead of me in school and I continue to do so.We are speaking about debt dynamics but today's conversation has spread to other areas including exports.  I want to concentrate on debt dynamics in the context of the book Endgame, written by John Mauldin who was in Dublin several weeks ago.  It deals with the debt super-cycle, the composition of debt and Cecchetti’s presentation to the Wyoming conference in August which was mentioned by Senator Barrett.  This presentation was with regard to a review done by Bank for International Settlements, BIS, economists of 18 OECD economies from 1980 to 2010 examining the relationship to GDP and growth of the individual and combined elements of debt comprising household debt; non-financial corporate debt which is business debt; and national debt or sovereign or fiscal debt.  Roughly speaking, the conclusions were that when government debt increased to more than 100%, household debt increased to more than 85% and business debt increased to more than 90% which is a total of 275% of GDP one entered very bad uphill territory where growth would probably disappear and economies stagnate and even contract.In answer to a parliamentary question I received figures for Irish household debt and business non-financial debt.  Using a slightly different denominator for indicative and scale comparisons - that is using GNP rather than GDP and the argument and reconciliation between the two is another day's discussion - Ireland's combined debt under these three headings totals 494% of GNP which puts us at the top of the table produced by the BIS economists.  Greece was only in the middle of the table with a combined debt of 273%.  This means the main element in its combined debt is sovereign debt.Our country blew it first.  The explosion occurred here because the credit bubble had been so turbo-charged that when the contraction of liquidity markets occurred everything fell off.  Notwithstanding this, the Government of the day refused to recognise what the scale of losses was going to be.  The scale of losses determines what solution should be addressed and what debt write-downs should occur when restructuring begins.  Given that it took almost three years, even to the end of March this year following the second PCAR report, we were encouraged to accept that the €24 billion capitalisation would suffice.  Two weeks ago AIB came before the committee and stated it had written off only €600,000 of what it indicated was a €6 billion provision to be trickled in over a number of years to shock-absorb its losses.  This suggests that perhaps the PCAR is not enough.  AIB should be able to boast it is fully capitalised with tons of capital shock-absorbers and should start writing off fast to spread back the debt write-downs to its customers' households and businesses, but it is not doing so.I am receiving an increasing wave of telephone calls, including from panicked people such as one I received yesterday about a modest company which could cause a write-off of approximately €10 million, because everything is creaking to a halt.  This is not an isolated case.  The wave is getting bigger.  I do not agree with the analysis that 20% of the households in the economy are under water and under severe strain while the other 80% have equity and perhaps did not borrow.  The psychology of the country is such that the owner occupiers of what might have been a house worth €1 million four years ago now know that at best it is worth €300,000.  This is why for a very long time there will not be any increase in consumer spending.The French Government has the nerve to state we should carry the umbrella of generosity for the deficit discussed earlier of €10 billion a year by shock-absorbing it with a sudden fiscal adjustment.  I disagree.  We provided an umbrella of €75 billion by not recognising the scale of losses in our banks when there would not have been the possibility - a dream possibility - of paying back and redeeming in full the senior bondholders in the two-year period up to earlier this year.  There would not have been a chance of this.  The entire crisis would have fast-forwarded to the situation now, when Europe is staring at the Greek losses write-off.  France is stating it will not put it on its economy but on its banks and the economies of Europe can take it pro rata according to their strengths.  This is wrong.We must examine honestly the provenance of where we are at and how the situation arose.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I must ask Deputy Mathews to put a question.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I agree with the representative of Roubini Global Economics who stated on Bloomberg recently that because of the debt super-cycle which occurred over a 25 to 30 year period, the entire calibration of assets, financing of the assets and debt obligations must be written down in an arrangement whereby a reservoir is created - to use an analogy - probably amounting to €3 trillion for Europe, of which €1 trillion is needed immediately.  Anything else is codology.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Deputy, I presume you are asking Professor FitzGerald whether he agrees with that.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Yes, does he agree?  That is the question.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	23	We really have to move on.

The taxation and cutting debate, raised by Senator Hayden, is very interesting.  Recent up-to-date revenue reports-----
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	27	A question, please, Deputy.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Okay.  Would the witness agree that there is an opportunity to introduce a 4% super or additional income tax for incomes over €140,000 per year for a period of four years, contemporaneous with the troika agreement or the fiscal adjustment period?  The reason I make that suggestion is that there are 190 taxpayers in this country who earn over €2 million per year.  A tax of 4% on incomes over €140,000 per year would bring in almost €2 billion.  That is a lot out of the cuts and it would not have a negative effect on consumer spending and growth in the economy.Finally, it is good to hear about export-led companies in the pharmaceutical sector, which is mainly foreign direct investment, FDI, owned business.  I am also delighted to hear about the small and medium-sized companies whose representatives the witness met in China.  As regards energy, we must look at the programmes for energy investment and so forth but the big challenge is not the electrical grid but that a large element of our energy costs are for locomotion, that is, motor cars and machines that are not so easily plugged in.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The committee has had a great deal of discussion about the mortgage and debt situation across the board, and particularly household debt.  You will be aware of the Keane report and some of the proposals being put forward relating to, perhaps, mortgage write-downs.  You made the interesting point earlier that the banks had been transformed from being a liability to an asset and that you hoped we might eventually be able to sell them and get some money.  Could mortgage write-down programmes have an impact on that prospect in terms of the asset value of the banks for the State, given that we have such a high level of ownership in them?  I will leave it at that as you have much to deal with.  We will have to conclude then.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I have one last question on the banks-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	35	In response to Senator D'Arcy and Senator Hayden, we need the banks back lending and the Senators identified problems in that area.  Regarding the details of the budget, I had not prepared my thoughts on that as I was thinking more about debt sustainability.  Economists would not be keen on different VAT rates or a luxury rate because it would discourage people from spending in the future.  People are much more sensitive in their spending behaviour on luxury goods than they are in spending on food.  I am not proposing it as it would not be acceptable, but one could probably get away with a much lower VAT rate if one had the same rate on everything, including food.  However, that is something we would rule out.  I am not keen on messing with the VAT rates.On higher rates of tax, there are a number of ways of getting revenue from people who are better off.  The research shows that tax rates that go above 50% tend to have negative effects.  However, one can get money out of rich people by a targeted property tax; there are other ways of doing this.  In terms of income distribution effects, we need to examine it but we must at all times ensure that the tax system is employment friendly and does not discourage people from doing business or working in Ireland.The issue you raised, Chairman, is interesting.  There is a tension there whereby every €100,000 of debt one forgives for somebody when they could actually pay it is €100,000 of taxpayers' money.  If we had €1 billion to spend on the people who are in desperate housing situations in Ireland, the 80,000 on the housing lists and a range of other areas, we eventually want to get our money back from the banks.  There is no question that there is an issue with people who cannot pay and the Keane report has dealt with this.  I hear people say that because we have given the banks money, the banks should give out that money.  However, the banks are us, the taxpayers.  We own them.  We put €30 billion into the solvent banks and if we can get back the majority of that €30 billion, it will transform the debt situation in the future.To refer to my presentation and what Deputy Mathews said, it will not be easy but we will pay back the debt.  The economy is on a sustainable growth path.  Growth has come back and it is surprisingly vigorous.  It surprised not so much my colleagues but the IMF and the EU that it has been so vigorous this year.  The proof is there.  With regard to sustainability, yes we can do it and are doing it.  The gross debt to GDP ratio will begin to fall from next year and in net terms from 2013.  That is the proof that it is sustainable, and that is combined with growth.The household indebtedness affects some households.  It is interesting that the household sector financial assets, excluding housing, are worth substantially more than its liabilities.  If one looks at the net figures, the net financial assets of households have risen substantially in the last three years.  It is not a simple equation.  When one looks at gross indebtedness, the two countries with the highest household indebtedness in Europe are Denmark and the Netherlands, which have been doing notably well through this recession.  Therefore, it is not a simple exercise of high levels of gross household debt meaning one cannot grow.  I believe the economy can grow out of this.To return to the issue you raised, Chairman, getting the money back from the banks is the key to debt sustainability in the long term.  It will mean that instead of having to engage in a war of attrition over 50 years to get the debt to GDP ratio down, it could be brought down with a rush.  We must examine the tension between getting the economy back up and running and getting our money back from the banks, relative to dealing with the awful problem of households that have major mortgage issues.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee.  We are here to provide an overview of the detailed empirical work the Central Bank has conducted in the residential mortgage area.  We are not here to represent the views of the Central Bank or the European system of central banks.I will give the background to this detailed loan level data.  In early 2011, loan loss assessments under conservative, base and stressed case scenarios were carried out on the loan books of four Irish credit institutions.  The results were used in the prudential capital assessment review exercise, PCAR II, to calculate the level of capital required to stabilise the Irish banking sector.  Along with details of the future deleveraging of the Irish banks, these were published in the financial measures programme, FMP, in March 2011.  This analysis was facilitated by the disclosure of the financial institutions' loan books.  Detailed loan-level data, as of 31 December 2010, was gathered on the credit portfolios of the four institutions involved, covering residential mortgages, corporate, small and medium enterprise, SME, corporate real estate, CRE, and non-mortgage consumer lending.  The aim of our presentation today is to provide an overview of the structure and condition of the mortgage loan books of the four credit institutions assessed in the 2011 FMP.  With the scale and range of data available, analysis is possible across a variety of different areas such as borrower categories, interest rate profiles, repayment structures, property types, arrears accruals and the regional distributions of these loan and borrower characteristics across Ireland.  To this end, a recent conference hosted by the Central Bank on 13 October included four presentations by Central Bank staff with accompanying papers looking at many of these issues.  The conference website has been included in our documentation and all presentations and papers can be downloaded from the site and contain more detail than we can provide here.We have drawn nine key points from the work we have done with the loan level information.  The statistics on the first two points relate to all institutions regulated by the Central Bank and the statistics on which the remaining points are based relate to the four FMP institutions.  The arrears situation in the Irish mortgage market is one that has built up over the past three to four years.  It has coincided with a large increase in unemployment rates, from 4% to 14%, and a significant drop in household incomes.  We estimate that of those borrowers in arrears of more than 90 days, some 70% are in arrears of at least six months and 40% at least are in arrears of 12 months.  The arrears balances range from €20,000 to €26,000 on average.While the majority of borrowers are up to date on their mortgages, a sizeable number have experienced, and continue to experience, difficulty.  Data from the Central Bank for the end of June 2011 shows 55,763, or 7.2%, of owner-occupier residential mortgage loans in arrears of more than 90 days, amounting to 9.4% on a balance basis.For the four FMP institutions, on a balance basis, 50% of customers in arrears of more than 90 days are in the four banks included in the FMP.  Some 40% are in other non-sub-prime lending institutions and 10% are with sub-prime lenders.  These sub-prime lenders account for less than 2% of the stock of outstanding mortgage debt.  The figures are similar when we look at it on the basis of number of loans.One of the most important findings of our research is that a substantial proportion - we estimate 44% - of borrowers in more than 90 days arrears return to a no arrears situation after a 12-month period.  We are carrying out further research in this area, both in terms of what drives this result and how sustainable it is.The residential, or owner-occupier, mortgage market is only one side of the story.  From the beginning of the last decade onwards, there was a significant expansion in the buy-to-let segment of the Irish mortgage market.  At the end of 2010 we estimated this market to account for approximately one quarter of the total outstanding stock of mortgage debt.  The arrears rate in this market is roughly double that observed in the owner-occupier segment and continues to rise.  It is important to be aware that there is a significant degree of overlap between borrowers in both the owner-occupier and buy-to-let segments, and developments in one segment will affect outcomes in the other.   We estimate that approximately 40% of buy-to-let borrowers also have a non buy-to-let mortgage with the same lender, although this varies across institutions.Our research indicates that the main driver of mortgage arrears is affordability, for example, job loss, other income shocks, changes in family circumstances and changes to payment arrangements.  Housing equity, driven mainly by changes in house prices in the past number of years, also has a role to play, particularly in preventing a borrower in negative equity from trading out of the situation.The extent of negative equity receives considerable attention but it is important not to equate the degree of negative equity that exists with the key affordability problem facing people who have difficulty repaying their mortgages.  Below we present some facts about the intersection of the people in negative equity and arrears.  These are based on our analysis of data from the four banks included in the FMP.  The figures are for the owner-occupier segment only and use June 2011 house prices and the arrears position is as at end 2010.  We estimate that half of borrowers in arrears of more than 90 days are not in negative equity—although this does not mean the mechanism is necessarily there for them to realise any equity they might have.  Less than 10% of borrowers with negative equity are in arrears of more than 90 days as at the end 2010.  The time of this finding is important, given the likely changes since.  As of June 2011, we estimate some 35% of households with mortgages had negative equity, equal to €62,000 on average.  With approximately 620,000 mortgaged households, this aggregates to €14 billion across all financial institutions.  Negative equity is concentrated amongst certain cohorts of borrowers, for example, 88% of households with negative equity have loans that originated between 2004 and 2008.  First time buyers account for between 18 and 21% of owner-occupier loans.On a balance basis, the representation is higher at 40%.  Many of these people took out loans during the boom years.  We estimate that approximately 27.5% of balances - €32 billion - are first-time buyers originating between 2003 and 2007, again across all financial institutions.  On a balance basis, we find at the end of 2010, 84% of owner-occupier mortgages are on some form of variable rate - 54% on tracker, with an average balance €240,000 and 30% on standard variable, with an average balance €140,000.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	39	What are the aggregate loan balances in respect of those?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I would prefer to take questions when Dr. McQuinn is finished.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The other point which is of interest given the scale of information available, is that there is a significant regional dimension to the mortgage arrears issue and some interesting trends emerge when we look at this.  For example, while the Dublin and commuter regions account for the greatest proportion of the outstanding mortgage debt, they are under-represented in the 90-plus arrears population.  Other regions, such as the Border and midlands counties, have significantly higher arrears rates.  For instance, at the end of 2010, the 90-plus arrears rate for the midlands region was close to 9% on a balance basis.  The equivalent figures for Dublin and the south west were closer to 5%.  Regions that have experienced more significant negative economic shocks, such as higher unemployment rates, have higher arrears rates, which is not that surprising.Having highlighted some facts in regard to the owner-occupier segment, I will briefly summarise some of our research on the buy-to-let segment.  Much like the owner-occupier segment, loan performance in the buy-to-let segment is driven by economic developments.  However, the growth in the arrears rate in buy-to-let has more closely tracked and reacted more quickly to changes in key macro variables, such as the unemployment rate.  This is one reason we observe higher arrears rates in this segment of the market.  Another factor which we find can affect the performance of buy-to-let loans is rental rates.As at end 2010, we find that a substantial proportion of buy-to-let loans are interest only.  As a percentage of total balances with each segment, 57% of buy-to-let loans are interest only as compared with 10% for the owner-occupier segment.  On a loan basis, the figures are 42% and 6.4%, respectively.As at end 2010, approximately 60% of buy-to-let properties that are interest only are in negative equity, totalling €2 billion, or approximately €91,000 per property.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I welcome Dr. McQuinn and his colleagues from the Central Bank.  I compliment the Central Bank on the publication of the quarterly figures on mortgage arrears because that information provides an excellent foundation for policymakers and gives us a very good picture of the exact situation in quite a timely fashion and it is an invaluable tool for us in considering the Keane report and other reports on this issue before we come up with some solutions.In regard to the arrears statistics, Dr. McQuinn advised us that 70% of those in arrears of 90 days or more are at least six months in arrears and 40% are at least 12 months in arrears.  He said that based on the research, 44% of borrowers in 90-plus arrears returned to a no arrears situation after a 12 month period.  That is a remarkable statistic that almost one in two of those in arrears move out of that arrears situation within 12 months.  Will Dr. McQuinn give us a sense of what is happening there?  Is it that some of the mortgages recorded originally as being in arrears are being restructured by the borrower and the lender by agreement, are moving out of arrears and, in the next set of official statistics, are not being picked up as being in arrears?  Is there a statistical short term anomaly there which, in reality, is not the case?  I do not believe that almost one in two borrowers are really moving out of an arrears situation in a 12 month period.  Any additional comments Dr. McQuinn might like to make on that would be very helpful.In regard to buy-to-let mortgages, that seems to be a real crisis area.  Dr. McQuinn said the arrears rate in this market is roughly double that observed in the owner occupier segment.  When one considers that approximately one in eight owner-occupier mortgages is in some trouble, whether in arrears or restructured, that means possibly one in four or one in five of buy-to-let mortgages is in some difficulty.  That is a source of real concern.Dr. McQuinn also said that 57% of buy-to-let mortgages are paying interest only.  That should ring alarm bells for us as policymakers that there is a crisis coming down the tracks in terms of buy-to-let mortgages and they are not being reported in the quarterly figures published.  That 57% interest only compares to only 10% for owner-occupiers, so it highlights the stark difference and the quality of that loan book.Is Dr. McQuinn getting any information from the banks as to their engagement with buy-to-let borrowers?  Are they restructuring those mortgages and if so, how?  It is difficult to restructure them if the vast majority are already interest only.  While we know that, in nominal terms, the residential mortgage loan book is approximately €115 billion, do we have a corresponding figure for the buy-to-let mortgage loan book?  Perhaps it is in the detail of Dr. McQuinn's report but I did not see it.  How many billion euro is the nominal loan book on buy-to-let mortgages?In regard to negative equity, the report shows that while less than 10% of those in negative equity are in arrears of 90 days or more, half of those who are in arrears also happen to be in negative equity.  Perhaps 20,000 odd people are in a real crisis situation in that they are in arrears and are also suffering negative equity.Dr. McQuinn said 35% of households were in negative equity at the end of June of this year.  That picture is likely to deteriorate further given that property prices are continuing to fall and we have since had a further ECB rate increase, which may impact on their ability to repay.The information on arrears of 90 days or more is very useful.  I can understand why the Central Bank does not publish arrears statistics on people who are only 30 or 60 days in arrears because it may not be that meaningful in that people may just have missed one month's payment due to a cashflow issue.  Is the Central Bank receiving that information from the individual financial institutions?  Can Dr. McQuinn give us any sense of the picture there in terms of arrears of fewer than 90 days because that might give us an idea of what is coming down the tracks?  Unfortunately, many of those will progress to being 90 days or more in arrears.When will we have the next quarterly report giving the picture at the end of September?  Is the Central Bank receiving the reports from the banks on an ongoing basis?  How does that process work?  Do they send the full quarter end information at one point in time or does it come in on an ongoing or rolling basis?Although I am not sure if this is relevant to the Central Bank, does the PCAR assessment properly take account of the potential loan losses on the buy-to-let mortgage book as well?  I know it did for the residential mortgage loan book but did it properly take account of the buy-to-let market where there seems to be a real crisis brewing?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	43	A couple of issues occurred to me and one of them relates to what Deputy McGrath asked.  In regard to the scepticism Deputy McGrath expressed, if that is not being unfair to him, on the return to no arrears, over what period of time was this study conducted?  Given that things are changing so much at the moment, does one need to compare a period of time in which there is rapid change with one in which there is not?  What period does this study span?  Is there evidence that this interesting and striking pattern is continuing?  Is this current?  Is the ESRI predicting, on the basis of the information it has, that this is likely to continue?I mention two issues that arise from the eighth point that was made about the Irish mortgage market.  I was struck by the reference to the different experiences of Dublin and its commuter area on the one hand, and the Border and midlands counties on the other.  It might not be hugely surprising for some people that there is quite a difference between them.  Is there anything in the material the ESRI has seen that allows it to hazard an explanation for this difference?  Do they need to be interpreted separately?I read in the same paragraph that the 90-plus arrears rate for the midlands region is close to 9% whereas it is closer to 5% in Dublin and the south west.  Where would I find figures describing the norm in this regard?  What would the figures be if there was no crisis and no recession?  I assume some mortgages are in arrears, including some in arrears of more than 90 days, at all stages in economic life.  I am not asking the delegates to provide those figures now.  Is there somewhere we could find them to compare the experience now with what might be the norm?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I will start by responding to the questions asked about the fourth point on the Irish mortgage market, which was that 44% of those in arrears of more than 90 days have no arrears 12 months later.  Dr. Lydon can jump in here if he wishes.  The statistic in question comes from a conference paper on a study that was conducted by a colleague of ours, Mr. Robert Kelly.  If the joint committee is looking for more information, an entire paper on the subject was presented to the conference in question.  Mr. Kelly has looked at the patterns in this respect.  There is a time series dimension in some of the information we have.  It was not provided by all the institutions from which we gather information.  One institution provided some time period information that allows us to examine how patterns of arrears evolved over a relatively brief period.  Mr. Kelly used very sophisticated techniques to look at those trends and their evolution.  It was a kind of matrix approach that allowed him to study how many people went from zero to 60 days, from 60 to 90 days, from 90 to 180 days and from 180 to 360 days.  He looked at the change in the evolution of those patterns.  Essentially, he could clearly see from the data that the movement in question took place among 44% of borrowers in a certain group.  That was purely a statistical exercise, in the sense that it looked at the evolution of the data.  It was not related to any particular set of characteristics.  We could not relate it to the income levels or particular characteristics of the household.  It was purely data-observing, in that sense.  The potential reasons for this phenomenon are mere conjecture at this stage.  Deputy McGrath probably hit the nail on the head when he said some element of restructuring may be going on.  Clearly, that would have a role to play in this regard.  If the loan is restructured, it shows up in the data as a different type of situation.  Another potential explanation would be re-employment in the household.  Given the time period we are talking about, that is not likely to have been a significant driver or played a significant role in what may have occurred.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The time period in question was from December 2009 to December 2010.  The study looked at how those who were in arrears of 90 days in December 2009 transitioned over the year to December 2010.  I agree with what Mr. McQuinn said.  We expect that a substantial proportion went into one of the two main categories of forbearance, which are term extension and interest-only arrangements.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Is the period between December 2010 and December 2011 likely to be subject to the same study?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Yes.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I assume those figures will be available some time next year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Yes.  An ongoing exercise in the bank is looking at the possibility of getting this data on a more regular basis.  We got the 2010 data from a one-off exercise under the prudential capital assessment review, which was conducted earlier this year.  There are moves afoot to put this on a more sustainable basis.  Obviously, we would regard having this kind of information on a regular basis as the way forward.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	50	As Deputy McGrath said, such data would greatly assist everybody participating in the debate on these issues.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Very much so.  We know from Mr. Robert Kelly's analysis that having a year's extra information added greatly to the empirical rigour of what we did and enabled us to be far more robust in the conclusions we could draw.  It possibly enabled other variables to be brought in so there could be an examination of what exactly was driving 44% of people to move out of arrears.  It might have allowed for a consideration of whether restructuring or some other issue was at play.  It is likely that there will be further feeds of the data, as we call it, on a systematic basis in 2012.  Clearly, there will be a financial measures programme exercise next year.  Obviously, more regular feeds of the data will be used in that exercise as well.  Perhaps Mr. Lydon will talk about the buy-to-let issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	52	We will publish material all the time.  We will make sure we circulate it to the committee.  Material is coming out regularly, based on what we have and on data updates as they come in.  The question asked on the buy to let issue related to the size of the market.  I need to get a figure from Ms McCarthy before I can answer that question.  According to the presentation Ms McCarthy and I gave at the conference, the buy-to-let segment for the four banks included in the financial measures programme is approximately €12 billion in balance.  We estimated that it is approximately 50% of the market.  The whole buy-to-let market may be €22 billion or €24 billion.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I think it is less.  I think it is 57%.  It is a substantial proportion.  Much of that would be as a result of forbearance.  The loans in question would not have started as interest-only loans.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I will respond to some of the further points raised.  We were asked about arrears and negative equity.  That will be covered in one of the bank's imminent publications.  We release economic information through a variety of publications, including technical papers and - more recently - economic letters, which tend to be shorter.  They can be just six or seven pages long.  A publication to be released soon by one of our colleagues will basically draw out the arrears and negative equity situation.  It will examine and put numbers on the different cohorts.  One can think of it in terms of a matrix, setting out who is in negative equity and also in arrears, who is in negative equity but not in arrears and who is in arrears but not in negative equity.  The publication will put numbers on the various cohorts.  It should make a useful contribution to the debate by putting more information out there.  We will be able to update it regularly as we get further feeds of information.  Deputy McGrath also asked about the figures we publish relating to people in arrears of more than 90 days and the possibility of publishing information about people in arrears of 30 days or 60 days.  Perhaps Ms Mooney can comment on such issues.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Deputy McGrath asked a couple of questions about the quarterly mortgage arrears statistics.  We get them at a point in time, rather than on a continuous basis.  At the end of each quarter, we give the banks approximately 20 business days to get the data to us.  We then do an internal analysis to come up with the collective data.  The next series should be out the week after next.  We hope to have it out in early November.  We get information from the banks on arrears of less than 90 days.  We do not publish it for the reasons the Deputy mentioned, with which we agree.  If we were to rely on data relating to arrears of less than 90 days, we would change figures very quickly.  Many cases of arrears of less than 90 days are referred to as technical arrears.  They can arise when a person misses a direct debit, goes away on holiday or misses a payment for some other reason.  I do not have a figure to hand for the level of such arrears, but if the Deputy wants I am sure I can get something to him after the meeting.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Great.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I do not think one should rely on it.  The Deputy also asked whether we are gathering data on the buy-to-let issue.  We have not started collecting data on arrears on the buy-to-let side, although we are considering it.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	59	If the delegates propose to send any additional data to us, perhaps they can send them to the clerk to the committee.  We will make sure all members get them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I would like to return to two other issues.  The Chairman asked what the arrears rate would look like outside a period of crisis.  I refer the committee to my presentation to the conference, as set out in slide 5.  We tried to cobble together all of the data sources we have to present a more historical picture.  We have done so for the period from January 2004 until the end of 2010.  The year 2004 was a non-crisis year as arrears stood at less than 0.5%.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	61	In my experience, a non-crisis year is usually when the figure is less than 0.3%.

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	63	It is now 10%, which indicates a thirtyfold deterioration.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Deputy McGrath asked whether buy-to-let, BTL, mortgages featured in the PCAR.  Dr. McQuinn indicated we will not discuss policy.  I will make only two points.  First, the Governor is intimately familiar with all the research and analysis.  Speaking at the conference, he stated the capital is available and includes in this buy-to-let mortgages.  Having seen the figures, he is confident.  The other issue is that the PCAR and financial measures programme, FMP, figures show that, proportionately, a significantly larger amount has been allocated to BTL.  There is, therefore, a recognition that although BTL has a smaller share of the market, it has a much greater share of losses.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Does the PCAR provide an overall figure on recapitalisation to reflect possible losses on buy-to-let and residential mortgages?  The Governor is reluctant to give a view.  Is the figure provided under the PCAR up to €10 billion under the moderate scenario?  We need to know the figure.  I can go through the report to try to find a figure but the issue is complex.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The figure for Republic of Ireland mortgages is between €5 billion and €9 billion.  To be precise a capital shortfall of €24 billion was identified across the four institutions in the financial measures programme.  This was against total projected losses from 2011 to 2013 of between €20 billion and €27 billion.  Irish mortgages account for between €5.7 billion and €9 billion of these projected losses.  In the case of the €5.7 billion figure, the split between the owner occupier and BTL mortgages is €3.5 billion and €2.2 billion, respectively.  In the case of the adverse figure, the owner occupier figure is €5.7 billion while the buy-to-let figure is €3.3 billion.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Based on these figures, is it the case that up to €9 billion has been provided to recapitalise the banks to absorb potential mortgage losses in the buy-to-let and residential sectors?  Has this figure been factored into the overall recapitalisation?  The range of between €5.7 billion and €9 billion contributed to the overall figure of €24 billion.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	68	For the ultimate statement, I prefer to take what the Governor said.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The Governor stated that approximately €6 billion of the €24 billion figure was for potential mortgage losses.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Chairman asked a question about regional differences, which is a very interesting issue.  Rob Kelly, in his presentation, provided some interesting charts showing the position throughout the country.  This is a difficult issue to explain fully.  As we noted in the presentation, if one examines the unemployment trends, one sees clearly that the arrears position tends to map them.  One issue underlying the arrears and regional issues could be that one is witnessing the extreme of the commuter belt in some instances.  This is possibly where some of the difficulties are arising relative to the rest of the market.  If one looks at the map, one could say the problems arise in the Border and midlands areas but it could also be said that the problem is located very much at the extreme end of the commuter belt.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I thank the delegation for attending.  The presentation is good as it scratches the surface and digs a little deeper.  As a country - we are all in this together - we would serve our strategic thinking and planning best if we were to prescribe for all the banks a new management accounting formula or template for providing the information we need to manage the portfolio.  As Deputy McGrath correctly noted, we want the overall figure showing the exposure of the Irish people to mortgage, buy-to-let and household debt arising from their ownership of the banks.  We want to know how much was advanced and what are the arrears, including figures on mortgages that have been brought up-to-date through restructuring and so forth.  To save our guests the task of taking notes-----
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	72	As I am not sure if Deputy Mathews was present when the meeting commenced, I should clarify that while the visitors are from the Central Bank, this is a presentation they prepared.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	73	That is correct and I have thanked them for doing so.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	74	If the joint committee needs to make a representation or otherwise to the Central Bank, members may do so.  However, this is a specific study prepared by individuals who work in the Central Bank.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I am aware of that but given that members may not see the delegation again for some time, it is important to point out what could be helpful.  The Central Bank is prescriptive and regulates an industry that we hope has been hosed out.  We want to disinfect the banking industry using lots of Dettol.  We also want loan books that we can trust.  I ask the delegation kindly to organise a prescriptive template for management accounting and tell the banks they want the figures to be coterminous, in other words, they do not want to be given information in respect of different dates.  We are in charge of the banks and own the shares in them.I read in the newspapers that Bank of Ireland is wondering out loud whether it needs another €2.4 billion.  This is extremely disappointing given that on 31 July-----
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I ask the Deputy to listen to me for a moment.  The issue he raises is not relevant to this session.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I believe it is relevant.  The Chairman should ask our visitors if they would like to hear it.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	78	They may respond if they wish.  Nevertheless, I ask Deputies to confine their remarks to the agenda, which is to obtain some value from the report our guests prepared.  Members may wish to raise certain issues on the margins but they should focus their questions on the report.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Has the right report been prepared?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The joint committee will be able to discuss the big picture many times in future.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	81	This is my area of understanding and expertise.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	82	While I do not doubt that is the case, I ask the Deputy please to ask questions on the report.  Time is moving on.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Are we getting the right report, namely, the one we need to examine the industry?  That is a fair question.  A question was asked on the value of loans in the buy-to-let market.  The figure is €24 billion.  Many buy-to-let loans are interest only and in arrears.  From my experience in banking in a fairly benign decade, the 1980s, this scenario would suggest that one would need to write off 25% of these loans.  One quarter of €24 billion is €6 billion, which is not the figure provided for in the PCAR.  If one adds in owner occupier mortgages, one can round up the figure by another €4 billion, giving a total of €10 billion.  This is much higher than the €6 billion figure provided for in the PCAR.  In that case, the PCAR is wrong by a margin of 66%.  The first PCAR was wrong in March 2010 when I was told I was an idiot for suggesting that AIB needed €10 billion and Bank of Ireland needed €3.5 billion immediately.  I was told in this room - I was an ordinary punter then - that I was mad.  I do not trust the second PCAR either, the reason being that the fellows from BlackRock Solutions, Boston Consulting and Barclays Capital - the three Bs - who came in here do not know the portfolios.  They know the numbers and run them through models by reference to Nevada but that has nothing to do with knowing the loans, borrowers, climate and potential for growth or contraction on the ground.  I am trying to be realistic rather than negative because I want the country to get out of the hole quickly.  It is a shame that on 31 July we stripped the National Pensions Reserve Fund of €10 billion, leaving €5 billion, and stuck this money into the banks when we should have told international creditors that we would capitalise the banks by means of a creditor write-down and keep the €10 billion for fiscal shock absorption.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Does the Deputy have any questions on the report?
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I am engaging with our visitors.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Does he have any specific questions on the report?
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Yes.  Should we align the report along the lines of the framework I suggested, providing contemporary dates and management information in banks that we can control?  The banks need a strong handle on them, in other words, an inspectorate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	88	To back up a little and consider the issue more generally, the Deputy referred to the different PCAR exercises.  Obviously the PCAR exercise is a form of stress testing.  Historically it was the case, not only in Ireland but also elsewhere, that regulatory authorities or central banks tended to generate macro-scenarios when carrying out stress tests.  They generated an adverse macro-scenario which may, for example, have featured a 4% or 5% fall in GDP and an increase in interest rates, unemployment etc.  These were then passed to the commercial banks who would come back with the results.  The various significant issues have been well documented with that type of approach.  From the experience I have had, for instance, I have attended a few of the European systemic risk boards and have seen the state of stress testing elsewhere and, given the difficulties we have had, it is part of the reason we are near enough to the forefront or the cutting edge of stress testing which may take some people by surprise but essentially the approach taken in the recent PCAR exercise is the bottom-up approach as the Deputy referred to it. Essentially it is to take the information from the institutions and to do the analysis in house in the Central Bank or in the regulatory authority.  That is the philosophical change which has occurred in stress testing.  Everybody now knows that is the way to go if one wants to convince markets in terms of the significance-----
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	89	That is what legal people who really understand their business do when they are doing provisioning.  They do not take models.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Okay.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	91	To put such an exercise in context, it is a massive undertaking, as one will appreciate, to take out loan level information on hundreds of thousands of loans, and that is just for the mortgage books.  There is obviously a huge amount of information in the other books as well.  The stress testing exercise did a very good job of taking all that information, putting the methodology in place and coming up with what it did.  Clearly, as we alluded to earlier when speaking about more regular data feeds, this goes to the point which is that the way in which these data are likely to be collected will be on a far more harmonised and far more frequent basis.  We will get information which will be pretty much harmonised in its definition across all the various institutions and we will also get it on a more frequent basis.  That will contribute enormously to the depth, integrity and robustness of the analysis which is conducted on it.  That is the way it is going to be, not just here but elsewhere.  We are ahead of it so I think in a way that addresses the issue.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I am fully behind Dr. Kieran McQuinn.  Tell them this is what you want.  Do not discuss it.  Say: "Do it this way."  It is a tragedy that the State now owns only 15% of it, having sold 35% to Wilbur Ross, Kennedy Wilson and a crowd of other vulture capitalists who are all-----
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	93	This is the broader-----
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	94	This is our regulator.  We do not meet him often.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	95	He is not the regulator.  He has referred the Deputy to the governor a couple of times.  We know that debate and I am not trying to diminish it.  It is a massive debate but it is not on our agenda today.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	96	And-----
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Sorry, Deputy.  Are there any other questions on this specific report?
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Why is it not being discussed?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Because we have had it on before and we will have it on again.  I can assure the Deputy of that and he will be central to that debate.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I just want the questions asked.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Today is not that day.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I would prefer to listen to others asking these questions.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	103	No.  We are interested in listening to the Deputy as well.  It is just that on our agenda today is this specific report.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I thank the Chairman and welcome our visitors from the Central Bank.  On the negative equity calculation I wonder if there is a need for another calculation.  I realise the researchers were here.  I take my cue from the last sentence which refers to the €91,000, although it is in a different category so it is not an overall comparison.  It is the concept I am looking for and I would welcome the views of our visitors on net negative equity.  If I have a house like the one in the example that lost €91,000, say, over a four-year period, I am not €91,000 worse off because if the rent on it was €2,000 per month - that is 48 weeks over the four years - my net position is better than if I had rented it.  There has been too much emphasis on how much it lost but the option is to either rent it or own it.  A sum of €91,000 was lost in this example but if it had been rented it would have cost €5,000 more.  A net figure put in there might get a more calm approach on the negative equity debate, or negative equity with rent adjustment.  It would be interesting to see for all those houses what it would have cost to have rented.  Many people who think they are badly off may not be, which might be a good thing in Ireland which is lacking in confidence.Do the ghost estates features in these numbers because we are seriously concerned about them?  In regard to the numbers given in the report, I endorse what Deputy Mathews and others said; they are very valuable.  We debated that issue the Seanad last night.  The conventional wisdom is that the Keane report is not the last word.  Therefore, I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, who took the debate, is aware of all the numbers in this research which should be available to him.  The budget is the next place for considering this issue.The buy-to-let sector features prominently.  In terms of public policy it is almost like people who bought the wrong lotto tickets.  All the worries people have around putting people out of houses do not occur if somebody already has a house and is paying that mortgage but this is something extra he or she took on.  I would be completely relaxed about the people who invested in buy-to-let that did not work out.  I do not think there is any need for anybody to get too excited about that.  It is an investment.  Some you win, some you do not.  FLAC and Threshold, which appeared before the committee, said that under our system of property rights, that could be a danger to the tenants as the repossessing bank can expel the tenants.  We asked them at the committee to check that issue and they maintain that is the situation.  That has a much different policy implication if the result for a professional person, in getting in to buy-to-let, is that when the bank repossesses that property, the tenants are the people who lose their property.  That seems a strange result.  As the witnesses are working in this field, I would refer that issue to them.As we try to look forward out of this crisis, there was never much concern in policy when we were all in positive equity and house prices increased by up to 20% per annum.  This was regarded as a great bonus and we were not willing to share it with anybody.  Since it has become negative equity, we are looking out for somebody to whom to pass on this burden.  When we get out of this crisis, would new kinds of mortgages be worth examining where that risk is shared between the financial institution and the person taking out the mortgage?  In the boom years, the person taking out the mortgage got massive tax-free capital gains, but I wonder whether different financial instruments might fare differently?  In the US one can give back the keys and that is the end of the transaction whereas in Ireland the debt follows one around forever so that one cannot get start again.What the new generation of economists are doing in the Central Bank is extremely valuable.  I hope they have a very important policy input for Ministers of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, Deputy Penrose, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  We are getting closer to clarifying the people who are in danger of losing houses and we should concentrate on those rather than on some of the larger numbers that have been touted around.  Focusing on the real extent of this problem is very important.  I thank the visitors for that.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	105	This report could be pivotal to getting results.  In recent weeks we have been trying to get figures to drill down to what exactly is happening in Ireland in regard to debt.  The witnesses are getting us close to that.  The Central Bank issued a press release some weeks ago on arrears.  The figures showed that 62,000 were more than 90 days in arrears and of that 62,000, almost 40,000 were more than 180 days in arrears.  If someone has not paid their mortgage for six months, outside of restructuring, one could say that is an unsustainable mortgage.  When we look at restructured mortgages, a significant percentage of those were paying either capitalisation, which means the bank had taken equity in the house, interest which was less than the interest being paid on the mortgage, and something else which I cannot remember off-hand.  Essentially they were paying back less than the interest on the loan.  A good picture was where somebody was able to pay interest alone.  That in itself is not sustainable over the long term.  When all these figures are taken together - the number of people who are in arrears for a certain period plus the ones who reorganised their mortgages but are still paying less on the interest - it is close to 10%.  Then there are the other people who have rearranged their mortgages but will fall into problems in the next 12 months.  With an overall market of around €120 billion, that is easily €10 billion worth of mortgages that are going pear-shaped.  I do not know what value is left in those mortgages.  Does Dr. McQuinn have an idea of the value that is left, say, in properties with huge mortgages?  Can we drill down to that level in the figures?  The Governor of the Central Bank says that €6 billion will be needed to recapitalise.  I am not an economist or an accountant, but my instincts tell me it is much more than that.The delegates gave us figures about buy-to-let properties.  I know this type of buy-to-let property: they are places in small country towns in the middle of nowhere where some fellow bought a big old building, did it up and turned it into ten apartments, borrowing heavily all the way.  They are essentially useless now.  One would be lucky to get the Department of Social Protection to take one or two of the apartments - that is about as far as it goes.  I would like more information on this kind of thing.  I know where Deputy Mathews is coming from, but what this committee really needs to know is how accurate the information is.  The information being provided to us by the banks is suspect, to say the least, and that is putting it mildly.  Some of the stuff we have been told over the past two years on this committee is absolute rubbish, to be honest.  We want a bit more than that.Do the delegates have a role in enforcing the implementation of the Central Bank's code of practice among the banks?  What recommendations would they have in that regard?  There seem to be some complaints about this; people feel the banks are using the code of practice to bully people, to some degree, whereas we feel it should be used to protect householders.  What came out of the discussions on the Keane report - I know Mr. McQuinn also sits on that committee - is the fact that it seems to be skewed more towards the institutions than towards the borrowers.  I ask Mr. McQuinn to give us his views on that, because we feel the borrowers are the ones who are cornered here and that what is happening is to the lenders' advantage.Based on the information the delegates have provided, buy-to-let mortgages seem to be an absolute disaster.  However, household mortgages are also in difficulty, and this is important because of the social effects on the people involved.  Are the delegates also considering other forms of household debt?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	106	No, not in the analysis we are presenting.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Is there anyone else in that milieu looking at it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	108	It is basically an information issue.  As part of future data gathering there will be better information on other aspects of consumer debt and other loans apart from mortgages.  However, it was not really the focus of the analysis that was done to date.  The PCAR exercise conducted earlier this year considered various asset classes but mainly focused intensely on the mortgage side of things.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The biggest problem remains affordability rather than negative equity, although there has been much discussion about the latter.  How did the Central Bank get involved with ghost estates?  I thought that was predominantly a NAMA issue.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	110	We had better bank questions, as it will be more efficient.  I ask Mr. McQuinn to take a note of the question and return to it.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	111	There is a great deal of stuff to which the Central Bank has access.  Interestingly, Mr. McQuinn mentioned that the majority of mortgage arrears were in the Border and midlands counties.  According to figures supplied to me by the Construction Industry Federation, houses in Dublin are now selling within five to six months, whereas in the Border and midlands area it takes up to 50 months.  If all the arrears and unsustainable mortgages are also in that area, we could have a problem.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Just to clarify, the rate of arrears is higher in those areas; that does not necessarily mean there are more houses in arrears.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	113	There are far fewer houses in those areas.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	114	That is true, but there could be problems if there are already many houses for sale and there is a high proportion of arrears among existing householders.  We will have to consider this because we may have to target solutions recommended by the Keane report at certain areas through legislation if there is a regional problem as well as the affordability issue.  I ask Mr. McQuinn to answer some of those questions, because his answers will decide the direction we should take.  I apologise to the Chairman as it is getting late, but this is a bunch of guys who I feel are really hitting home.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	115	We would all agree with that.  The material is exceptionally helpful.  Are there any other questions?
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I have one last question.  The delegates mentioned the Keane report.  By the way, I emphasise my thanks for their work and their contributions, which have been brilliant.  Take for instance-----
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	117	This should be a question about negative equity.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I have heard it said by somebody who appears in the media to be quite knowledgeable and authoritative that where there is negative equity, the banks cannot do a loan-for-equity swap.  That is absolute rubbish.  If we take, for example-----
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Deputy, you are asking a question and answering it.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I am asking these people to put the idea out there that there is such a thing as a debt-for-equity swap where there is negative equity.  I will give an example.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	121	No, Deputy, please.  It is 5.30 p.m.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	122	The initial cost is €600,000.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	123	No, Deputy.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	124	It is easy to see it.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Please, no.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	126	This is a solution.  They have proffered a solution.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Deputy, you are not-----
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I will speak to the delegates afterwards.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	129	That is a better way of doing it.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	130	It is my contention - I would like to know the opinion of the delegates on this - that there is too much emphasis on negative equity.  Should we move the debate much more towards affordability, as was alluded to by one of the previous speakers?
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	131	You could combine both.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I ask Mr. McQuinn to do the best he can, with the assistance of his colleagues, in answering that series of questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	133	In reply to the questions of Deputy Daly and Senator Barrett, the negative equity problem is serious and has received a huge amount of attention.  It is a serious issue in its own right.  For households who are in negative equity but may be well able to maintain their mortgage payments, there are issues in that they cannot sell their properties and so on.  One of the things we examined in this analysis is the intersection between negative equity and affordability, and that is one of the primary outcomes of the research.  That is why we made point 7 in our presentation - to give the information we have about the situation.  As mentioned earlier, an imminent publication will address this very point, dealing with households that are in negative equity and arrears, households that are just in negative equity and not in arrears, and households that are in arrears but not in negative equity.  Having that information should be quite useful in terms of finding ways to address the problem.Senator Barrett mentioned factoring in rental rates and so on.  That is an interesting point and puts the situation in some perspective.  On the issue of negative equity, the calculations were quite detailed and the analysis presented and generated quite a number of different house prices.  One of the issues at the moment is how representative different house prices are.  Using the information we have in the loan books, we can compile our own price indicators on a regional basis, which is useful because it enables us to get quite an accurate picture of negative equity.  Many of the estimates of negative equity use an aggregate price for the entire country across the different regions, which clearly is not fully representative.  Some of our negative equity estimates use regional house price data, which will be interesting in terms of getting a good estimate of the nature and extent of the issue.Speakers referred to ghost estates.  My understanding is that if properties have been moved off the balance sheets of the banks then it will not be in the data used but if they have not, then the ghost estates will be in there.  We are unable to identify the exact estates.  The most granular identifier we have is at county level and one cannot go much further or deeper than that.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	134	If an estate has gone to NAMA then it is nothing to do with the Central Bank and if it is not in NAMA then it will be on the balance sheets of the banks.  Is that correct?  Does the Central Bank describe these as buy-to-let, owner occupier or as commercial loans?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	135	It depends on the nature of the loan for those remaining.  If it is a residential property then it will be a residential loan on the books and if it was a buy-to-let then it will be a buy-to-let loan.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	136	It cannot be a residential loan if it is in a ghost estate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	137	We do not know whether a given loan represents a ghost estate.  It may be on the books but we cannot identify that it is a ghost estate loan.  The deepest level we can identify is county level.  We cannot go any further.  We cannot map it to an estate.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	138	It is not possible to physically see it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	139	We would need the physical address to which we have no access.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	140	How can there be a residential mortgage on a ghost estate?  The idea is that a ghost estate is empty.  Therefore, the loans will be either buy-to-let or commercial.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Yes.  If it is there, then it would be a commercial loan.  I am trying to explain that we do not know whether the loan in question represents a ghost estate.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	142	It could straddle both.  It could be in the NAMA portfolio or the bank portfolio because if it has been sold to a private buyer, it becomes a private loan and NAMA takes the residual.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I wish to respond to Senator Barrett's comments.  The buy-to-let situation is interesting.  The issue we raised and the points we made relate to the overlap.  There are people who have both types of loans, owner occupier and buy-to-let.  If something is done about buy-to-let then there may be a knock-on implication for those concerned.  This comes out of the data.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	144	What about the code of practice?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I am not from the economic side; I am from the regulatory side.  My area deals with the various codes of practice in place.  We have no wish to see the banks using the mortgage arrears code as a tool to put pressure on consumers.  It is there purely to protect the consumers and so that they understand the process and the framework.  We have teams of inspectors who are on the road monitoring compliance of the mortgage arrears code by banks.  This will take place in the coming months and once that work is done we will publish some outcomes on how it works.The mortgage arrears code is in place and relates only to the principal private dwelling or family home but we issued our new mortgage protection code last week which will become effective on 1 January next.  This will include and bring across some of the arrears provisions for other types of debt such as credit card debt, personal loans and buy-to-let mortgages.  Some protection has been put into the other code published last week.In the new code we have also included new rules on the affordability side and this may be of interest to the committee.  From 1 January onwards, when a mortgage is being sought by a consumer the bank must carry out a strict affordability test on the consumer and his or her repayment capacity and whether he or she can meet the repayments.  They must test for a stressed scenario as well.  We have instructed them to test for a 2% increase in interest rates and whether the consumer can bear the additional repayment cost.  If it turns out at the end of the assessment that the consumer cannot bear the repayment, the rules dictate that the bank cannot provide the product or that amount of a mortgage to the consumer and then the bank must reconsider and offer a different product or different term.  These rules will be in place from 1 January.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Are there any remaining questions?
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	147	We held a discussion with Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, on the Keane report at a previous meeting of the committee.  FLAC suggested that it might be useful to give the code of practice some legislative underpinning.  What is the delegation's view?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	148	It is under legislation; it is a statutory code and it is issued under the Central Bank Act 1989.  It is enforceable and it is under law.  The banks are required under law in this regard and we can sanction them for non-compliance.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	149	FLAC had some concerns about that.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	150	There is an issue with regard to mortgage protection policies.  I had a case last week in which a person had died.  They had let the mortgage premium protection lapse some 12 months before their death, which was sudden.  There should be a rule for any institution providing protection the interest of which is noted in a mortgage protection policy.  In the event of the premium falling into arrears, the institution should be bound by law to keep up the premium payments until the loan case is resolved.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	151	The mortgage arrears code is in place at the moment but we will be doing a full review of it next year.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	152	This case is a disaster, representing €400,000 of an exposed loan.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Let us have the final two interventions.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	154	Surely the Chairman means "contributions".
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	155	They are called "interventions" in Europe for some reason but you are right, they should be termed "contributions" or "questions".
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Can the data be produced by house price?  The inability of someone to afford a €100,000 house is a great deal more serious than, for example, my inability to live in Ailesbury Road.  If the data were available by house price or by the income of the person it would be of interest for policy purposes.  I am unsure whether the way the Central Bank has collected the data will allow it to respond to this.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I was here earlier and I missed the delegation's earlier contributions but I tried to watch them on the monitor.  I have one specific question but the knowledge may have been imparted earlier and, if it was, I apologise for asking the question again.  Does the Central Bank have a profile of residential home mortgages in difficulty rather than buy-to-let mortgages or those in arrears that are sup-prime, variable or fixed rate mortgages?
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	158	It would be helpful if it could be set down on a spreadsheet because then we could see the totals and the compositions and so on.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I believe the answer is in paragraph three on page 2.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I will read it out.  The balance of 50% of customers in 90 plus days in arrears are in the four banks included in the financial measures programme.  Some 40% are in other non sub-prime lending institutions and 10% are with sub-prime lenders, which account for less than 2% of the stock of outstanding mortgage debt.  The figures are similar when we examine it on the basis of the number of loans.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	161	It would be most helpful if we could see the number of billions under all of those headings on a spreadsheet
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Senator Barrett asked about house price by income.  We have the house price for each loan so we can examine the data in that way.  The income situation is interesting in the sense that in the case of residential mortgages we have the income level at the point of origination of the loan.  This is useful but in examining arrears the economic modellers among us are more interested in the income position of the households today rather than when they took out the loans.  This is something of an issue for us.  A variety of approaches have been taken to try to get around the problem.  In the case of most people who take out a mortgage with a financial institution, generally the financial institution is aware of the income level when the loan is taken out but not the income level for the duration of the loan.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	163	We may wish to submit questions to the Central Bank on the basis of the presentation.  Is it open to this suggestion?  Are there any restrictions to it?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Members should submit questions through the clerk.  Then the committee will write and we will impart the material to all members of the committee if it turns out that there is more material.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I envisage that there will be more and more material.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-26 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Deputy Twomey made a point earlier.  The availability of information is crucial to our deliberations and to the public debate.  This is an impressive report for its rigour and professionalism and it contains important information that will be of great use to us in our debates and for the public debate that must be had on all these issues.  I thank the Central Bank delegation for its presentation.  It has been excellent and most helpful to us and I thank it for its willingness to answer the questions.  I thank all the delegates who have come in and contributed to the session.I seek the agreement of the committee to place the written submission on the website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
