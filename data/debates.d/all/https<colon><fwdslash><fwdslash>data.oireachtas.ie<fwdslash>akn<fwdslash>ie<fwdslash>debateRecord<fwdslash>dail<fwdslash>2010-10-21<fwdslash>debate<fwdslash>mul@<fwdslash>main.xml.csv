#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of national importance and concern: the urgent need to ensure that all matters relating to the damaged homes in Marino following the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel are resolved in a fair and proper manner; that all senior citizens — I emphasise that these are senior citizens — whose homes were damaged are compensated quickly and fairly; that all of those involved in the negotiations respect the urgent needs of the local residents; and that the Minister for Transport and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government ensure all local residents in Marino are compensated.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of local and national importance, namely, the fine line between health cutbacks and the deliberate exposure of the population to inevitable fatalities, given the impossibility of providing a safe health service to a population of approximately 4.3 million using 30% of an already depleted budget, while a top-heavy and overmanned administrative staff remain untouched and take up 70% of available health funding.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It is proposed to take No. 4, Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Bill 2010 — Second Stage (resumed), to adjourn at 1.30 p.m. if not previously concluded; and No. 17 — statements on the Food Harvest 2020 report.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply with regard to No. 17: the statement of a Minister or Minister of State and the main spokespersons for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It is not agreed.  The Dáil is going away for the weekend, as is much of the rest of the country.  However, there is absolutely no reason the Dáil should not return at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday and have a normal day's business.  At a time when the way out of our current economic difficulties is to work harder and provide better value, the onus is on the Dáil and the Government to ensure we take the lead in this regard by returning at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday.  I am aware that the arrangements with regard to next week's business are such that there will be few votes.  I ask the Government to reconsider the example we are giving by not returning at lunchtime on Tuesday.  Most people returning to work on Tuesday will be returning at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock in the morning.

We have made the case repeatedly, not only last week but again this week, for the Minister for Health and Children, whom I have yet to see in the Chamber this week, to come to the House to address the serious issues with our health services.  I will highlight only two of these: the debacle of the relocation of the National Children's Hospital, and the Minister's announcement on Tuesday morning——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Deputy, we are on the Order of Business.  We are not having a discussion on matters outside that.

In order to get through to the craniums of those who have closed their minds to the arguments against the unrealistic deadline of achieving a 3% budget deficit by 2014——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I requested an opportunity for the House to discuss our economic circumstances next week.  Following last night's meeting, there was clarity on objectives and targets, as well as agreement from the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party on those targets and dates.  The main Opposition parties have given a strong signal of clarity that they agree with the Government targets.  It is now time to get real.I understand there is a Cabinet meeting on Monday that may well run into Tuesday.  I expect that the Government will be serious about this economic debate and that we will talk about the real issues that now face our country and our people, and about the fact that our sovereign independence is at risk.  The Government will have to see to it that money is borrowed in January, and that cannot happen in the current circumstances.  It requires serious analysis and serious decisions to be made here.I asked our own Whip to agree with the Government that the decks be cleared of all business on Wednesday, except Leaders' Questions, and that the debate on Wednesday and Thursday be strictly related to the economy.  I hope that the Government will come into that debate and outline for us its view of the overall adjustment that must be made over the next number of years, give an assessment of its growth projections, as well as the fiscal adjustment it expects to make in 2011 in the budget on 7 December.This country is now in a position it has never been in before.  I am not going to say——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	23	We cannot have a debate on the economy during the Order of Business.

We have given up our Private Members' time so that all Members can make a contribution on what is a defining moment for this country in Irish politics.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I agree with the leader of the main Opposition party.  We agreed to clear the decks and I believe the Whips will be meeting later this afternoon to finalise arrangements for the debate next week.  The Government will be meeting on Monday and Tuesday, and it is because of this that we wish to return on Wednesday morning.  It is a very serious issue.  It is clearly our intention to discuss our four year budget and growth plan, and in case people think this has not been happening for some time, let us not forget that there has already been an adjustment of almost €14.5 billion over the last two years.  It is on that basis that the Government wishes to have further time for the consideration of the development and completion of the plan, and so proposes to sit on Wednesday and Thursday.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	27	In the course of next week's debate, will the Government be in a position to state clearly for the House its overall adjustment figures for the coming years?  Will the Government present to the Dáil for purposes of the debate its best assessment of the projected growth pattern for the coming years?  Will the Government indicate at the start of the debate the level of fiscal adjustment to which it is working for the budget in December?  In the past two days I have made the point that we need independent verification of the figures upon which parties are expected to prepare their plans.  The Minister for Finance may not agree with me on this, but there is now clearly a technical difference between the ESRI projections and the Government's projections produced by the Department of Finance.  Obviously the figure reached between the Commission and the Department of Finance is one thing, but it seems——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I know Deputy Kenny does not want to anticipate the debate.

The ESRI's figure for adjustment for next year is €4 billion to reach a 10% level.  The figure being operated by the Department of Finance is obviously much higher and I am not at liberty to say that.

In his contribution to "Morning Ireland" yesterday he tried to turn the issue by pointing to Fine Gael attacking public servants for their production of figures.  The Department of Finance is run by the Deputy, as Minister for Finance, and it is on his direction that figures are produced.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I am sure the Deputy will make those points next week——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I am asking the Government that if it is going——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	84	——and that is the time to make them, not now.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Tánaiste just said the Government is meeting on Monday and Tuesday——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Could I have the Deputy's co-operation, please?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	87	——to set out its figures.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Could I have the Deputy's co-operation on this matter?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Yes.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I have advised the Deputy that arrangements are being put in place to have the debate next week but the Deputy is endeavouring to kick-start it this morning.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	91	No.  The Tánaiste said the Government is meeting on Monday and Tuesday to finalise the figures.  I am asking if, in the course of the debate, the Government can confirm now that either before or during the debate it will give us its indicative figures.Second, can I ask the Tánaiste if before the debate commences the Minister for Finance, who is present, will publicly indicate whether the senior debt in Anglo Irish Bank has been redeemed in full or rolled over under the extended——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	92	All those questions can be raised during the debate.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	93	No, these are important ground rules.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	94	We are talking in the context of an arrangement being put in place for a full scale debate on the economy.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Will the Government make an arrangement——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	96	——and the Deputy is getting into the technical aspects of it this morning.  The Deputy is out of order on the Order of Business.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	97	——then for the Opposition——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The Deputy is simply out of order.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	99	——finance spokespeople to meet the Minister for Finance before the debate so that we can get this information supplied to us?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Remember that consensus is about sharing information so that we can make reasonable decisions.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I am very sure the Deputy will ask those questions and make those points during the debate next week.  If the Deputy was being deprived of the opportunity to do so, that would be a different matter——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	103	The Government and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, wanted consensus.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	104	——but this opportunity is being provided for the Deputy.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Consensus is about the sharing of reliable information.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	106	That is basic information.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Can I ask the Tánaiste a third question about next week?  At the end of the debate will the Government agree to take questions for a period of an hour or two in order to refine and give the Opposition and the citizens of this country knowledge about the plan with which the Government is going to Brussels the week afterwards?  That is just simple information not particularly for the Parliament but for the citizens of our country.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The Deputy has made her point.  Can I move on?  I call an Teachta Ó Caoláin.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I have a second issue that I want to raise.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	110	In relation to the same matter?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	111	It is a much happier issue.  The weekend after next is Hallowe'en.  No. 36 on the Government's legislative programme is the sale of alcohol Bill.  There are two issues in this respect.  The first one relates to home deliveries.  The Minister has promised to include in that legislation restrictions on home deliveries to under age drinkers.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Is there promised legislation on this matter?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	113	There is no mechanism in place in that respect.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Deputy, let us not develop Second Stage standard debate at this point on the issue.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	115	The second issue is that the Minister for Justice and Law Reform——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Deputy Burton, could I have co-operation, please?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	117	——has promised for ten years that there would be identification of who sells alcohol and information on where the alcohol originates on bottle labels.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Fine, Deputy.  Will you resume your seat please?  I call an Teachta Ó Caoláin.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Will the Tánaiste tell us when this legislation will come before the House?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I call an Teachta Ó Caoláin.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	122	On a point of order, the Ceann Comhairle has called the next speaker before the Tánaiste has responded.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	123	The Tánaiste will respond to the query on the legislation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I will be more than happy to respond.  The sale of alcohol legislation will be ready early next year.On the debate next week, there will be further discussions with the Whips on the way in which this debate will be managed and on the Order of Business preparation for next week.  It is appropriate to reiterate that the Government will be meeting on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister for Finance will be in Europe at the beginning of the week and he will apprise the Government and bring forward its perspective at the debate.  We are working out a four-year plan on budget and growth.  The Department of Finance has provided its assessment——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Its assessment but we want the Government's.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	126	We have listened to an awful lot of questions today from Deputy Burton and I certainly look forward during the course of the debate to hearing some answers from her.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Will the Tánaiste provide us with the Government's figures?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Deputy Burton, please, I call an Teachta Ó Caoláin.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Is the Tánaiste going to answer my other questions?  She did not address them.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Deputy Burton, please.  I call an Teachta Ó Caoláin.

Coming in with closed minds to the alternative arguments being presented by other voices certainly will not aid and abet the objective of getting the right answers.  The Minister's whole disposition this morning——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The Deputy will be well able to make those points next week——

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	134	——and he will have ample opportunity to do so.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I remember speaking on Second Stage of the Student Support Bill a few years ago, but it seems no progress has been made on the Bill since then.  I am sure many Deputies have had people call to their clinics who have not yet been paid their grants.  There is a huge backlog of grant applications and the various authorities are stretched in terms of their ability to process them.  Has the Tánaiste any plan to bring forward this legislation, as it was supposed to reform the position?
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	137	On the same matter——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Yes, Deputy, briefly.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The entire matter has been made very much worse by the announcements on the amalgamation of VECs and also by the changes in staff in local authorities.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	140	The Deputy cannot develop that debate now.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I am not developing a debate.  I am making the point that circumstances have changed because those officials in the local authorities who dealt with student grants are no longer dealing with them because of cuts.  It is important the Student Support Bill is brought back to the House to relieve the hardship experienced by students.  Deputy Tuffy is quite right to raise the matter.  It is a matter Labour Party Deputies have been raising for months.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Deputy Higgins can make those points when the Bill comes back to the House.  When is the legislation promised?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I am finalising work on the Student Support Bill and will bring it to Committee Stage this session.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	144	When the Croke Park deal was agreed, it was accepted each lead Department would produce a specific plan on reform and efficiencies.  When questioned on this last week in the House, the Tánaiste said those plans would not be published, despite the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, telling the Seanad they would.  Will the Tánaiste clarify for the House if these plans will now be published?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	145	This is not a matter for the Order of Business.  The Deputy can raise it next week during the debate on the economy.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	146	The problem, Sir, is the Tánaiste already addressed the matter last week.  I am looking for clarification on it.  I do not normally waste the Ceann Comhairle's time on the Order of Business.  Will he give me some latitude?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The Deputy will have ample opportunity next week.  He can talk to his party's Whip and get a speaking slot.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Okay, we will try this another way.  On a point of order, it is normal practice when a Member, directly or inadvertently, misleads the House that he or she is given an opportunity to correct the record of the House at the next available opportunity.  The Tánaiste said last Thursday that the plans by each Department would not be published.  Will she change this position in light of the comments made by her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, in the Seanad?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	149	That is a fair point.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	150	It is an excellent point.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	151	We are working through the process.  The implementation plans have been finalised by the relevant Departments and offices.  These must be reviewed by the implementation body in the next several weeks.  Only after this ongoing process has been completed will any documentation be made available.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	152	The Tánaiste told the House——

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The Tánaiste told the House last week the plans would not be published.  Is she now telling the House they will?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	159	There is a precedent here.  If the Ceann Comhairle allowed this matter to be raised last Thursday, why can I not raise it now?  Seven days have elapsed.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	160	Deputy, we are on the Order of Business.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I am sure the Tánaiste would like to reply.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The Order of Business does not provide for another Question Time.  The Deputy will have to find another way to raise this matter such as through a parliamentary question or an Adjournment matter.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	163	Why did the Ceann Comhairle allow the same question last Thursday?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The Tánaiste has changed her position in seven days.

In view of this morning's announcement of 107 job losses at Shannon Aerospace and the potential for more job losses at an adjoining company, what action has the Government taken to implement the recommendations of the mid-west task force report?  Were there early warning signs of these job losses?  What action has been taken to sustain and assist these companies in the Shannon region?

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I put this matter down for the Adjournment yesterday but the Ceann Comhairle refused it.

More than a year ago, legislation was promised to provide for people in mortgage arrears.  Up to 37,000 families are in serious arrears with their mortgage repayments with many of them before the courts.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	204	The Deputy can raise this next week on the debate on the economy.  He can put his name down early for his slot.

The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance promised the House legislation in this area during the debate on NAMA.  The only offer so far to assist those with mortgage arrears has been from the Department of Social Protection through mortgage interest relief.  The problem is greater than that.  It relates to compound interest applicable to all mortgage arrear cases which has not changed.  When will legislation to deal with this matter be introduced?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	206	An expert group on this matter has been set up which will report to the Minister for Finance at the end of October.  Whether legislation will be required then is a matter for the Minister for Finance.

I would regard this legislation as urgently required to improve and enhance our standing in international markets at this sensitive time.  When will it be introduced in the House?
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	208	That is an excellent question.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	213	Up to €7 billion of senior bondholders' debt was due to be redeemed in September 2010.

This slipped under the wire.  Will the Tánaiste inform us whether these moneys have been paid?  If so, was it by the Central Bank or the European Central Bank?  Who is carrying the can for this?

The Minister for Health and Children is out in the ether making statements about €1 billion in cuts in the health budget.  Will she make a statement to the House as to where these cuts are to be made and when?  We are entitled, on behalf of the people, to be informed about this.

We understood that the intent of the Bill was to give people a five year extension on planning permissions where they had not yet carried out the building work.  Now, however——

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	240	A few days ago one of my constituents told me she lost her medical card due to her income situation.  She is now getting her medication in Northern Ireland at one third of the price in the Republic.  When will the reference pricing for drugs be introduced?  I understand that at least €200 million could be saved in this area, which might be useful for some of the issues raised by Deputy Reilly.Second, in light of the fact that people in rural areas are having great difficulty accessing accommodation in the centres of excellence to have their cancer operations carried out, when will the eligibility for health services Bill be introduced so we can discuss what is really happening at these centres?  It is not the case that things are excellent and working out perfectly.

Second, what is the timescale for the publication of the Bill to transfer the functions of FÁS to the Department of Social Protection?  Third, there appears to be a major problem with the production of legislation.  There is little legislation before the House this week and there was very little last week, although a raft of legislation has been promised.  Is there a difficulty in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel or why does the Government appear to be incapable of producing promised legislation?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I understand the question on corporate donations was answered during the week.

This morning in Burnfoot, County Donegal, 11 customs officers — that is an anecdotal figure — were stopping cars at checkpoints, as they have been doing for the last couple of mornings.  They are carrying out their business but obviously interfering with business and law abiding citizens.  One gentleman was stopped this morning and fined €400 on the spot.  They brought him to a cash machine but he did not have €400 in the account.  His 18 month old child was with him in the car and he had to wait until his parents arrived.

That Bill will implement the protocols of the 1957 Convention on Extradition.

It has been sought for some time by my party in particular.  The Bill addresses two important matters of public concern, a concern that has been expressed in the media by a number of commentators not only in this jurisdiction, but also in the United Kingdom.  Those concerns are the perceived injustice of occupiers being sued by burglars and the extent of force an occupier can use to defend their property.  They are the core issues in the Bill.  It has come about because of this perceived injustice.  Following each high profile case, there was a response in the House to bring forward appropriate legislation to clarify the law in this regard.The most celebrated case was that of Tony Martin in England.  A burglar attempted to sue him having been injured on his property and this generated significant media comment in both the UK and Ireland.  Tony Martin shot dead a 16-year old burglar and wounded his accomplice, who subsequently attempted to sue for the injuries sustained.  He was convicted of manslaughter, though the bid to sue him was rejected in court.  This high profile case challenged the Government and the Opposition.Apart from the civil liability issue, considerable legal debate has taken place in recent years about whether, and to what extent, members of the public could resort to force to protect their property from trespassers.  The issue came to public prominence in Ireland in 2006 whenPádraig Nally was convicted of the manslaughter of a man he suspected was attempting to rob his farm.  The conviction was subsequently quashed and he was found not guilty following a retrial.  Both these high profile cases put pressure on the Legislature to act and this legislation is the final part of the reaction, which I welcome.Fine Gael made two attempts to introduce legislation in the Dáil, which would have helped to clarify this grey area but, like most Private Members' Bills, it was rejected.  The Progressive Democrats Party in an attempt to compete with us on law and order issues introduced a Bill, which was unusual for a Government party, but this happened because of the Fine Gael Bill at the time.  Our Bill provided for a presumption that force used against a trespasser would be reasonable unless the trespasser could prove otherwise and that an occupier would be exempt from civil liability for any harm caused to a trespasser.  It similarly removed the obligation to retreat.  Generally, the objectives of the Bill are contained in this legislation.  Fine Gael introduced the Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill in 2009, which was almost identical to the 2006 Bill.  It differed by providing for reduced immunity for occupiers who overreact in order that unreasonable force would still generate civil liability.  The Bill was defeated on Second Stage.Under this legislation, "curtilage" refers to the immediate area surrounding a house or adjacent to a dwelling and is used in conjunction with the dwelling.  Where people have extensive gardens around their houses, the definition of "curtilage" may have to be reinterpreted in the future.  It needs to be clearly defined because people have vast gardens which are very much part of the house.  Perhaps the Minister will refer to this issue when he replies.  Where a householder considers that a person has entered a dwelling or his curtilage for the purpose of carrying out an offence, he or she may use force against the intruder in the following circumstances: to protect himself or herself or any other person from injury, including death or imprisonment; to protect his or her property or the property of another from theft or damage; to prevent a crime; or to assist in making a lawful arrest.  These are plausible scenarios.In deciding whether the householder is justified in using force, a two-pronged test comprising subjective and objective elements is provided for. The subjective test means that the householder must believe that the intruder entered for the purpose of committing a criminal offence.  He or she must also believe that the force used was reasonable in the circumstances, as he or she sees them.  In this respect, it does not matter whether the use of force can be justified or not if the person honestly believes that it was reasonable in the circumstances.  With regard to the objective test, in deciding whether the person honestly believed that the force used was reasonable, a jury should consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for the belief and all other relevant circumstances.  For example, if a householder claims that he or she honestly believed there was a need to stab someone to prevent a personal injury or damage to property, a jury would be directed to examine circumstances such as the behaviour of the intruder, whether he or she was carrying a weapon, the exact circumstances of the stabbing, what was said, where it took place, etc.These are the principal ingredients of the Bill and it has generally been welcomed.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, sent us an interesting overview of the Bill and it is generally in favour of it.  The council's officials have asked for an amendment about which the Minister will be aware.  Perhaps he will address their concerns in his reply.  They have also made a good suggestion, that because of the extensive media coverage the Bill has attracted, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the office of the Minister should draw up simple guidance for members of the public when the Bill has completed its passage through the Oireachtas and has been enacted.  Such clarity could reassure people of their legal rights in defending their homes without erroneously encouraging them to believe that the Legislature has granted them a licence to take more extreme action.  I do not believe in using the term "licence to kill" because that is not the intention of this Bill.  I hope there will be a great deal of public education when the Bill is enacted to clarify what people are entitled to do.The Bill has also been welcomed by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors because it gives clarity to the entitlement of the homeowner to defend his home against uninvited intruders.  The vice-president said, "The Bill has shifted the balance of rights back to the homeowner where it should always have been".  He also described as "ridiculous" suggestions that the Bill equates to a licence to kill and contended that home owners will continue to act in a sensible and peaceful way, with which I totally agree.  Irish Rural Link made a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights during my tenure as a member of the committee and its representatives were clear about their support for the legislation.Apart from the questions posed by the ICCL, this Bill has been universally accepted.  Yesterday evening I mentioned that I took part in a debate on Radio Kerry some years ago with Deputy Ferris when Fine Gael proposed its Bill.  He was very much opposed to it then but listening to him last night, I do not know now.  I welcome the fact that he seems to be supportive of it now.  There is unanimity on the Bill within this House as far as I can see.There is a bigger issue with regard to the security of homes.  We must all take more responsibility for security in our homes.  We should not encourage people in any way to invade our homes or trespass on our property through our own negligence.  People should be very conscious of closing windows when they leave and ensuring doors are locked.  Some people do not do this and it is amazing the number of people, especially in the countryside, who leave doors unlocked.People should have a gate leading onto their property which should be secured at all times.  Perhaps they should also have signs to the effect that trespassers or uninvited guests are not welcome.  We do not want to create a siege mentality but people can take certain precautions and should be vigilant at all times when it comes to their buildings, houses and where they live.  Also, where possible, the use of cameras and an alarm system can be a deterrent.  Not everyone can afford a camera or alarm system but generally speaking they come cheap enough and if people can afford it, they should install one.  When a potential trespasser or burglar sees that a house is fitted with an alarm system, straight away it is a deterrent for them.  Alarm systems should be encouraged as much as possible.I welcome the Bill.  Fine Gael made two serious efforts to introduce a similar Bill.  This was heavily criticised at the time, especially by Vincent Browne.  He had a right go at Fine Gael over the first Bill in 2006 and I wonder what he is saying about this Bill now.  Last night, I complimented the Minister on bringing forward the Bill and I recognise that he has brought forward a raft of legislation.  He has been in the House more often than any other Minister and has brought forward some very good reforming legislation during his term of office.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I wish to share my time with Deputy Sargent with ten minutes each.  On the basis of the principle that one's home is one's castle, the Bill is especially welcome.  The reason the new Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Bill 2010 has been introduced is to tip the balance in favour of law abiding home dwellers.  In clarifying the law in this area, the Bill sets out to state clearly that a person can use all reasonable force in defending his or her home.  It provides that home dwellers do not have to retreat in the face of intruders.  In particular, it puts an end to the bizarre situation and unjust practice that went on whereby burglars can sue for damages if they are injured while carrying out a robbery.  That was a ridiculous situation and it has been put right in this legislation.I join other speakers in complimenting the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on this reforming legislation.  As Deputy Jimmy Deenihan stated, he has been responsible for several tranches of reforming legislation which tilt the balance against the criminal and it is high time this was done.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 are three examples of new legislation to tackle gangland crime and criminals roaming at will, breaking into people's houses and so on, and this Bill will be of significance in that respect.Mention has been made of Pádraig Nally.  That case was a cause of concern to people throughout the country.  The Bill will clearly state that people attacked in their homes and people who are robbed and intimidated now have an additional protection, that is, the ability to protect themselves.  My one concern relates to the question of the curtilage of a dwelling house and why it is not more clearly defined.  This issue has been raised and it is essential that the curtilage of a dwelling house should include the area within the boundary walls of the house.  I realise this issue has been examined by the Minister and the Attorney General.  I urge the inclusion of an amendment in respect of the curtilage of a house such that the boundary walls of the house or the site on which the house is located, whether in an urban or rural area, should be included in the curtilage.The question of mandatory sentencing is being examined.  The Attorney General has asked the Law Reform Commission to examine the matter, which is worthwhile.  I believe there should be mandatory sentencing for people who commit burglaries or break into people's homes.  While the legislation that exists has been strengthened, I welcome the fact that legislation introduced in recent times recognises that people have the right to feel safe in their own homes.This legislation is sending a strong message to intruders by imposing substantial sentences.  For example, burglaries in people's private homes carry a maximum sentence of 14 years and aggravated burglaries carry a sentence of life imprisonment.  It is essential that there should be strong deterrents, especially for burglary and aggravated burglary of people's homes and private dwelling houses.  I would go so far as to say if it is necessary to have mandatory sentencing in that situation, then that should be the case.I point to the situation which exists with regard to the level of crime carried out while people are on bail.  I have made a suggestion within our party structures to the Minister for Justice and Law Reform with regard to serial burglars who have been in prison before and who are on bail as a result of continuing gangland activity and breaking into houses, creating burglaries and so on.  It is time for electronic tagging of those serial criminals while they are on bail awaiting a further trial.  The Garda will have the statistics on this but it is clear that many burglaries are committed by the same people again and again.  The experience in Galway is that the same people and gangs continually cause trouble in terms of burglaries, etc.I compliment the Garda in Galway on the significant level of detection rates, which act as a great deterrent for criminals.  I take this opportunity to welcome the initiatives taken in Galway.  For example, there are two regional response units in the western region, comprising two elite units of highly skilled gardaí, which provide invaluable support to policing in the community.  The two 12-member units based in Salthill, Galway and Claremorris, County Mayo, perform regular duties such as patrolling streets and county towns in Galway but can switch to armed mode in a critical situation.  This is the type of policing support that ordinary gardaí need to deal with criminal gangs which roam the country continually looking for the opportunity to carry out crime.I refer to the front line policing evident in Galway now.  It is making our neighbourhoods safe.  We have excellent success in the detection and apprehension of criminals but no matter what one does, the Garda Síochána cannot hope to stop all crime.  Crime prevention and community support initiatives throughout the country are vitally important.  Neighbourhood watch is a crime prevention programme that enlists the active co-operation of the community in neighbourhoods by observing suspicious activities and reporting them to the Garda Síochána.  We must persuade more people to get involved in neighbourhood watch and encourage people to be very vigilant, especially in areas where there is a tradition of criminal activity.  In some areas east of Galway city, such as Carnmore, Claregalway and Turloughmore, there are spates of burglaries from time to time.The Garda Síochána needs support from local communities and for them to be vigilant about activities and suspicions.  It is sad that in the period when I was trying to bring about more investment, assistance and support to the Traveller community as Minister of State with responsibility for justice, equality and law reform, the number of convictions of members of the Traveller community and the number of people from the Traveller community in jail because of burglary and larceny was abnormally high.  Along with various Departments, agencies and representative organisations of the Traveller community, we must try to stop this kind of activity by a small minority of the Traveller community.  They bring their community into disrepute and cause trouble for the vast majority of those in the Traveller community across this country, who are law-abiding citizens and live a good life.  I urge people from all walks of life to try to address this issue to prevent this scourge among that sector of the community.  I am not singling them out but the statistics are clear.  We must try to educate people from the Traveller community and prevent that activity, which is bringing them into disrepute.There should be no tolerance of people breaking into the private houses of others.  I urge the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to put in place whatever resources and legislative backup is required to ensure a person's home is his castle.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	278	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Fahey as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille seo, the Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Bill.  I welcome that it provides a definition of the dwelling and when justifiable force may be used against a person entering for criminal purposes.  It also states clearly that the occupier has no obligation to retreat from the dwelling.  In addition, it bars the taking of civil actions against occupiers who protect dwellings and inflict injuries incidental to that.  The Bill is not a panacea for the problems and fears that are day-to-day preoccupations for people in our country but it clarifies the law on self-defence.  To that extent, it can serve to reduce the trauma for someone who has been burgled.  The injustice we saw in the past, where an occupier is sued by a burglar, is hopefully at an end.  I hope the Bill achieves that objective.  Time will tell.The Bill is also a response to the precedent set down by the courts.  We must have due regard to that, whether the case of Tony Martin, where a wounded burglar attempted to sue the occupier, or the Pádraig Nally case, where Mr. Nally was found not guilty on retrial, notwithstanding the trauma and loss of life that was part of the case.  Hopefully, we can learn from the decisions of the court and take on board the accumulated wisdom from having examined the cases in detail over a protracted period of time, notwithstanding the trauma on all sides over the course of the trials.One of my main reasons for speaking on this Bill is that many of us have personal experience of the circumstances referred to and considered by this legislation.  In the early 1990s, a good friend of mine, whom I miss very much, Reverend Stephen Hilliard, rector of Rathdrum, County Wicklow, was killed by a burglar.  I am not sure this legislation would have been a solution and that is why I say it is not a panacea.  On hearing a noise downstairs, Reverend Hilliard went to investigate and as a result he was confronted by the burglar holding a kitchen knife from the premises.  He was stabbed and bled to death.  Fear uasal a bhí ann.  Bhí sé mar shagart de chuid Eaglais na hÉireann.  Bhí sé de nós agam buaileadh leis in Ardteampall Chríost.  Is uafásach an tragóid é dá bhean chéile agus dá mhuintir gur cailleadh é mar sin.  Ní leigheas é an Bille seo ar an eachtra nó tragóid sin — in ainneoin pé reachtaíocht atá in áit, ní féidir duine mar sin a thabhairt thar n-ais.  Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann.  Duine séimh uasal a bhí ann.Many references have been made to people in rural Ireland.  There are many rural dwellers in my constituency of Dublin North, some of whom are very much on the breadline and some of whom are not.  In the farming section of Irish Examiner today, we must take account of the fact that there may be fewer burglaries not because there are fewer burglars, but because rural dwellers are on the breadline.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has carried out research which shows that the weekly costs for rural households are between €69.91 and €108.61 higher than urban households, mainly due to higher transport and food costs.  In contrast, child care and social life are less expensive.  I am not sure what criteria were used to measure this.  It also points to the fact that rural dwellers are not as rich pickings as may have been thought by burglars in the past.  Hopefully this will be a disincentive for those who make a living breaking the law.Go bunúsach, mar a dúirt mé, ní leigheas é an Bille seo, ach is soiléiriú é ar an amhras agus an easpa misnigh atá ag daoine a bhí buailte ag robálaithe agus a leithéid.The only way to reassure people that they will not be burgled is to advise them to adopt every precautionary principle that is possible.  From talking to the Garda it appears that most burglaries are as a result of some level of carelessness, for example, a window left open or a door left ajar.  This is too serious a matter on which to beat around the bush.  It is essential that people take precautions not to put temptation in the way of intruders.  That is not to ascribe liability to anyone who is burgled but burglars are looking for the easy option and if they see an opportunity they will take it.  I accept that not everyone is able to afford a burglar alarm but it needs to be on the shopping list of choices people have.  If one can afford an alarm, it is a good investment that brings reassurance and peace of mind and it is a signal to burglars that they are not going to have life made easy for them in any way.Tá seanfhocal ann, "ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine".  Is ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine ó thaobh eachtraí mídhleathacha ar nós robálacha chomh maith.  Ba cheart a rá le daoine gur fiú bheith ag caint leis na comharsan béal dorais agus bheith páirteach in Neighbourhood Watch agus i ngrúpaí ar nós, i mo cheantar féin, Balbriggan Awareness of Drugs.  That organisation invites representatives of every housing estate to meet with the Garda to address issues relating to drug addiction, including legal drugs such as alcohol.  Such groups help in particular to build community spirit and a sense of alertness that helps to thwart burglars.  The Garda Síochána has a significant role to play, and has done much in terms of prevention to thwart burglars.  Since the northern end of north County Dublin became part of the Dublin metropolitan policing area there has been a noticeable improvement in the number of gardaí on the beat.  The increased Garda presence has helped communities to feel safer.  People are aware that the Garda are available to help when needed.I hope all of those points will be taken on board.  Equally, I hope the criticism by the Law Reform Commission that is referred to in the research document from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service can be taken on board.  I have spoken to the Minister about the matter.  His view is that the criticisms have been taken on board.  Perhaps he will refer to that when he sums up and put at rest the minds of those in the Law Reform Commission who may think otherwise.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	279	Tá áthas orm seans a bheith agam labhairt ar an Bhille seo, Bille um an Dlí Coiriúil (Cosaint agus Teaghais) 2010.  The Bill in its provisions contains an acknowledgement that the home should be a place of safety and the application of self-defence in the context of an attack in the home may be different from a situation which obtains in other circumstances.  The Bill is a short one which purports to clarify the law in the event of a householder being confronted in the home by a person intent on committing a criminal act.The reason the Bill is before the House is due to some terrible incidents which have taken place, mainly in rural areas.  There was also an incident in the heart of Waterford city which caused a great deal of concern locally.  The most important question as far as I am concerned is whether the legislation will prove to be a deterrent; in other words, will the people who carry out break-ins think twice before they embark on the terrible violence, sometimes fatal, that can be delivered in the course of burglaries?  I have some concerns in that regard and also in terms of householders.  How many elderly or vulnerable people who live in isolated areas, for example, women living alone, would be able to defend themselves in the event of being attacked in their homes?  I ask the Minister to address that issue because while it sounds fine in theory to talk about self defence it is questionable whether such people would have the wherewithal to defend themselves against aggressive or armed intruders.  That issue needs to be addressed.Individuals were apprehended recently in my constituency in connection with burglaries and break-ins.  They had come to the area from a long way off.  Their activity was of an organised nature.  On the one hand we have random break-ins but we also have organised break-ins.  In urban areas people who are fuelling a drug habit break in to houses in a random fashion wherever they find a weakness.Deputy Sargent referred to windows being left open.  He also referred to the Neighbourhood Watch scheme.  We must encourage communities to safeguard vulnerable people in their area in so far as that is possible.  Many of the organised burglaries can be intelligence-led.  People circulate in an area with the intention of identifying vulnerable targets for a break-in.  The Garda does much good work in that regard.  It is a significant issue.  I am aware of the problem in my county where there are isolated areas.  The Garda has done well in terms of apprehending people but it is difficult to undertake the type of dispersed surveillance that is required.The issue arises of whether the legislation will improve the situation to any great extent.  As a community we must do something substantial.  As Deputies we have all encountered people who live in great fear, not alone in rural areas but in urban areas as well.  We are familiar with the cliché that a person's home is his castle.  When there are reports in the media of break-ins and violence anywhere in the country it raises the fear level in communities.  When I was growing up in Waterford city I remember that people left their keys in the door so that if family members or friends came to visit they could open the door and come in.People do not do that any longer.  The country is not as pleasant a place to live in as it was when I grew up; things have changed and we are in a new era.  This Bill seeks to address in a substantial way issues faced by people whose homes are violated, broken into and who are confronted by an intruder.  I am not convinced, however, that it will improve the situation.The interpretation section deals with the definition of the home, with dwelling defined widely to include vehicles or vessels constructed or adapted for use as a vehicle and seems to be comprehensive.  The provisions of the Bill would stretch as far as someone living in a tent or a caravan who is attacked.  Curtilage is also taken into consideration, along with the dwelling.We then come to the attempt to define justifiable force, an issue where clarity is needed, particularly in regard to the wholly subjective test as to occupier's belief, which will potentially allow the infliction of deadly force on the basis of paranoia, fear or anxiety rather than objective concerns over physical threats to the individual rather than just to property.  If someone is under attack he will be suffering anxiety and fear and the subjective assessment of the situation before using force is difficult.  I ask that the concerns outlined in the Library and Research Service digest would be addressed by the Minister.  There are issues about the DPP v. Barnes case, that outlined that a person cannot lawfully lose his life simply because he trespasses on the dwelling of another with intent to steal.  In what way does this legislation change that position?There are points in the Bill that need to be clarified.  The Opposition would favour measures that will protect people in their homes while giving them peace of mind.  Does, however, the Bill change the current situation in any substantial way?  I am not convinced it does.  I will wait for the Minister's reply to hear the thinking of the Government on these issues.  The most important question is if the legislation improves the situation for people who suffer terribly and whom all sides of the House wish to protect.  We all want to stop this sort of crime and the fear that it causes, in both rural and urban areas.Should someone retreat when his house is invaded if he has that option?  No one should be held to be obliged to retreat but the courts have pointed out that in many situations the householder would be advised to flee but would never be under a legal obligation to do so.  Any legislation that improves the situation for those who are exposed to break ins would be supported by all of us but we must ask if the legislation is a deterrent and the extent to which it will assist people to defend themselves.  Many of the people we are thinking of could not defend themselves against able-bodied intruders.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  Fine Gael has been asking for a Bill for four years that would address the situation whereby people were unsure how to defend themselves, their families and their property.  Myths were growing up that the burglar was all powerful once he came in and no defence was possible without a high risk to the property owner.  It was perhaps a myth but the situation arose where those who defended themselves found themselves in difficulty with the law.This Bill provides protection for people and gives them the opportunity to defend themselves, their families and their property in the event of burglary or tiger kidnapping.  These are frightening situations for those working in banks and they should be allowed to defend themselves in such situations.  The Bill must address this because people should feel safe in their homes.  They feel at present that they must withdraw if there is an intruder and it is important that we send a message to those who would intrude that the freedom to go about their dastardly deeds will be confronted.I have personal experience in my community of the robbery and beating up of old people.  It is sad to see an elderly person living alone who has been robbed.  Such people are terrified and injured, go to hospital and, despite being physically able, cannot return home out of fear.  They are elderly and not as physically active as they used to be but they could survive on their own with home help.  However, they are too afraid of returning home.  After living their lives working hard to rear families that have now gone and looking forward to enjoying their old age, having this type of burglary visited upon them is one of the most dastardly crimes possible.I will cite some of the statistics on burglary and other offences.  In recent years, crime levels have increased.  According to the Central Statistics Office there were 23,603 recorded burglaries in 2007.  By 2009, that figured had increased to 26,877.  Not including aggravated burglaries as described in the CSO report, there were 23,052 and 26,072 burglaries in 2007 and 2009, respectively.  This increase of approximately 3,000 is similar to that of the previous category.  In 2007, there were 2,171 robbery, extortion and hijacking offences.  In 2009, there were 2,487 such offences.  In 2007, there were 814 cases of robbery of an establishment or institution.  In 2009, this figure increased to 1,030.  According to the CSO, the number of robberies and burglaries rose by one third in the second quarter of 2010.  The number of robbery, extortion and hijacking offences increased by almost 34% from 575 to 770.  There were 1,659 recorded offences of robbery against individuals during that period, representing a rise of more than 37% compared with the same quarter in 2009.  The quarterly figures for robbery, extortion and hijacking offences increased by more than 24% from 676 in the first quarter of 2009 to 840 in the first quarter of 2010.The Government and the Minister are losing the fight to reduce levels of crime, including robberies and violence.  The Government's approach to the issues of criminal activity and safety must be re-examined urgently.  While the Bill is a step in that respect, crime levels are rising and people are afraid.  Given the advent of drugs and the considerable increase in alcohol consumption, many burglaries are committed by people who are intoxicated with drugs or alcohol.  They are not in full control of their faculties and cannot judge a situation, regardless of the evil they are doing.While welcoming the Bill, people must be mindful of their safety and that of their families when confronting someone.  Even while a person is panicking, stressed and terrified, he or she must make a judgment as to how much violence to use in the defence of his or her property, family and self.  We hope that research in this regard will be published to advise people on how to respond to a situation with which they are presented.  The Bill, when enacted, could be complemented through television and radio advertising that would explain the extent of the legislation, its implications after being passed and the dangers of responding to a potentially risky situation.  Someone who is highly intoxicated and looking for money for drugs with a loaded gun is a dangerous cocktail, a fact of which we must be conscious.The Bill addresses the issue of an intruder entering a property where a person feels the need to protect himself or herself and the matter of the property itself being stolen.  The Minister outlined that section 2 provides a mixture of objective and subjective tests in determining whether the use of force is justified by an individual in his or her home who is confronted by an intruder.  I will refer to this matter later.  Section 2(1) states:[I]t shall not be an offence for a person who is in his or her dwelling, or for a person who is a lawful occupant in a dwelling, to use force against another person or the property of another person where—(a) he or she believes the other person has entered or is entering the dwelling as a trespasser for the purpose of committing a criminal act,This provision is based on the assumption that a person must believe someone has entered that person's property as a trespasser for the purpose of committing a criminal act.  Before engaging in violence, one must be satisfied in one's own mind.  While this provision qualifies the situation of responding to intruders, one can quickly read whether someone entering a dwelling believes the house is empty, in that the person tries to leave quickly upon seeing it is not empty for fear of being caught.  One must judge whether the danger has moved on and the criminal act will not occur.  Seriously injuring a person in such a situation could be questionable, as one must have a good reason to believe the person is violent.  While this is so in 95% of cases, we all know of situations of young people who burgled houses they believed were empty, but got out as quickly as they could when they heard noises upstairs.  In other words, one must believe that someone has entered one's home to commit a criminal act and the force one uses must be reasonable.Fine Gael believes people must feel safe in their homes and use reasonable force to protect their property.  We have tabled two Private Members' Bills on this matter in the past four years, including one sponsored by Deputies Ring and Charles Flanagan.  I often regret that the Government will accept Private Members' Bills only occasionally, when there is a level of reasonableness and agreement and an understanding that everyone is on the same side.  I do not understand the political reasons fully, but the fear is that the Opposition will claim credibility on the basis of non-Government legislation.  Nobody has a 100% call on what is good for society.  If Oppositions are reasonable in putting forward issues, it is very regrettable that, for political reasons, these are turned down with perhaps a promise that something will be done.  When the matter is put to bed, however, this action never happens.Deputy O'Shea mentioned that nobody locked their door in rural Ireland.  I remember that well and indeed up to ten years ago I did not lock my car.  However, it suddenly dawned on me that things were changing in this society.  We find now that people are frightened, especially elderly people, and we are very conscious of this when we go canvassing and meeting people at their doors.  When a certain time in the evening comes, one does not call to doors for fear of frightening people.  One suspends one's canvassing for that very reason.The Bill will let people know where they stand when their privacy is invaded.  We must be concerned and must temper our defence when confronted with weapons, be they guns, crowbars or any other item that could inflict injury.  We must have a balanced approach to defending ourselves and be careful that life is not put in danger.  Deputy Shatter stated that according to the Bill not alone is the house considered a property, but so is the curtilage, namely, the back and front gardens.  Deputy Shatter said one does not shoot a guy because he is out in the back garden stealing one's lawnmower or shovel.  There must be balance in the approach to defending property so that life is not recklessly put in danger in such circumstances.I welcome the Bill.  It clarifies a situation which had become very difficult, especially since the Nally case in the west which clearly divided public opinion on the issue.  There are people who will say there are dangerous elements in this Bill, that it may allow a certain level of recklessness.  However, a level of recklessness currently exists regarding the safety of people in their homes concerning which I gave statistics.  That recklessness must be confronted.  This is one measure of confronting it but the Government must also consider other measures to ensure that the statistics, as I outlined them, do not continue to increase as more and more people are put at risk.  People must be advised on how to protect themselves, especially elderly people who suffer spates of attacks.  At one stage there was such a spate of attacks in the west that it was like an epidemic, which was seriously upsetting.We welcome the Bill and hope it will have a quick passage through the Dáil and Seanad.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I thank Deputies on both sides of the House for the positive comments they made on this Bill.  I hope, as Deputy Shatter stated, we can proceed to its passing.  It is a relatively short Bill and does not warrant much amendment.  Deputy Shatter criticised the Government for not introducing it before but, as I noted, the Law Reform Commission was making an examination of the issue of defences in general and we felt we should wait until that had been considered.Deputy Shatter referred to previous Bills tabled by Fine Gael, including the Criminal Law Home Defence Bill 2006, sponsored by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  Although the principle of that Bill was laudable, the Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill 2009, sponsored by Deputies Charlie Flanagan and Michael Ring, was a copy of the 2006 Bill which was rejected by the House on the basis of advice given to Government in regard to its sustainability.  It contained some flaws.  In the 2009 Fine Gael Private Members' Bill there was a presumption that force used by an occupier against a trespasser was reasonable.  The Attorney General stated this was too broad and too blunt.  For example, it would have presumed it was reasonable to use force against a child who innocently wandered into a house.  The issue of a child wandering into an orchard to take an apple was raised.  Ultimately this Bill is based on common sense and what is reasonable.  If a child wanders into an orchard to steal an apple, any response using physical or lethal force would be totally disproportionate and would fall outside the remit of this Bill which would provide no protection to anybody using force in those circumstances.The Fine Gael Private Members' Bill did not deal with a situation in the Bill where, in the event of a child innocently wandering into a house, there was a presumption that force could be used.  It also failed to place any restriction on the circumstances in which such force might be used and did not deal with the issue of curtilage.  That Bill was silent in that respect.  It only afforded protection to the occupier while within the strict confines of the dwelling.  The current Bill takes a common sense approach that allows the occupier to take reasonable defensive action within the curtilage of the dwelling.  The 2009 Private Members' Bill went too far in allowing an occupier to intentionally or recklessly engage in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.  Under the current Bill, although the actions of an occupier may result in harm to another, the occupier's motivation must be that of protecting against harm to persons or damage to property.  The actions must be reasonable.  Those are reasons the previous Bills were rejected by Government as being too blunt and too broad in their construction.On this Bill we took the Attorney General's advice regarding its constitutionality.  The framers of the Constitution clearly recognised the central importance of the dwelling in the life of every citizen and provided for that in the Constitution.  That has been recognised in laws passed since the Constitution was put in place and this Bill follows that constitutional provision.  It is necessary to say it does not give a licence to kill, or a charter for any person to have a go by vigilantism, or whatever, as certain people outside the House have suggested.  On the other hand, Deputy Rabbitte called it a slight measure.  It is not a slight measure but a balanced Bill that recognises the right of a lawful occupier to use reasonable force against anybody that he or she believes is trespassing on his or her property with criminal intent.A number of Deputies raised the issue of curtilage which was looked at very closely by the Attorney General.  The scope of the previous Private Members' Bill was only in regard to the actual dwelling but there are circumstances when the criminal act may start in the dwelling and then move to a yard or driveway, or wherever.  That was a major fault in that Bill.  However, I can understand that the definition of curtilage is somewhat difficult.    The framing of this is to ensure that while it is possibly wider than that,  the area involved should be used in conjunction with, and for the enjoyment of the dwelling.  Obviously, it would be up to a court or a jury to decide on that.The Attorney General has examined the question of constitutional protection for the dwelling carefully and advised on the particular course set out in the Bill for definition of curtilage, by extending the protection contained in section 2 for householders' actions only as far as the curtilage.  The Bill recognises the limits of the doctrine of constitutional inviolability of the dwelling.  It also draws on the case law to make it clear that a householder cannot be expected to retreat from the home.A number of Deputies, including Deputy Sargent, raised this in their contributions.  Indeed Deputy Sargent raised this with me, personally.  They referred to the Law Reform Commission's report on defences in the criminal law, part of which this legislation is based on.  They had recommended an approach that would replace the reasonableness test by criteria already embedded in that concept — threshold, immanence, necessity and proportionality.  The Law Reform Commission was recommending an approach to the general law on defences, as I said in my general contribution, and its recommendations anticipated codification of the criminal law.  To have adopted the approach recommended by the Law Reform Commission would have required changing the law on defences, generally.  The concept of reasonableness is long known to Irish law, and one that is amenable both to judicial direction and indeed to a common sense understanding, as I said before.  This Bill is based on common sense and on what is reasonable in the particular circumstances pertaining to an instance.The whole issue of reasonableness is a concept that juries have applied without too much difficulty over the years.  Crucially, however, it implicitly embodies the concepts enumerated by the Law Reform Commission while rightly allowing for a rounded consideration of all the circumstances in every case.  However, the Law Reform Commission report generally was based on a codification of the law on defences and we are not at that stage in that respect.  Given that this Bill was necessary, I believe it was the view of most Members of the House that we should deal with this particular aspect on its merits.  It was felt that we should pick this piece out of the Law Reform Commission's report.I gave an undertaking that once the Law Reform Commission's report was published, we would publish our own Bill within a relatively short space of time, which we did.Deputy Shatter raised the issue of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Bill has to be construed both in the light of the inviolability of dwelling provisions, Article 40(5) of the Constitution, but also in the light of the guarantee as regards the protection of human life in Articles 40(3) and also in the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Bill was drafted in consultation with the Attorney General, who would always have regard for the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.I reiterate that the Bill does not seek to authorise the use of force, lethal or otherwise, which is unreasonable or unnecessary.  A number of Deputies raised the question as to whether I had considered the views of the Human Rights Commission on this.  My officials had initial discussions with the commission, but as yet I do not believe we have received submissions from it.  I expect it to publish its observations on the Bill shortly.A number of Deputies raised the issue of the various types of assistance on offer such as "community alert" and "neighbourhood watch".  My Department has provided substantial support over the years for the community alert programme.  There are 1,351 such schemes in operation throughout the country.  Some Deputies referred to the Garda Síochána's older people's strategy, which I and the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady launched recently, along with the Garda Commissioner.  It sets out current and future initiatives to be taken by the Garda Síochána, working with members of the general public to assist older people who consider themselves under threat or victims of crime.  I compliment the Garda Síochána on the initiative it has taken in that respect.A number of Deputies referred to community policing.  The latest available figures show that 1,038 gardaí were specifically assigned to community policing as at the end of August 2010.  Obviously, every garda is expected to have an awareness of the community he or she is living in, but this is a specific initiative involving dedicated community police, men and women.  Since the end of 2007 there has been a 70% increase in the number of community gardaí, which again shows the Garda Síochána is very much aware of the necessity.  The Garda Commissioner and I, some time back, relaunched the community policing project in Ballymun.  I know from my talks with members of the Garda management that they are great supporters of community policing.  I commend them because, while we need to have the specialised Garda units, equally the garda on the beat who is known to the people at community level and vice versa is vitally important.A number of Deputies raised the seniors alert scheme which replaced the scheme of community support for older people.  Deputy Carey raised the matter of grant assistance.  This scheme, which is in place, provides grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of equipment.  When I was Minister for Social and Family Affairs I found this an excellent scheme.  It was passed on to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, which is now the lead Department in that respect.Another initiative is the neighbourhood watch strategy for 2007-11.  The Garda authorities inform me that there are currently 2,340 neighbourhood watch schemes in operation around the country.  Obviously, they work very closely with An Garda Síochána.  Deputies Flynn, Chris Andrews and Ferris mentioned the effective deployment of the Garda Síochána, as did Deputy Rabbitte in respect of Fettercairn.  Ultimately, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to determine where gardaí are to be based.  That is continually being monitored and reviewed and optimum use is made of Garda resources.  The resources of divisional Garda units throughout the country are augmented by national units such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the special detective unit, the Garda national drugs unit, the organised crime unit and other elements of the Garda Síochána's support services.  As of 31 August 2010 the latest available figures show that there were 14,615 gardaí, with a further nine in training.  There is a total of 1,038 community gardaí, 112 juvenile liaison officers, 1,035 members of the traffic corps and 629 Garda reservists.  That is an all-time high level for gardaí in the history of the State.Deputies Creighton, Chris Andrews and others raised the issue of tougher sentences for crimes.  We have made this point and that is one reason there are substantial numbers in our prisons today.  Over the past 20 years or so the Oireachtas has increased sentences fairly dramatically.  Every time there is major publicity about a crime, with sections of the media crying for tougher sentences, obviously the political process responds.  The knock-on effect, however, is that the more substantial the sentences being laid down in legislation, the longer the sentences handed down by the Judiciary.The average life sentence now is approximately 17 years, whereas not so long ago — perhaps 15 or 20 years ago — it was only seven and a half years.  I have had discussions previously with the Attorney General on the issue of mandatory sentencing, particularly for burglary and aggravated burglary involving older people.  The Attorney General has asked the Law Reform Commission, under the legislation, to consider this issue.  I remind Deputies that in the Criminal Justice Act 2007 we provided the courts with the power to make monitoring orders on persons convicted of aggravated burglary, for which, as I already said, there is a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  The courts may also make protection of persons orders prohibiting offenders from engaging in any activity or behaviour that would cause the victim of the offence fear, distress, alarm or intimidation.  The same Act provides for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat offenders.Deputy Kenneally expressed concern about section 6.  I assure the Deputy that the intention of this section is to provide a defence for the householder who may have used force against someone entering the dwelling to commit a crime, and not for the intruder.  The fact that the intruder may fall into one of the categories set out in the section does not mean it can be concluded that the act perpetrated on entering the dwelling was not criminal.I think the Deputies for their general support for this Bill.  It clarifies the existing law, which was more or less laid down in DPP v. Barnes.  It also extends the existing provisions, particularly with regard to the issue of curtilage, which it clarifies.  In addition, it clarifies that the householder is not subject to the possibility of a claim for damages by an intruder in the event of the intruder’s being injured.This is a balanced Bill.  There have been some suggestions, mainly outside the House, that it is a charter for what may be termed "have-a-go vigilantes", but this is not the case.  Rather than merely giving the Judiciary the ability to deal with particular cases, it will send a strong signal to the people who perpetrate these crimes that they are facing a hazard not just in terms of their ultimate culpability once they are found guilty but also in the case that they enter someone's home.The Bill follows on from the constitutional provisions regarding property.  Deputy Rabbitte mentioned the possibility of limiting the provisions to certain properties, but I do not accept that.  It is important that our legislation reflects the special position of the dwelling in our Constitution and the inviolability of the dwelling house for every citizen.  The dwelling and the people therein must have special protection from the Oireachtas and this Bill achieves that.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Food Harvest 2020 report in Dáil Éireann.  This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate Deputy Andrew Doyle on his appointment as Fine Gael spokesperson on agriculture, fisheries and food.  I look forward to working with him over the next few years.  I also take the opportunity to compliment Deputy Michael Creed on his work as spokesperson for his party over the past number of years.I do not need to emphasise to the House the important role played by the agri-food, forestry and fisheries sector in the Irish economy and rural society or the contribution it can make to our national economic recovery.  If we make the correct decisions now, the harvest will be great.  The 2020 report provides a comprehensive and considered roadmap for the development of Ireland's most important indigenous sector.Over the past decade, the Irish agri-food, forestry and fisheries sector has been competing successfully on the world stage and has demonstrated its capacity to perform as a major player in the global food and drink market.  Currently, 85% of our food and fish output is exported to more than 160 countries, which provides a sound and well-established footing for this home-grown industry to be one of the central components of the export-driven recovery.  This multi-million euro export industry has undergone continuous development over the past decade and has turned the various challenges encountered into growth opportunities.  Such dynamism has enabled the agri-food sector, our largest manufacturing sector, to flourish and to steadily increase the value of exports.In the last two years the sector has faced new challenges due to the global downturn and unfavourable exchange rates.  However, there are significant signs of recovery this year and in the medium to longer term the sector will be presented with tremendous opportunities because of rising food demand in global markets.  In this context, it was clear that a new strategic vision was needed to ensure that this valuable sector continued to develop to its full potential and be to the forefront of our economic recovery.  Therefore, last February I appointed the 2020 committee to prepare a blueprint for the development of the sector into the next decade.  This industry-led committee was a diverse, focused and effective group.  Its report, Food Harvest 2020, which was presented to Government in July, reflects the wide-ranging expertise of the committee members.  It builds on the comprehensive analytical papers prepared by my Department and relevant State bodies as well as the ideas that emerged from the public consultation process and the input of the Harvard Business School and senior farming and food industry figures at a Bord Bia-sponsored conference at Farmleigh.As expected, the report is very detailed.  It provides more than 200 recommendations and suggestions towards which the Government and private enterprise will work.  The key focus of Food Harvest 2020 is to show how the industry can capitalise on the expanding market opportunities.  These opportunities arise from the actual and projected increase in food demand due to rising world population and increasing wealth, matched with our ability to produce high-quality products using environmentally sustainable production methods.A global increase in demand for food will inevitably follow the current surge in world population, which is forecast to reach 8 billion by 2025.  Growth in demand for dairy produce is likely to be a particularly strong element due to rising global incomes, which presents an opportunity for our dairy sector.  The ending of EU milk quotas in 2015 presents the sector with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to significantly increase our milk output, achieve a change in the scale of our dairy sector and capitalise on the significant cost advantage of our environmentally sustainable grass-based production system.Besides outlining the opportunities, Food Harvest 2020 sets a number of challenging but achievable growth targets.  The principal targets include the following: increasing the value of primary output of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by €1.5 billion, which is a 33% increase on the 2007-09 average; improving the value added in the sector by €3 billion, a 40% increase compared to 2008; achieving an export target of €12 billion for the sector, a 42% increase compared to the 2007-09 average; increasing milk production by 50%; and adding 20% to the value of the beef sector.  In addition, the report points out that we must improve our cost competitiveness by 20% relative to our competitors, and industry spending on research and development must also double.These are unquestionably ambitious targets, but the sector has real substance: it has the capacity, it has high-quality products, and it has a growing market.  I firmly believe we can achieve these targets and I am fully committed to my role in realising this vision.  I am aware that it will require a high level of commitment and collaboration from all players in the sector.  It is my intention to harness the commitment, ability and positivity that pervades this sector and ensure that we all do what is necessary to achieve these targets.Food Harvest 2020 gives us a roadmap and a framework for future expansion, which is best expressed as smart green growth.  The phrase "green growth" implies the creation of a strong link for consumers between Irish food, high environmental standards and sustainable production.This link between "green" and Irish should be used as a springboard for growing our industry.Irish food has always been associated with green, natural and sustainable food production based on our extensive, low input, grass-based production systems.  Added to that is our abundant supply of fresh water, which is the envy of producers elsewhere, and the important role that our family farms play in maintaining our rural landscape with its rich biodiversity.  All these factors combine in affording real marketing advantage, as they fit well with the growing consumer awareness of the environment, animal welfare and ethical production methods.  This constitutes a key competitive advantage for us, provided that we can demonstrate to our international customers that our production methods really are more sustainable than those of our competitors.I am not referring here to a superficial marketing ploy, nor indeed one which will be achieved overnight.  To be successful, we must be able to substantiate fully our green credentials and base our environmental credibility on well founded research.  We will have to adopt environmentally sustainable practices at all levels throughout the food chain to meet internationally recognised standards.  This will take time and commitment but is necessary to underpin our environmental sustainability and avoid any suggestion of mere, what may be termed, "green-washing".The good news is that we are not starting from scratch.  We already have an established green image and we farm to environmental standards that go beyond the basic requirements of good farming practice.  Indeed, Bord Bia already employs the theme "Ireland the Food Island" for its marketing campaigns.  There are good grounds for building on this image to differentiate, market and obtain a premium price for our food produce.Another avenue to be explored is the creation of an umbrella brand for Irish food and drink, based to a large extent on sound environmental credentials.  This would have the dual purpose of harnessing Ireland's existing green image and also building a national brand to differentiate Irish products from its competitors.  Such a brand image could also be linked to a wider tourism strategy.  This idea certainly has potential and it is one which I would most definitely like to see developed further.  However, I recognise, as did the Food Harvest 2020 committee, that its realisation will involve detailed consideration and planning as well as considerable realignment of industry, producer and State resources.Acting smart is also central to the approach recommended in Food Harvest 2020.  Acting smart means that our principal focus must be on ensuring competitiveness and sustaining growth.  It implies being innovative and at the top of our game in availing of best practice options and lean manufacturing techniques.  It involves investing in research and marketing, rethinking business relationships and creating more effective business models.Smart growth will involve all industry stakeholders in examining and updating their own skills, processes, products, markets and relationships to ensure that they can deliver long-term sustainable growth.  The Government has consistently supported the growth and development of the agri-food and fisheries sector and will continue to facilitate business expansion but fundamentally, sustainable growth and job creation will result from the efforts of industry stakeholders themselves.All parties must act in collaboration and play their part in achieving this growth.  Primary producers will need to accelerate their uptake of emerging technology and best practice options in genomics, animal health and husbandry.  The industry-led Food Harvest 2020 committee emphasised that consolidation and rationalisation of processing capacity is critical to maintaining competitiveness and future viability.This is an industry with real strength and real opportunities.  The challenge is to build on our existing knowledge and capabilities to ensure that we remain at the forefront of the industry.  We are fortunate in that our best farmers are technically advanced and that cutting edge technology is already being used to add value to much of the food that we produce.  The significant State investment in food research and centres of excellence over the years has paid dividends and has been a major resource for the Irish food industry.  However, active industry collaboration and increased research investment will be critical to the development of innovative food products, such as nutraceuticals and other functional foods.I have established a high level implementation committee and I chair its meetings to ensure that the implementation process results in a convincing and effective joined-up approach by State agencies.  I also want to give a clear message to the participants and to our citizens that this task is a priority, that it is national rather than sectoral, and will involve all stakeholders.  At our inaugural meeting of 16 September, I emphasised to the committee that its key function was to direct and take whatever action was necessary to successfully implement 2020 strategy.  At that meeting we agreed on the processes which will best realise the sector's full potential advance.I am very conscious of the critical timeline for the dairy sector and of the importance of ensuring that the current opportunities are fully realised.  I have already established the dairy expansion activation group and given it a specific remit and timetable for action.  By the end of November, this small group of farmers, processors and Teagasc officials will submit an initial road map to the high level committee highlighting the key milestones from the production and processing perspectives, identifying obstacles to implementation and how these should be overcome.  The next meeting of the high level committee is scheduled for 10 November and will deal with the beef sector, brand Ireland and the sustainability agenda, and competitiveness.I wish to share the remaining ten minutes of my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe.

Given the overview just provided by the Minister, I want to focus on a couple of aspects of the Food Harvest 2020 report and then address horticulture and organics, which are my areas of specific responsibility.The Minister said that we will have to adopt environmentally sustainable practices at all levels throughout the food chain to meet internationally recognised standards.  This approach, as articulated in the report under the "Think Green" heading, has the potential to provide real benefits to both our environment and the profitability of Irish agriculture.  By putting in place truly sustainable agriculture production systems, we will ensure that our domestic food production will become resilient and in a better position to cope with the adverse affects of climate change and the reduction in availability of oil.  All countries will have to come to terms with coping with these changes.  By planning and adapting now to meet these challenges Irish agriculture can get a head start on its competitors and by providing robust certification of sustainable production, Irish food produce can achieve a real dividend in the marketplace.I am aware that Bord Bia is working closely with the Carbon Trust in this regard and I look forward to learning of the outcome of their efforts.  Both the Bord Bia commissioned "Pathways for Growth" and the Food Harvest 2020 report recognise the potential value of building a strong "Brand Ireland" image.  This approach can benefit all, but in particular would help those involved in the artisan and speciality food sector.  This weekend I am attending the Terra Madre conference and exhibition in Turin, where Bord Bia is working with Irish producers to promote food produce from this sector and I look forward to learning more on how we can continued to develop in this important area.The horticulture sector has performed well over the past decade and has grown to be a significant entity within the overall agricultural industry.  Horticulture now contributes around €370 million, including potatoes, to farm output.  It makes an important economic contribution in supplying the domestic market, providing employment opportunities and foreign trade earnings.  In addition, the sector generates significant additional jobs in ancillary sectors such as distribution, retail and landscaping.The area and proportion of production under protection from the weather has increased significantly.  Improvements in the quality and presentation of Irish produce over the past decade have also been significant and quality of output, hygiene and food safety have all become critical issues for the sector.  The industry is labour-intensive, employing approximately 18,500 people across the food and non-food areas, and employment is broadly based across the country.Ireland is estimated to be 24% self-sufficient in fruit and 85% self-sufficient in vegetables.  These figures are based on produce which can be grown domestically.  Significant quantities of fruit, such as tropical and citrus varieties, must be imported as well as large quantities of ornamental plants.  Mushroom production, with a value in excess of €100 million, is the only domestic crop where there are significant exports, with more than 70% of production being exported to the UK.My Department continues to support the development of the horticulture sector.  Support has been provided through the grant aid scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Funding provided under the scheme underpins capital investment on farms that will encourage environmentally friendly practices, improve working conditions, improve the quality of produce and promote diversification of activities.  This investment contributes significantly to the growth and development of the horticulture sector across all areas, including the protected crops, field vegetables, nursery crops, mushrooms, soft fruit, apples and the beekeeping sectors.  In addition, financial support continues to be available to those producers who participate in the producer organisation scheme.  This EU scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to become part of a larger supply base, to concentrate on marketing and improve quality.  My Department also provides funding to Bord Bia and Teagasc towards their work in the horticultural industry.Horticulture continues to offer considerable potential for future development but the sector has been experiencing particular challenges in recent times, not least from the strong competitive pressures imposed by the highly concentrated retail marketplace, the supermarket multiples and from competitively priced imports.  In addition, difficult growing conditions due to adverse weather experienced during 2008 and 2009 impacted on growers' returns.  This was further compounded by significant damage to crops and plants arising from the severe frosts experienced in early 2010.  As we all know it was a long, tough, hard winter and the people who know that best are those working in the farming sector.  The general economic downturn has also impacted on the sector.  Demand for production from the amenity sector has fallen significantly owing to the slowdown in the construction sector.The Food Harvest 2020 report recognises that the sector and the food service market offer opportunities to replace imports with home-grown seasonal produce, to supply our organic market and to diversify in order to meet ethnic food demands.  Bord Bia will continue to provide support to operators in the horticulture sector to develop new markets by way of assistance in the areas of product innovation and marketing skills.  Bord Bia is also involved in a number of campaigns to promote demand for horticultural produce including the incredible edibles initiative, which is an educational initiative for primary school children that is funded by industry and Bord Bia and facilitated by my Department.  It aims to increase fresh fruit and vegetable consumption as part of a healthy diet and we need such initiatives at a time when there is a growing focus on the impact of obesity not just on older people, but also on our children.Further to the recommendations and proposals contained in the horticulture section of the Food Harvest 2020 report, I intend to establish shortly, within the overall implementation framework for Food Harvest 2020, a horticulture action group to oversee implementation of the findings relating to the sector.  This group will play a key role in determining how best to organise implementation of the recommendations in this important and complex sector.  The group will, in turn, report back to the high-level committee, established and chaired by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, which is responsible for the overall implementation of the report.  As the report itself recognises, it is also vital that the future potential of horticulture is considered in tandem with the other general farm and agriculture industry level recommendations set out in this important document.I also intend that Forás Orgánach will play an important role in the implementation process.  Organic farming and organic food are in a particularly good position to benefit from the implementation of the recommendations.  Organic food production is currently the most sustainable agriculture production method.  Organic produce is already certified to the most exacting standards.  As this certification is already in place, organic food and food products are in an advantageous position to exploit the strategies as outlined in Food Harvest 2020 and Bord Bia's Pathways to Growth.  Opportunity abounds in the domestic organic retail market.  It is currently worth €94 million and a large portion of this produce is imported.Shortly, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, for which I also hold certain responsibilities, will publish the new national action plan on green public procurement.  This action plan on public procurement for food will make particular provision for organic food in accordance with the commitment in the renewed programme for Government.Apart from the domestic market, major export opportunities for Irish organic produce are to be found in the major European markets.  For example, the UK market is estimated to be worth £1.85 billion and the German organic market is worth €5.85 billion.  Bord Bia ran a trade workshop recently during national organic week to help producers devise strategies to exploit this lucrative market.  I would encourage more farmers to consider making the switch to organic and we are helping out with the conversion process.Food Harvest 2020 offers Irish agriculture an opportunity to establish real resilience in food production and position our produce to exploit the premier lines in international markets.

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I welcome the Food Harvest 2020 report prepared by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The Minister has outlined the backdrop of the global increased need for food and the limited number of places on the planet that will be able to produce it.  In light of all we have heard in recent weeks about the state of our economy, when we see an industry with the potential to grow, we certainly need reports like this, but we also need action.  The report presents a constructive catalogue of actions which need to be taken to develop Ireland's agrifood sector.The Taoiseach has said more than 4,000 jobs could be created by increasing milk output by 50%, beef output by 20% and other sectors equivalently.  I am very glad that the Government has woken up to the fact that the humble cow produces €1.1 billion worth of milk.  Everyone accepts we can develop our agrifood sector and increase exports from €7 billion to €12 billion.  All the additional economic activity and tax take that would create would be very welcome given the current budget deficit.While we can create thousands of new jobs in food companies and on farms, asking the farmers to double their production is not going to be enough, and asking farmers to be green and smart is not enough.  We need to be smart in the way we organise what we, as legislators, do from here.  Smart farmers are looking at whether they can survive another collapse in the price of milk and continuing low prices and volatility in other sectors in recent years which brought the average farm income down to €11,968 according to Teagasc.  Smart farmers are wondering whether they should recommend their son or daughter to choose farming as a career path or look for an alternative.  Smart farmers are wondering why the income at which a farm is considered viable in the Food Harvest 2020 report at €14,908 is only just above the poverty level.  While I am not trying to be critical of the report, it is a fundamental weakness to base its projections from this point.Having a brand has been mentioned here and is certainly addressed in the Bord Bia Pathways to Growth document.  We have a brand and we have a green image on which we need to capitalise.  Everyone along the way needs to benefit and be seen to be given a fair deal.  We produce lots of grass; it is a natural resource that no other country has to the level we have.  We have no oil, iron or coal, but we have 4.4 million hectares that are still fit for growing the best of diary cows, cattle, sheep and crops, and it has not been built on, poisoned or compromised.  Grass provides the food for more than 80% of agricultural output and is the raw material for the multi-billion euro dairy industry.  It is what gives us a competitive edge on our European competitors.  The significant growth which is identified in the Food Harvest 2020 report and the consequent jobs in the rural farming sector need to be explained and we need clarification on the actions that need to happen.We still have skilled, hard working, innovative workers on the land, who believe in the future of agriculture or they would not have stuck with it in recent years.  They believe in the value of high quality product and have made significant investments of time and money on infrastructure to sweat their asset as much as they can and to turn it into real income.  We can develop a smart economy on the basis of a manufacturing industry.I spoke to third year students from two schools who were visiting the Houses this morning.  I encouraged them to consider careers in the food science technology area.  If we are to create high-end jobs, those are the areas in which people will have to be specifically trained in research.  The technology developed from such research can be sold to other countries and this will enable us to develop a smart economy in this area.  We will not develop a smart economy that will create any level of work from simply talking about having a smart economy.  It must be built from the ground up.Our agricultural output has grown since we joined the EU in 1973.  Although dairy farmers have increased output per cow by 14%, the price received from their investment and effort by dropped by 22% since 2000.  The Celtic tiger certainly has not benefited most farmers, rather it passed them by.  The average farm income in 2009 was lower than it was in 2002.  I am not sure if any other sector can claim to have lost income during the Celtic tiger years.  As every self-employed person is aware, if one cannot pay one's costs, one's business will close.  Smart farmers are asking how €5.4 billion of farmers' debt or investment, depending on the way one views it, will be paid if EU supports are cut, no alternative is offered, and the prices farmers get do not cover their costs.Why are farmers in debt?  Why are farmers going out of business and leaving farming despite Ireland's competitive edge?  What about the bill of €4.9 billion for imported food and drink?  What is the Minister doing about this?  The Minister is exhorting the farmers to double their bets in regard to 2020 vision, with no attempt to analyse the real problems facing the sector.  Does he accept that realising what is contained in 2020 vision starts with himself?  It starts with his Department.  The first smart action that needs to be taken is to examine the way the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does its business.  We have seen the painful results of the property boom where growth without a plan becomes a cancer that eats up our resources.  The most urgent issue is the impending cuts to the budget.   Has the Department prepared any costings for implementing the 2020 vision?  Has it any idea what is the available budget for it?There are already 10,000 farmers in receipt of farmers' dole or farm assist costing almost €100 million.  If the figure of €14,000 odd is taken as being a farm income, the number I mentioned will at least double.  All that would result from that would be the transfer of funds from one Department to another and a lowering of farmers' self-esteem to a point where they will no longer be motivated.I welcome the action plans mentioned by the Minister at the end of his contribution.  However, the Minister seemed at one stage to be presiding over an economic crisis like an absentee landlord with an attitude of let them sort it out themselves, let them emigrate.  It is no longer enough for the Department to be an EU scheme processing division.Just as the Central Bank forgot about its role in managing Ireland's money supply when the EU took over monetary policy, the Department forgot about strategic planning for the Irish agrifood sector when the EU took over agriculture policy.  When will the Minister realise that the agrifood sector needs a leader who will face facts, who will lead a co-ordinated strategy for survival, as well as expansion?  Even while negotiations are taking place on the reform the Common Agricultural Policy, Ireland needs a leader who will work with all those in the business to prepare multiannual plans for stocking land, shelves and shopping baskets, which are vital to create jobs and generate income; and to eliminate the volatility in the marketplace and the price and income projections for those who have €5.4 billion of debts to honour.  We need a leader who must come clean about grant aid and account for every euro of taxpayers' money, who will reorganise a team to the maximum efficiency and who will innovate.Fine Gael's priorities in the agrifood sector are based on a decent standard of living for those producing and working in that sector; a sustainable, innovative production cycle based on sustainability, animal welfare and the environment — I agree with some of what the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe said, although not all of it — it is a scarce resource, but we have plenty of it and we should manage it.  We should give serious consideration to developing a brand denoting a labelled, certified high quality product.  That is the type of product we produce but there is no point in having it unless we tell everybody we have it.  Marketing is key to the development of this sector.  If we are to achieve its growth, we want to guard against not having anywhere to sell it.  A term used in the document Pathways for Growth is the phrase "co-opetition" rather than competition whereby people in the production end do not see themselves as adversaries but as partners.  As I mentioned previously, a person said to me at the National Ploughing Championships that we should establish an OPEC-type organisation of food exporting nations, of which there are not that many.  The key to achieving growth is to be able to sell our product.  That cannot be emphasised enough.  To develop high-end jobs in this sector, we must put smart money into smart research, which will allow us to be ahead of the game in innovation.  When we developed the sugar beet industry, we developed a sector of expertise in Armer Salmon with the production of machinery to sow, spray and harvest sugar beet.  That is an example of how one develops a smart economy.I will list the priorities in this sector, which colleagues may deal with later.  They are CAP reform, fair trade and ensuring young farmers gain control of the land although not necessarily land ownership.  This will take innovative and imaginative thinking not only by the Minister's Department but by people in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioner on how to make that happen and to encourage it.  Some tax incentives are good, although not all are.  We should examine the granting of enhanced stock relief if we are to have a level of expansion, otherwise people will have a paper profit with a tax bill that bears no relation to their income.  These are practical measures that must be examined across the  Departments.  Sectoral development is also required.I will mention only one sector, that of forestry, due to the time I have remaining.  We have acknowledged that forestry is an important sector.  We have 9% land cover under forestry with a target of 10,000 hectares per annum to reach a 17% target, yet the funding for the sector has been cut.   If ever there was smart investment, it would be in the forestry sector.  We cannot strangle this sector, which provides jobs in wider industry outside agriculture.  I appeal to the Minister to make every effort to ensure funding for it is not cut before it begins to develop.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	288	Farm income fell nationally by 40% between 2008 and 2009.  In wetland areas the fall in income was much more, but thank God weather and prices have been much better this year.I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to have a debate on agriculture but, to be blunt, it was not the debate I had asked for.  The two main issues I raised were the delay in area aid payments to such a large number of hard-pressed farmers and the difficulties in the pig industry resulting from the massive increases in feed prices and, on the other hand, the decrease in the returns by 6% to 8% per kilo.I admire the Minister's ability to get positive press comments.  I note a comment that 75% of applicants received payments within 15 days.  That sounds good but, to be blunt, it means very little to 25% who have not been paid.  My telephone is hopping off the hook with calls from people who have not yet received their area aid payments and they realise it will be a serious problem for them regarding their single premiums.  Many of these people submitted their applications last May.  The last telephone call I received before I came into the House was from a farmer in west Cavan with a fairly extensive farm.  He had a dual claim on his file, which was sorted out last May but he still has not received his area aid payment and therefore he will not get a single premium.  Furthermore, two groups are talking about bringing him to court because of the delay in obtaining payments from him and they have no guarantee as to when they will get them.  While the Minister has made some changes, it is essential as many as possible are paid as quickly as possible.  It is now over 12 months since I spoke to the Minister regarding the serious banking problems faced by many in the pig industry.  He claimed then he was leading a group to deal with the issue but some viable pig farms still depend on long-term credit from their feed suppliers 12 months on.  This, in turn, puts pressure on the feed industry while the farmers end up paying an added premium for the necessary feed meaning they cannot afford to shop around, as the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, would advise them to do.The report recommends a 50% increase in dairy production in the next ten years.  However, nothing has been done to provide the necessary marketing for any such increase.  Only last Tuesday, some of the main dairies pointed out they are holding milk prices for September, yet current quota levels have been met.  There is no point in farmers producing 50% more milk while getting 50% less for the finished product as happened in 2009.  I support the idea of producing more but it must be organised with a proper marketing structure.  Will the Minister accept it is nothing short of a national scandal that liquid milk farmers only receive 23% of what the consumer pays for their high-quality and high-cost product?  This cannot continue.  A litre of water which costs nothing to take from the ground costs more in the shops than a litre of milk.  The Competition Authority has worked only one way, that is, against organised producers trying to get a reasonable income and in favour of Tesco, Dunnes Stores and Asda, which continue to rip off all agricultural producers.  Some of these stores, such as Tesco, also repatriate massive profits to their home countries.The Minister can no longer ignore the urgent need to introduce legislation to create a level playing pitch in these areas.  If action is not taken, such as in labelling, we can never hope to create the environment for the important and achievable proposals mapped out earlier by the Minister.  If the Minister does not deal with the nitrates directive constructively, the pig, poultry and intensive dairy industries will not only be unable to expand, but will see further decrease in their production capacities.  An extension is desperately needed to retain the current nitrates regime for a limited time.  Strong constructive steps need to be taken to utilise chicken litter and pig slurry as alternative energy sources.  Deputy Doyle has suggested the high number of major pig and poultry farms in Cavan and Monaghan could lead the way in this new energy source.Over a year ago I brought it to the Minister's attention that farm waste management grants were still not paid to some farmers after they had installed waste disposal structures on their farms.  This was due to a change of personnel in the Department and views on particular waste management structures even though many of the farmers' neighbours received full grants for identical structures.  This has gone beyond a joke.  Many of these farmers have young families and are in a vulnerable position with capital and credit facilities.  Will the Minister resolve this unfair situation?According to Teagasc figures, farm incomes dropped by 40% last year but those applying for farm assist grants hit a bureaucratic stone wall with little or no understanding of their plight.  Those who had their applications turned down must wait 18 months for an appeals hearing.  The Minister must ensure these matters are dealt with quickly and fairly.Many in my constituency are concerned about the lack of funding for the proposed 10,000 hectare increase in land given over to forestry.  In 1995, some 25,000 hectares were planted with forestry.  While capital is scarce, it must be found to increase our afforestation programme.  It will assist our reductions required by climate change regulations.  For the first time in the State's history, Irish firms are exporting timber products to Britain and France.  It is one sector that can help drive growth in exports.I appreciate what the Minister has done for those left in the mushroom industry.  There used to be up to 500 farmers in mushroom production but it is now down to between 70 and 80.  The massive investment made through the years by hard-pressed sectors in the agriculture industry, such as pig and poultry producers and mushroom growers, must be recognised.  It is important the banking system is geared towards helping them out in these current economic difficulties.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13833	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The Labour Party welcomes the proposals contained in Food Harvest 2020 and that eminent persons such as Seán Brady chaired the group that comprised a wide array of stakeholders involved in the agrifood, fisheries and forestry sectors.The report is worthy of support in that its key action recognises the need to ensure the maximum possible resources are employed to drive an export-led economic recovery and the development of a smart economy.  There is a sense in which food and the agrifood sector has taken a back seat in the past 20 years because of the Government's blind faith in the construction industry.  I am glad this rearguard action has come at a time when there is a latent realisation that agriculture is vital to the country's needs and its future development.  The report's aspirations are a return to basics with clear targets and a vision set out.The agrifood sector has seen a shift over the past several years from commodity-based supply to a brand-centred and consumer-focused approach.  That, in itself, presents challenges.  How will we ensure the shift from a commodity-based supply to adding gross value to food produce?The Government's claim that the smart economy will be the foundation for economic renewal is still nebulous.  One can apply smart economy principles to the idea of food and food production but it needs to be fleshed out more.  The Food Harvest 2020 report points out the smart economy will ensure the primary producer will have higher value output and reduce costs while maintaining higher productivity.  It also claims the food industry will have more targeted research and development components, will collaborate more and will respond to the market in a more enhanced fashion.  These are wonderful terms which I would readily endorse but how will this all happen?  There should be a follow-up document to flesh out this language, which is a little too nebulous.  There should also be concrete action plans for implementing the policy, if we are to support it.  We support the aspirations in the document.  From a consumer's point of view, the smart economy can facilitate a more informed choice and lead to more innovative product ranges.  There must also be an educational component in the policy.  When we talk about the smart approach, we must include a greater partnership between industry and science, fostering the entrepreneurial culture and innovation and the need to ensure that the agrifood sector's position within the smart economy is recognised and acted on in real terms.The Labour Party agrees that we have an opportunity in this policy document to deepen the link with green issues.  Our natural environment and the fact that we have a grass-based agricultural system comprise one of our greatest comparative advantages, but the mere recognition of this fact is not sufficient.  We must develop a deeper approach to what it means.  We talk about Ireland being a green country and the opportunities arising from that comparative advantage, but how do we take that aspiration forward?  The opportunities arising from the green economy are clear from the points of view of primary producers, the food industry, consumers and the country.  There are very transparent methods of production and full traceability in food production.  This should be a comparative advantage relative to third countries that are trying to export into the European Union.  The fact that it is a grass-based agricultural system means we have natural resource benefits, as outlined in the document, but a greater role for agriculture in the economic recovery requires that European Union funding for that aim be enhanced or at least preserved at current levels.We welcome the document and the global context outlined in it.  There will be massive demand for food due to population growth.  As the document states, the world's population in 1999 passed the 6 billion threshold and is due to reach 7 billion in 2010.  By 2025, it is expected to reach 8 billion.  That presents a massive opportunity for this country.  Given the increasing desertification due to climate change in other regions and peripheral nations, Ireland's grass-based agriculture should mean it is well placed to benefit, particularly within the dairy sector where we anticipate Ireland becoming a major global player.  When we consider the dairy sector we traditionally think of brands such as Kerrygold.  Liquid milk is a major commodity but the CAP proposals that are due to be published in November by the European Commission will pose a threat to the national envelope of approximately €1.3 billion that Ireland receives.  If there is a reduction in that budget, it could cause challenges for the dairy sector and undermine the policy the Government is seeking to roll out under Food Harvest 2020.The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, is holding its national conference this week and one of the issues it will address is how the dairy sector will prepare for the end of milk quotas.  This will present a challenge for co-operatives in Ireland.  The question is whether the co-operative movement in its current form will be well placed to meet the twofold challenge of the increase in the global population, and the increased demand that goes with it, and the post-milk quota situation.  Will Ireland be able to make the changes necessary to ensure the amount of milk being produced can be increased by the anticipated 50% which is deemed possible under a quota free regime?  Everything we use is home produced and net inputs and outputs are local.  In an increased market for dairy products, there should be a net benefit to the Irish economy as a result.  This will obviously add to growth figures.One of the matters due to be discussed at the ICOS national conference is the cost of preparing for higher milk output.  How will the relationship between farmers, who are shareholders, and their co-operatives continue in the post-quota situation?  What will the nature of that relationship be after 2013 and will farmers be able to embrace the challenge?  I believe they will.  Many people in the dairy sector are vying to gear up for that eventuality, but there is also a generational shift in that regard.  There will have to be a common mechanism to regulate milk production and it must have an all-island approach.  Whether it is an all-island or one Ireland approach is a matter of conjecture but we believe there should be a deepening of the relationship between the two parts of the island to achieve such a common mechanism.There must be a consensus between co-operatives with regard to the potential for the dairy sector and this can only come from the people who own the co-operatives.  It will probably require a change in mindset and a more lateral view as to how we can look at the market strategically.  It has been suggested that Ireland could become another New Zealand or that perhaps Ireland should ally itself with New Zealand to create a type of duopoly to control milk supply from grass-fed cattle.  This is necessary to compete in a global market and we should not be ashamed to look strategically at how that can happen.  There is a critique of the New Zealand model in that land ownership structures are more fluid there than they are here, which facilitates the existence of that model.  Here it is a little more difficult due to the greater ties to the land, but that is a challenge which should be examined.  The key point is that we should take a more lateral view in terms of how to gain a greater foothold in the global dairy market.  If forming strategic alliances is required, we should at least examine the possibilities even if they do not come to fruition.  We must take a more lateral view in forming our strategy.According to Food Harvest 2020, there will be an increase in the global population.  The question for Ireland is how to maximise that potential.  The theory is that the dairy sector must consolidate further and traditional behaviours must be examined with a view to ensuring that we increase our milk supply to cater for that demand.  The success of Food Harvest 2020 will be predicated on ensuring that more young farmers enter the sector.  This should become a priority.  In yesterday's Irish Examiner there was a report by Macra na Feirme indicating that less than 7% of Europe’s farmers are under the age of 35 years.  The Food Harvest 2020 report puts emphasis on giving young people access to farming but the educational aspect of that must be examined more deeply.  If the strategy is to be successful, it must be based on a clear and unambiguous need to provide active measures to ensure participation rates by younger people.There is a suggestion that if there were specific schemes for young people under the new CAP, it would go a long way towards addressing the challenge of ensuring a throughput of new farmers.  The policy would bear fruit arising from that.  Members are familiar with the adage that it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.  If there is a throughput of young farmers, they would be better able to adapt to new methods and will bring forward the policy as necessary.  One of the key deficiencies in the report is the lack of a coherent chapter on education.  It is all well and good to have the targets of increasing the value of the primary output in agriculture, fisheries and forestry by €1.5 billion or 33% compared to the 2007 to 2009 average, increasing the value added in agriculture, food, fisheries and wood products by €3 billion or a 40% increase on 2005 and having an export target of €12 billion for the sector, representing a 42% increase compared to 2007 to 2009, but if that is to be achieved there will have to be a more fundamental educational input for the reasons I have outlined.  Even though innovations are taking place in the beef, dairy and wood sectors, if the age profile of farmers is higher there will be a lag time in reaching those targets.  It will be necessary to increase the throughput of younger people who are educated specifically to achieve those targets.If the overall vision is based on acting smart, thinking green and achieving growth and if the Department is trying to prioritise research and development, improve skill levels, increase best practice, foster creativity and improve consumer preferences, this can only be achieved to a certain extent under the current paradigm.  In other words, the underlying assumptions need to change.  The Labour Party's view is that there has to be a root and branch review of the educational aspects of how to proceed.  We acknowledge that centres of excellence like UCC, which have specialist knowledge food production, should be incorporated into the roll-out of this policy and become active stakeholders.  We also need to overhaul subjects such as agricultural science at second level.  A farming-related model or a food-related model-module of education could be introduced into the leaving certificate curriculum to develop, foster and create the aspirations outlined in the overall vision.  We believe that the younger people start, especially in second level institutions, the more of an opportunity there will be to create the coterie of food and agribusiness entrepreneurs needed to sustain the policy.  If it is a 2020 strategy, it has to be implemented on the basis of ensuring that we start now and we start at second level to ensure more people are brought through the educational system with a focus on food production and all that entails.There are major challenges in the fiscal and economic context.  The report issued by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation under rapporteur, Deputy Arthur Morgan, and Chairman, Deputy Willie Penrose, examined what is required to expand employment in the agrifood sector.  It takes a deep view of what needs to be done and one of the areas it examined is the role of co-operatives.  I referred to the ICOS model and to its meeting this week to discuss how to improve the co-operative movement and the need for greater consolidation.  One of the aspirations in the Morgan report is to ensure an important role for co-operatives.  It states:The Government needs to support the Co-operative enterprise from start-ups to employee buy-outs in the agri food sector. Co-operatives have a long tradition in the agri food sector in Ireland where some businesses, which started out as local co-ops have gone on to be multi-nationals and market leaders such as in the areas of dairy products. The Co-operative Movement has played a central role in the economic development of rural Ireland. Co-operative enterprises create many benefits for business, employees and communities.That aspiration should be incorporated into the strategy.The development of a new generation of co-operatives, particularly for organic foodstuffs, must play a role in creating new jobs in the agrifood sector.  Establishing a co-operative may be the most viable option for starting a new business and government policy needs to reflect this.  The Labour Party will stand over that aspiration and we believe that it needs to be incorporated into a Government policy where one goes back to first principles.  There is a need for greater consolidation within the co-operative movement in the dairy sector where scaling upwards will achieve a greater export market without losing core principles and deepening relationships with the local market.There is massive scope in this area but there is also a role, for instance, for enterprise development agencies to assist in the process of adding value to the industry.  The Morgan report outlines how access to expertise and capital for ventures and projects, which provide economic benefit but which may not happen if left to market forces alone, can be increased.  In other words, State involvement is vital in this process.Improving skill sets is one of the aspirations in the growth and competitiveness chapter of the Food Harvest 2020 document.  It acknowledges the role of Teagasc, the Marine Institute and universities and other third level institutions and states they have a crucial role in creating and disseminating new knowledge.  If one owns an existing business and if one wishes to retrain, there are programmes which are tailored to one's needs.  For instance, a programme in UCC is aimed at people working within the artisan food sector and it is designed to try to encourage them to add value to their products and to learn new business skills.  However, there is a cost component to doing the course and, very often, people working within that sector are operating on tight margins and find it difficult to get funding for courses such as this.If we want to concentrate on education and to try to upskill people or get a more educated coterie working within the food sector, barriers cannot be put in their way.  UCC is oversubscribed for the course it has designed for the artisan food sector.  Some people cannot access the course because they are on marginal incomes within their own food businesses and they cannot afford the fees.  If we are serious about adding value in the sector, it needs to be ensured institutions such as UCC, which provides courses, are not impeded from doing so for want of grant aiding people within the food industry who want to do the courses.  It is a common sense principle and, notwithstanding current economic constraints, they could be provided with interest free loans, for example, but there should be a guarantee that people will not be impeded from upskilling because of the fees.Increasing knowledge is important to add value to output within the sector but despite the wonderful aspirations in the Food Harvest 2020 document, it will fail as a policy if it does not allow for a proper educational component.  Access to courses is vital and if we are to deepen the involvement of entrepreneurs in the agrifood sector, educational establishments should be able to take people in without impediment.  There should not be a barrier to entry to courses.Post-primary school enrolments will also increase significantly to reach 334,500 by 2018.  Traditional subjects such as English, Irish, maths, French and so on remain and there is still not an emphasis on science or agriscience subjects.  The Labour Party believes in the policy but for it to work, the Government needs to deepen the educational tie-in and the only way to do so is to foster a culture of entreprenuerialism in young children at second level and to develop an education model that reflects the fact that we have always been an agricultural country, we have always had strong ties to the land and even though we have become urbanised in our thinking, we are never too far from the land.  The land will get us out of the economic morass but we need to think more laterally about that.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The first part of this report makes the point that while this country has huge advantages in terms of our status as a producer of internationally recognised good food, there is no room for complacency.  Irish agriculture and Irish farmers face considerable challenges over the next number of years, not least from the current review of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is vital, therefore, that we have a coherent approach to the negotiations that will take place and that the outcome which will shape CAP after 2013 protects the interests of Irish farmers.  It is also vital that we have in place a strategy that will ensure that this country is capable of adapting to whatever changes come about as a result of the reform.My party agrees with the vision set out in the report of a dynamic sector capable of achieving sustainable growth.  My colleague, Deputy Arthur Morgan, recently submitted a report, which was adopted by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, on the agrifood sector.  The report addresses many of the issues which are the focus of this report and there are considerable areas of agreement.  However, much of the way in which the agrifood sector develops in the future will depend on the strategy put in place by the Department and that, in large part, will depend on political considerations, although there are considerable areas of agreement on what needs to be done across all parties in the House and within the sector itself.I said the same in regard to the last reform of CAP, which came into effect in 2003.  My party supported decoupling when all other parties in the House sat on the fence, as we and many within the farming sector saw the advantages of a situation where farmers were guaranteed a certain level of income security allied to the opportunity to branch into new areas of production that were not dependent on EU subsidies.I also pointed out at the time that the success or otherwise of the reforms would depend on the strategy in place at domestic level to cope with what were radical changes.  Unfortunately, this has not been properly addressed since 2003.A report, which I submitted to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the future of farming and fishing in the west, which was unanimously adopted by the committee, highlighted the problems faced by farmers in the western counties.  Through an extensive survey it also showed a high level of pessimism on the part of western farmers, even with the advent of the single farm payment.  Many believed that they have no future in farming and this is especially true of smaller scale family farms.  This has been reflected in the continuing haemorrhage of people from the land.  While there are those who would claim that this is a natural process, none of us wishes to see a situation whereby the number of farmers in the country is reduced to well below 100,000 before 2020, as forecast by several studies on farm viability.  Not only would this have detrimental social effects and a massive impact on already disadvantaged and declining rural communities, but it would also have implications for the country's future as a key food producer, especially in the context of the EU and global food security, as referred to in this report.  Therefore, we must have a strategy not only to ensure we have a successful and dynamic food sector, but also that we retain the maximum possible number of people on the land and that family farms survive not as struggling dependants on direct payments, but as viable and dynamic individual farm enterprises tied in with an overall dynamic food sector.Much of the way forward to achieving this has been highlighted in Deputy Morgan's report on the agrifood sector.  We must recognise that food production and processing are the major indigenous economic sectors, as underlined in the Food Harvest 2020 report.  As a result, they are not as dependent on or as subject to volatile international trends as, for example, certain manufacturing sectors in which decisions made far away can have devastating impacts on employment here.  Agrifood is a sector largely in our own hands which produces a product for which there will always be a significant and relatively stable demand.  Indeed, the demand for food, especially for safely produced food, will grow over the longer term.  This has been referred to already in the debate on the CAP reform and it was one of the key issues mentioned by Commissioner Ciolos when he was here some weeks ago to address the agriculture committee.  Unfortunately, other commitments prevented me from attending the committee that day but I have read with interest his remarks, especially those which referred to food security and the need to preserve Europe's capacity to meet demand.The report and all proposals and discussions on the future of the food sector here must be placed in that context.  As the section on future growth illustrates, expanding and developing the food sector has the potential to boost the return to the primary producer, the farmer, boost exports and expand the involvement of small and medium enterprises, hence of employment with all the benefits that brings in terms of the economy in general and living standards.The report sets ambitious growth targets for 2020.  It maintains that the value of primary output in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors can increase by €1.5 billion or 33% compared to the 2007-2009 average.  Likewise, the value added in the agrifood, fisheries and wood products sector can increase by €3 billion or 40% compared to 2008, with exports reaching €12 billion.  If these targets were met they would represent a considerable boost to overall economic growth and provide one of the key engines to bring us out of the current mess.  However, achieving these targets could also be negatively impacted upon by the current policies being implemented within the agricultural sector and society overall.It is clear that future economic growth will not come about through austerity measures, which drive people onto the dole, to poverty and to emigration.  Nor will future economic growth come about through destroying training and research and development.  We have already seen significant cuts in these areas within the agricultural sector.  As Deputy Morgan's report points out, these are key areas if we are to take advantage of the opportunities that undoubtedly exist.Another key area is that of credit and we are all familiar with the problems which small and medium enterprises and farmers have had and are currently experiencing with the banks in terms of accessing the credit necessary to allow them to invest.  Quite simply, if the research and development and the training is not in place and if the capital is not available for investment, then the ambitious targets outlined in this report are not worth the paper they are written on.  In regard to credit, it is ironic that in the survey conducted among enterprises within the agrifood sector by Deputy Morgan, the major reason cited by the lending institutions for refusing to lend was a lack of capital.  For the most part, these were the same lending institutions which handed out money hand over fist to developers and speculators, who were clearly acting on a wing and a prayer or in many cases simply bluffing on the allegedly ever increasing values of property.  However, businesses which employ people and which actually produce goods for which a demand exists and which have viable businesses plans are for the most part refused the credit they need to kick-start or to expand.  Clearly, this is a key area which must be addressed if the agrifood sector is to grow, which it clearly has the potential to do.Food Harvest 2020 addresses the issue of credit and regards the restriction of credit as a key factor inhibiting growth and development.  Among its proposals are that the banks should consider the use of mechanisms such as chattel mortgages and invoice discounting.  However, these are followed by a proposal that the Department ought to consider the use of State supports to the sector with a view to further promoting competitiveness and sustainability.  The report also suggests that the Government should consider the specific needs of the food and beverages sector in its deliberation on an export credit insurance scheme.  Perhaps the emphasis on State support and encouragement suggests that the authors of the report are not overly optimistic regarding a change in the policy of the banks.  However, the effective State control of banking ought to ensure that whichever Government is in power ought to be able to force the banks to change those policies where they are clearly in conflict with the best interests of the overall economy.The report refers to the use of renewable energy sources and this is something that has not been adequately addressed by the current Government despite the involvement of the Green Party.  It has set ambitious targets for the replacement of energy generated by fossil fuels by renewable sources but it has done little to achieve those targets.  Farming is obviously a key focus in all of this given the possibility of having on-farm wind generators and of encouraging farmers to grow energy crops.  My party has also published proposals on the use of the former sugar factories as processors of sugar beet as an input into bio-energy production.Regarding marketing, the report highlights the significant proportion of our food exports that go to other EU states and still, overwhelmingly, to the UK.  Exports to the UK will fall significantly by 2020 according to the report although they may remain at a high level.  Exports to other EU states will rise and the overall level of exports to the EU is forecast to be approximately 75% of total exports.  Exports to North America, Asia and the Middle East will also increase albeit from a relatively low level.In that context and to return to the CAP reform post-2013 it is vital that these markets and, in particular, exports to the rest of the EU are protected from any potential challenge from third countries.  This relates not only to the economic factors related to the Irish food sector and overall economy, but also to the issue of food security, the preservation of which on a domestic and EU level is intimately dependent on food production in the country.  Any major threat to the country's food exports and growth in food exports would completely undermine the targets set in the report for future development and growth of the agrifood sector in general.The reputation of Irish food as clean and healthy is also key and in that context I hope we are not browbeaten or enticed into embracing a policy of allowing genetically modified food to be produced here.  Several studies have demonstrated that EU consumers are hostile to GM food and it would be the height of madness were we to abandon that advantage on the basis of spurious arguments presented by the GM companies and their self-interested spokespersons here.  By retaining the image that Irish food is safely produced we can maintain a clear advantage over our competitors.There is also the issue of the relationship between producers, processors and retailers.  The report notes that future growth must entail a better return for farmers as primary producers.  Over recent years, however, we have witnessed significant pressures on the price paid to farmers, with the percentage of the final consumer price that accrues to farmers steadily falling.That also raises questions of the control farmers have over the processing and marketing aspects of the sector, which many contend relates to the changing nature of the processors that were once run as co-operatives.  Farmers might examine the whole area with a view to returning to the co-operative concept in a modernised form to enable them to secure a better return for their produce.  Co-operatives founded all over this country were undermined when they were transformed into PLCs, which are all about profit at the expense of the producer.On retaining and expanding markets, the report again covers some of the same areas as Deputy Morgan's report.  I note the reference to reducing input costs through greater efficiencies in energy, transport and a reduction in the regulatory burden, which was one of the main areas identified in the Morgan report by people involved in the agrifood sector.  Other key areas are linkages, better marketing techniques and improved research and development.The report deals with issues in the specific sectors of beef, sheepmeat and cereals that I do not have time to address in detail.  The common theme in all sectors appears to be the need to maintain or to improve the quality of the product and to ensure that it is price competitive in respect of rival producers, and in particular other exporters to EU markets.  Regarding cereals, the report recommends greater diversification into other crops and into biomass, all of which have proven markets that could open up for Irish producers.  That needs to be addressed within the context of overall strategy around Ireland's place within the reformed CAP.  Not enough has been done to encourage farmers to take advantage of whatever new production opportunities exist since the introduction of decoupled payments.Towards the end the report deals briefly with the seafood sector.  There is massive potential here, particularly to increase the level of higher value added domestic processing for export.  Unfortunately, seafood is subject to the overall restrictions on a sector which, unlike agriculture, has certainly seen no benefits as a consequence of EU policy.  Quite the opposite.  We are still witnessing the harmful effects of the manner in which the Irish fishery is administered from Brussels to the detriment of Irish fishermen.  The unfair distribution of quota and other restrictions have held back the development of what had and still has the potential to be an area of growth but that will not happen until we secure a meaningful reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to redress the gross imbalance in quota allocation within what ought to be Irish waters.I welcome the opportunity to debate this report and hope that whoever is in government over the coming period will adopt the ambitious targets it sets out and put into place a strategy capable of achieving them.  I do not believe the austerity measures being implemented by the current Government and seemingly also favoured by two of the main Opposition parties are the way forward.  We need imaginative policies that will stimulate domestic growth.  Agrifood is the main indigenous economic sector and one that has the potential for growth even at the present time based on the global demand for food.  We can take advantage of that if we are prepared to encourage development rather than drive the economy further into recession by pursuing the type of policies in place at present.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I thank Deputy Aylward for agreeing to share a few minutes of his time with me.  Last night I spoke on credit for small and medium-sized enterprises during Private Members' business.  I welcome the way we are positioning Ireland to be successful in selling goods and services abroad and the way we are winning global investment and attracting visitors from around the world.  I lauded the Government's approach in its latest integrated trade, tourism and investment plan, which included a number of targets relevant to agriculture.  We want to increase the number of export-focused jobs and the value of exports.  In difficult times our exports are holding up and doing well.  We want to ensure this continues.  We want to diversify into other areas and markets.  This plan will help farmers and firms expand their market share overseas and will boost food exports.  The policies and initiatives are not standalone but part of an integrated Government strategy to get our economy moving in the right direction.  Agriculture is Ireland's most important indigenous industry.  It will play a crucial role in our eventual recovery from the current situation.  It played an important role in the past and the old saying is that when the farmer is happy, everyone is happy.  When the farmer has a good harvest, he gets good yields and payment and money is distributed through the local economy as the farmer pays bills.  It is a major boost to the local economy.Food Harvest 2020 provides the crucial framework for agriculture.  I am a Deputy from a primarily rural Border constituency and agriculture plays a significant role in the local economy.  I welcome the vision for agriculture as outlined in Food Harvest 2020.  I come from a farming background and my husband is a farmer.  I understand the considerable complexities of the agricultural industry, which are recognised in the Food Harvest 2020 report.  The report outlines the key actions needed to ensure the sector contributes to export-led economic recovery and the full development of the smart economy.  These are two areas I have advocated in this Chamber while speaking on other issues.  The report is exhaustive in its targets and recommendations.  I welcome some of the contents.  I welcome that the implementation group will be convened in different formations to allow farmers, co-ops and food companies to contribute to the implementation process.  That is important.The ending of milk quotas in 2015 will give us the opportunity to grow our milk output.  A target of a 50% increase in milk production by 2020 has been set.  We have had significant investment in dairying and we must harness the investment.  In my constituency, the pigmeat sector is important and has contributed approximately €300 million to farm output in 2009.  A target of 50% growth in the value of output in the pig industry is achievable.  Poultry farming is also extensive and is synonymous with my region.  The output value of poultry production is approximately €150 million annually.  The sector is entirely domestically focused.  There are opportunities in the industry to reduce costs and achieve greater efficiency.  If these opportunities are available, there is potential for a 10% increase in the value of poultry.Agriculture will play a significant role in our recovery and while some may say that targets outlined are ambitious, we have the potential to meet targets.  We need a positive, can-do attitude.  I want to see brand Ireland at the heart of our markets.  We must build on our strengths, of which the agrifood sector is one.  It will continue to remain at the forefront of international company competitors.  The targets for smart, green growth can be achieved.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	294	As a farmer and the father of a young farmer, I am enthusiastic about the prospects that Food Harvest 2020 presents for those engaged in farming and the agrifood industry in Ireland.  The exhaustive and detailed report was launched in July.  It is an indepth and provoking document and a report that is vital to underpinning the future of the sector and enhancing the livelihoods of the agricultural community and those involved in the agrifood sector.  Its wise implementation has far-reaching consequences for agricultural activity and the impact which the sector will make on national and international consumer markets.  The report provides a new vision and a valuable, workable framework for concentrated activity in the next ten years in this country in the areas of agrifood, drinks, fisheries and forestry.  This is, without doubt, our single most valuable indigenous industry and it is imperative that we get our future priorities right so that we can achieve sustainable growth, expansion and prosperity for everyone within this vital sector.We can never underestimate the intrinsic worth of agriculture and agrifood to this country nor can we underestimate the great complexity of the sector and the various factors which impinge on its activity and its progress.  I am pleased that the Food Harvest 2020 report reflects the complex nature of the farming and agrifood industry and that it captures the many and varied challenges we face and the opportunities that we can unlock if we are to harness the full potential of the sector in the coming decade.  In particular, Food Harvest 2020 justly recognises the unique and special position which agriculture occupies in this country and its pivotal importance to the Irish economy as a whole.  Prosperity within agriculture is not just particular to those active in the industry but it touches the well-being of the entire economy and the entire nation.I welcome the report because it identifies graphically the enormous potential which exists and it illustrates clearly the vast potential for the sector to grow even further if we adopt the correct approach and apply the various concrete recommendations.  We can all work on this together, Government and private enterprise alike.  We are all stakeholders and all of us have a significant role to play in realising our objectives in a successful way.  I am pleased to hear the Minister say that he will give a meaningful involvement to all stakeholders in the process of implementing the recommendations of Food Harvest 2020.Food Harvest 2020 is the result of considerable expertise and long hours of serious deliberations.  It represents a modern, enlightened strategic vision for the future of Irish agriculture and agrifood.  The blueprint it affords is a compelling one.  The expert committee clearly and firmly believes that these sectors can and will deliver real and tangible returns over time.  The detail of the report demonstrates that Irish agriculture and agrifood can and will be at the vanguard of our economic recovery and our return to much-needed economic growth in as short a period as possible.  That must be the overriding consideration at this time.  In order to achieve that ambition and to translate the aspirations into reality, it is essential that we make the proper and informed decisions now without unnecessary delay.  The 2020 report is comprehensive and insightful.  It stands as a realistic and pragmatic roadmap which we can follow if we are to develop and prosper successfully within these essential sectors.The report underscores some of the challenges which confront us on the road to future growth and prosperity but, more importantly, it illustrates exactly how we can set about achieving the goals and targets we are setting ourselves.  We must be absolutely confident, convinced and sincerely committed to our aims.  The committee has said that Ireland can grow its exports of food and beverages by one third to achieve a value of €12 billion every year.  It believes we can increase the value of primary production by farmers and fishermen by €1.5 billion and that value added through processing can be increased by €3 billion.  These are substantial figures but they are realistic and attainable with the right attitude and measures.When milk quotas come to an end in 2015, we have a golden opportunity which we can seize to increase milk output by an estimated 50%, which is the equivalent of 2.75 billion litres of milk.  That could improve primary output value by €700 million with substantial additional increases downstream.  Relative to our competitors, we have to improve our cost competitiveness by 20%.There is a renewed acceptance that the agribusiness industry is crucial to Ireland's economy, not just in terms of employment and trade but also as a catalyst for investment and growth.  The sector as a whole has an annual output of a staggering €24 billion.  The agrifood industry overall accounts for more than 163,000 jobs in the country or 8.2% of total employment.  It accounts for approximately 8% of GDP and is worth almost 10% of exports with a total value of approximately €9.2 billion.  We rely heavily on exports which absorb more than 80% of dairy and beef output.  The value of Irish meat and livestock exports reaches almost €2.5 billion, underlining that the meat sector is a significant element in our economy.Food Harvest 2020 is an inspired first step towards progress over the next ten years.  I encourage farmers and the industry alike to study the document, reflect on its ambitious objectives and embrace the spirit and the letter of the recommendations in full.  I accept there are significant challenges ahead and that there will be obstacles.  However, this report identifies those challenges and it provides us with the essential equipment to anticipate the obstacles and to enable us to surmount them in an intelligent and forward-thinking fashion.  I welcome this intelligent and inspiring report.  I look forward to seeing the fruits of our dedication and collective national efforts over the next ten years.  I know it will be well worth it.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on agriculture.  It is my first time to speak on the subject since I moved from the transport area.  After the news of recent days it is a pleasure to talk about agriculture which depends on two things, namely, weather and a good price.  In the past four to five years the farming community and those employed on farms got neither.  It has been a good year for farming weather-wise, whether one is involved in dairy, beef or tillage.I come from a rural area.  I was a dairy farmer from the age of 14 to 47.  This is the first time an upbeat feeling has been evident in the farming community when farmers call into a shop or pub for a drink.  Money is there now.  We will have to start again in the way we did when we joined the European Community in the early 1970s.  We must start at the bottom.  Five or six years ago when the economy was flying one could not get a person to drive a tractor or milk a cow.  Small farmers in the area of north Meath where I come from and over the border into Cavan locked up their slatted units and went to work on the buildings.  They have moved back now.The best saying I have heard is from a friend of mine, namely, there is great money in farming if it were not for the bills.  That was always the case.  In the past three years the bills were not paid.  There is a great opportunity given the good price for tillage and that some crops have been bought forward for next year.  The dairy and beef sectors have also held their own.  I advise the Minister that under no circumstances should the budget affect anyone in the agrisector.  Although people in the sector have had a good year, they have waited for the past two years for that money, be it the person who sold the seed or the fertiliser.  I urge the Minister, and Deputy Aylward and his colleagues, not to jeopardise the one industry that is beginning to create employment.Last week I sent in a request to extend the slurry spreading season.  There was a certain amount of uproar at home because a couple of contractors in my area and the men who work for them said they had another two weeks worth of work.  We must start afresh and examine all aspects of farming.  It is necessary to re-examine the prohibition on the spreading of slurry from October to January.Food is what it is all about.  The world's population is growing.  In the past 25 to 30 years this country has been forced into producing the best food in the world.  At times, we as farmers did not like the regulations and having the Department coming in on top of one but that is the regime in place and we are used to it.  The ending of milk quotas presents a significant opportunity.  Milk herds are worth much more now because other countries that got out of the industry are now buying stock from this country.  I recall that when we first joined the European Union the man who worked on our farm got £7 a week.  Almost within the space of six or eight months his wages went to £70.  We started to buy luxury goods such as cheese from Holland.There is an opening in eastern Europe for our products.  Deputy Johnny Brady is present in the Chamber.  There is an opportunity to bring in Bord Bia and for those we trust to sell our products abroad to put a programme before us for the next four years.  Irish food has a great name everywhere.  If there is an increase of €1 billion in sales this year compared to last year, that is just the start.  Quotas are being abolished and the dairy herd will be allowed to produce more milk, and the fact that quality of beef determines the price paid for an animal is starting to work in our favour because the quality of animals in our fields is far higher than even ten years ago.The weather has been favourable this year.  If the weather had not held out, farming would have been gone but it stayed fine, quality was good and farmers are being paid.  As a result, their suppliers are being paid and the small shops and retailers are being paid.  We must, however, be ruthless in protecting the price paid to the food producer.  We had a habit of squeezing the farmer to the limit, allowing him to earn a bare week's wages.  If a farmer gets an extra €10,000, he will not spend it on a new kitchen or a new car, he will spend it upgrading his farm.  That is why it is crucial that farming should be left alone in the budget.  It should be left as it was.  Payments are being graded out and it cannot be done overnight.Sheep farmers had a rough year, even though there are great prices, because thousands of lambs were lost in the early spring because of abortion.  This must be highlighted, perhaps up to €2 million in exports was lost because of that.  In my area one farmer lost his entire flock of lambs and half of his sheep died, 100 lambs at €100 each, a loss of €10,000.The agricultural organisations, the Oireachtas committee and Bord Bia must be strong and let things get back to previous levels.  Farmers were not well paid when the economy was flying but people will now milk a cow, lift the eggs and look after sheep and that is where we must start.  A farmer runs more than a farm, he runs a business and he must account for every cent spent.  If a farmer has a turnover of €200,000, it is the same as a shop in the parish and he must be looked after.I urge the sale of Irish food.  I have been on one trip since I was elected, to Kiev in the Ukraine.  It is not in the EU but those countries are now in the same position as we were 30 years ago.  It is a fantastic nation that wants educated people but those people have never been able to buy luxuries.  All of those countries now are coming out of recession quicker than us.  We must be ready when the quota system is abolished and people want to buy luxury food, because be it poultry, pigmeat or beef, we have it.  We have the units for hens, pigs, beef, dairy and sheep and thankfully our tillage men got a great opening this year.  Now is the time to bring in those selling our products and give them this responsibility.  The hard work that has been done in the industry to overcome bad weather and bureaucracy has paid off and no one can point the finger at us about the quality of our food.  We had a slight blip in the pig industry but it was sorted out quickly and has since picked up.Deputy Johnny Brady knows farming much better than me, and Deputy Sargent is interested in vegetable growing; we should all get together and get those we depend on to sell our products to do their jobs and promote Irish food.  The economy will recover and agriculture is the sector that will lead the way.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The agrifood industry is ideally placed to play a very significant role in this country's economic recovery.  The sector directly employs more than 150,000 people and its economic benefit is felt throughout the country.  With the economy relying on an export-led recovery, the agrifood sector continues to generate exports of goods worth up to €8 billion to more than 160 countries around the world annually.  As the Taoiseach said on the occasion of the launch of the Food Harvest 2020 report, this country's future economic growth will be driven by the export of goods and services, stimulating activity and employment throughout the rest of the economy.  The agrifood sector is "the embodiment of the type of export-led recovery which the Government is pursuing."Food Harvest 2020 provides the agrifood sector with a blueprint for the next decade and captures the considerable complexity of the sector.  It underlines its unique and special position within the Irish economy and it illustrates the potential which exists for this sector to grow even further.With more than 200 recommendations, the Food Harvest 2020 report is very detailed.  The Oireachtas committee is convinced that the agrifood sector can deliver real returns and be at the forefront of this country's economic recovery.  The report shows that Ireland can grow its exports of food and beverages by one third to €12 billion annually, while also increasing the value of primary production by our farmers and fishermen by €1.5 billion and value added in processing by €3 billion.  These are ambitious and challenging targets but they are also achievable.The broad welcome to the report is indicative of a confident and ambitious sector which wants to move forward and harness the full potential which will undoubtedly arise from the inevitable increase in demand for food following surging global population growth.  In 1999, the world's population crossed the 6 billion threshold for the first time; in 2012, it will reach 7 billion and by 2015, 8 billion.  At the same time, in some of the world's most populous countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, economic development is creating new consumer audiences who demand new and diverse food solutions.Substantial investment in agriculture, marine and food research over the past decade, including record levels of Government investment, has allowed Irish producers and food companies to build up wide-ranging expertise, particularly in the key dairy and beef sectors.  The vitality of those sectors is demonstrated by the fact that Ireland exports 85% of dairy products and more than 90% of beef production.  Through investment and innovation, meat and dairy, our traditional export sectors, have been strengthened and safeguarded.The aim now must be to build on the success of the past and to meet the competitive challenge of the international marketplace.  The agrifood industry has real strength and real opportunities and the challenge is to build on its knowledge and capability so that it remains at the forefront of our international competitors.  The Food Harvest 2020 report provides a road map to guide the agrifood sector and inform its development, particularly one so central to the Irish economy.The 2020 committee has set out a vision based on smart, green growth.  There is a renewed interest in the agrifood sector among the wider society and a growing recognition of the role it can play in our economic recovery.  Food Harvest 2020 sets a number of challenging targets across all the individual sectors, from beef to dairy, horticulture to organics and seafood to forestry and bio-energy crops.  The challenges and the opportunities vary from sector to sector, but each has its contribution to make to the development and growth of the wider Irish agrifood sector.We are all aware of the impending abolition of EU milk quotas in 2015 and the 2020 committee has made a series of recommendations which, if acted on, have the potential to deliver a 50% increase in milk production, which would enhance the primary output value of the sector by about €700 million.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, has already acted on one of those key recommendations by establishing a dairy expansion activation group.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	298	This small group is composed of farmers, processors and Teagasc, is chaired by Dr. Sean Brady and will address specific actions to be taken to realise the targets for dairy expansion set out in the report.  The report also targets a growth of 20% in the output value of the beef sector by 2020 and makes a series of recommendations to ensure the sector's potential is realised.  Irish beef and livestock production makes an important contribution to the overall economy, with a current annual output value of some €1.9 billion.Some of the other ambitious targets identified in the report include a growth in output value of 20% in the sheep sector, 50% growth in the value of output in the pigmeat sector, a potential increase of 10% in the value of poultry output and increased revenue to €1 billion and employment to 14,000 full-time equivalent jobs in sea fisheries and aquaculture.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an Food Harvest 2020.  Given the figures, there is no doubt that agriculture is key to our future, in particular our economic recovery.  The increase of 8% in food and drink exports in the first half of the year compared with last year highlights this fact in the face of recessionary talk.  The figures stand for themselves, but it is not enough to dwell on the 150,000 jobs or the €24 billion output.  We need to consider the trends and recognise that, within the figures, people are losing out because of market pressures that are squeezing farmers out of business.  I am familiar with some cases of this.The 2020 report's template is good, as it focuses on smart green growth, as the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, mentioned.  I agree with the Minister, Deputy Smith, in that we sell our food and drink as coming from a clean, green food island, but we must not allow the green wash talk to stand without rigorous verification to ensure our product comes from the highest environmental standards.  For this reason, Food Harvest 2020 is not enough and we need to go beyond what it details.  For example, it refers to dependence on the family farm and the family farm being critical, but many family farms are under pressure and quite a number of families have left farming because of the economies of scale.  People in the horticulture sector with whom I am familiar in north County Dublin, County Wexford and many other areas where horticulture is important have left.  So much for defending the family farm.Not the Government, but the multiples and factories are calling the shots.  I agree with the report, in that we need more producer groups, but this will not tackle the issue while the rampant discounting of fresh produce is allowed to gather momentum and to devalue the work that goes into producing the best fruit and vegetables in horticulture and all other agriculture sectors.  The same goes for the meat and dairy sectors, although milk has had a bit of a bounce this year and I hope that will continue.Horticulture is being killed off by the discounting of fresh produce.  I attended the opening of an extension by the Dublin/Meath Growers Society, but the rug was pulled from under the society by a large multiple.  Groomes Fresh Produce faced similar problems last week, but Total Produce has come in to save those jobs, luckily enough.  This is the pressure in question.  Across the water in the UK, as few as three growers, a couple of which are losing money, operate on the same acreage that grows horticulture in Ireland.  I do not want to stand over a situation in which we are reduced to three people in horticulture.  It is hardly plural.To this extent, the House must send the clear message that the discounting of fresh produce by the multiples is tantamount to treachery and treason because it causes the seeds of the demise of our horticulture industry to be sown.  It also comes down to us to go beyond the 2020 report and to call for direct routes to markets and ways for farmers to earn a living that do not put them in hock, essentially in bondage, to the multiples.  Where it is not working out for farmers, they need options.  Currently, they can find none and this is the only show in town.  All options — selling directly to hotels, farm shops and farmers markets, engaging in product development, changing their ways and going organic — need to be set out.  Where getting new business opportunities up and running is concerned, farmers markets are as important in every town as the county enterprise board.The 2020 report does not mention them, but the opportunities for Ireland in terms of GM-free foods also need to be recognised.  Some 60-70% of European consumers want GM-free produce.  It is available for sale, but the Irish Grain and Feed Association must guarantee to supply it.  This is what patriotism is about.  We play to our strengths and sell internationally.  We are an exporting country, but we need to be able to export what consumers want.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Tá áthas orm freisin cúpla focal a rá ar an páipéir Food Harvest 2020.  "It is an ill wind that does not blow some good" is an old saying in the country.  In this instance, the good blown by the economic crisis is that it has returned agricultural production to its key role.  It is important to the Irish, European and global economies.  The ongoing CAP reform presents another opportunity.  In the process of the reform, we must be mindful of the importance of food production and food security in Ireland, Europe and the world.I welcome the document as published and its targets.  It returns agriculture to an important role.  Some of its targets are to increase the primary output of agriculture, fisheries and forestry by €1.5 billion, a 33% increase on the 2007-09 period, and increase the value added output of agricultural food, fisheries and woodland products by €3 billion, representing a 40% increase on the 2007-09 period.  It also sets an export target of €12 billion for the sector, a 42% increase on the 2007-09 period.Other parts of the document bring challenges to mind.  Last year, the value of Irish food and drink exports declined by 12%, just under €1 billion, to €7.12 billion.  Setting targets for increased production in the years up to 2020 in a year in which exports declined means the increase will not be easily achieved.  Targets must be reached and much work must be done.  However, the outlook is positive.  Given world population trends, a population expansion of 40% has been forecasted.  As such, food production must increase by 40% by 2030 and by 70% by 2050.  Combined with this are other opportunities, such as the production of agricultural crops for the alternative fuel and bio-energy sectors and for the production of electricity through anaerobic digestion.  There are huge, wonderful and challenging opportunities for the agricultural community in the years ahead to 2020 and this document helps to focus on that.  We must also strike a warning, however, when we speak on food security and food scarcity.  The land to be made available for alternative energy crops poses a risk to food security and production.  There is an important balance to be achieved in that respect which will require new awareness and a new ability on the part of legislators and Government as we move into the future.When we set those challenges and look at the opportunities we must be very mindful of what has happened in the past and how we will protect agricultural Ireland and, in particular, the 128,000 holdings in the country.  We see some of the mistakes that happened and the difficulties that exist and must get our own house in order.  I give the example of economic pressure on farming at present and the single farm payment for which the date has come and gone leaving many people unpaid.  There is the disadvantaged area scheme for which many farmers have not been paid yet.  These are farmers who have entered into obligations with their bankers and creditors and with co-ops.  We must be more professional and deliver those payments on the agreed date, in full and on time.  To give the digitisation of maps as a reason for delays is simply not good enough.  It is unprofessional and a bad way of running our business.  These payments should have been made correctly since the previous payments of last year and should have been paid throughout the spring and summer.  It should not be left until farmers are about to be paid.  Serious questions hang over that.I refer to the farm waste management scheme which the Government cut in order to achieve savings.  It was not included in the McCarthy report because the cuts were made prior to that report.  The Government also closed the REPS 4 environmental programme and replaced it with an agri-environmental option scheme, AEOS, after some delay.  That will save €20 million this year.  We all welcome savings but not at the expense of driving farmers off the land.The nitrates directive is a very important part of the CAP negotiations but when left to our Government to implement it we are sadly lacking.  This week is a prime example.  Farmers cannot spread slurry this week in Ireland but in Northern Ireland they can do so.  This is one of the best weeks we have had this year but we cannot go out and spread slurry.  When 2 January comes, however, farmers can go out and spread away even if it is spilling rain, or there is a foot of snow on the ground or a flood forecast.  We must look at the calendar farming issue.  We should be driven by environmental and weather factors not by calendar dates.  This is another area in which we need to improve.The future of industry is its youth, the young people, the farmers of tomorrow.  We must look at the farm gate schemes which were slashed by the Minister in recent years.  I refer to the installation and farm retirement schemes, the disadvantaged area scheme and rural environment protection schemes, REPS, all of which were slashed.  This poses a serious question concerning the good of agriculture.  We must examine that.  If we are to achieve our targets for 2020 we need to look at some of the mistakes and awful things we have done to farming in the past.This expert group and Teagasc must become more proactive in finding solutions to some of the problems I mentioned, namely, agriculture-related problems and the issues that are reducing farm productivity, production and output.  The malting barley and feeding barley sector depend on Teagasc or the experts to come up with a way in which increased nitrogen levels can be used to increase production.  We need that increased production if we are to become competitive with our rivals, especially those in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  We also need to look again at restrictions in regard to the calendar months.  Look at the restrictions in winter ploughing and green cover, for example.  It is crazy that there are times of the year when one cannot plough although the weather is ideal for ploughing or drilling.  If the weather turns bad and ploughing is not feasible people desperately try to do it and get in crops in order to reach deadlines.  I would like the Minister of State to explain that to me.  People living in the North of Ireland can spread slurry but if one lives one field on the other side of the Border one is in trouble as it is illegal to spread it.  One could end up in jail, never mind losing the farm payments which are so vital to Ireland and the farming community.On the positive side, one can look at the targets for protection which must send a signal of confidence and give hope to farmers.  One can take the point of view that food harvesting targets for 2020 give a 50% increase in output for dairy, a 20% increase in beef production and 50% in pig production.  Those are massive figures which give hope and confidence.  However, if we do not have young people coming into agriculture serious questions are posed.I intended to mention organic farming and other points but do not have enough time.  I shall finish on the subject of bureaucracy and red tape.  The report advocates reducing the burden of red tape on business and lays major emphasis on competitiveness.  Three years after promising to reduce unnecessary costs of business compliance by €500 million, only 4% of this promise has been achieved by the Government.  That is in the report.  Agrifood business has been strangled by duplication and overlapping of compliance measures which need to be addressed urgently.  My fear is that although this is a great report the Government has neither the confidence nor the ability to drive it and achieve its aims.

#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I thank the Deputies who spoke for their engagement with Food Harvest 2020, which we must all agree is critically important to the future of the agrifood sector.  I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and others today on the potential of the agriculture, food, fishing and forestry sector.  This remains Ireland's most important manufacturing sector, accounting for over 6% of GDP and approximately 7% of national employment.  This sector is the primary outlet for the produce and output of the country's 128,000 family farms and includes approximately 650 food and drinks firms with a wide geographic spread throughout the country.  We hear much these days about stimulus.  There is broad agreement across the House that the agriculture sector is in itself a stimulus for the economy.  One must recognise that as the report does.The transformation which this multi-million euro export industry has undergone during the past decade has been quite remarkable.  Consider that in the early 1990s the sector was largely commodity based and underpinned by market support mechanisms but today it is a market led and more consumer-focused industry adept at capturing market share for value added produce.  Of particular note has been the development of the sophisticated prepared food industry, including seafood, whose exports are valued at over €1 billion and for which the UK remains our largest market.  Furthermore, and very importantly, the overall sector is estimated to account for approximately one third of the net flow of funds from primary and manufacturing industries due to the high proportion of indigenous raw material and services used and the low net profit repatriation.I was struck by the positive attitude from rural families at the recent ploughing championships.  There is also a renewed and growing recognition in the wider community of the role that agriculture, fishing and forestry can play in our economic recovery.  After a few very difficult years, the immediate outlook for the agrifood sector is improving, with estimates of a €300 million increase in farm output compared to 2009.  I realise there is considerable concern in regard to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and to the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  The Minister and I are working extremely hard with our MEPs to make and state the Irish case at European level, for and on behalf of the Irish agricultural sector.  The value of exports during the first five months of 2010 was almost €3 billion, more than 8% higher than a year earlier.  The rate of recovery has accelerated as the year has progressed, with exports in May some 23% ahead of the same month in 2009.  This is good news for farmers, their families and the whole rural economy and gives a positive but realistic platform to think about the future of the sector.Indeed, my late father always famously said that when the farmer had money, everybody had money, because the farmer spent it.

#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I was surprised to hear Deputy McEntee say the farmer kept the car.  In our experience he bought the new car, the new tractor etc.  The money trickled down.I should like to address in particular forestry and fishery aspects of Food Harvest 2020 and give an indication as to how I see these sectors contributing to the overall growth targets.  In the forestry sector I am delighted to announce the roll-out of the autumn planting programme, 1,000 hectares, which I have instructed my officials to allocate today.  That is good news for the forestry sector, particularly in the autumn planting season.  That is coming on the back of the extra 6,000 hectares planted already this year.  This takes us to a total of 7,500 hectares which it looks as if we will plant for 2010.  The sector is currently playing a very important role in Ireland's economic recovery, especially in the export market.  It is contributing to the ongoing development of an indigenous and renewable energy source.  Enormous expertise has been built up in the sector and I have been delighted over my recent months in this position to get to know many of the people working in the industry, from the nursery workers to the foresters, and indeed the companies involved in thinning, as well as those involved in the new biomass industries that are starting to appear.I was very struck by the number of small businesses I encountered at the ploughing championships.  These were small companies of between four and eight people employing people in a whole new sector.  I wish them well and continued success and hope this sector will continue to grow.  The current upturn in timber prices is a welcome boost to the sector and the forestry owners already committed to forestry.  The prices remain buoyant and the saw-milling sector is working extremely hard to increase its share of the export markets through innovation, competitiveness and co-operation, all the key principles in Food Harvest 2020.Later this evening I shall be in Deputy Doyle's constituency in Wicklow where we are announcing the RDS forest awards, and I hope to see him there.  Again, it is in recognition of the hard work being put in by people within the sector.On the specific recommendations in Food Harvest 2020, my Department was involved in the formation of a number of the producer groups and continues to facilitate these groups, which are now supporting farm forestry owners in achieving economies of scale and to develop sustainable markets.  Teagasc also provides key guidance and knowledge in this matter and it is crucial for the processing sector and the renewable energy sector that this resource is mobilised.Another significant return from the State's investment in forestry, some €1.25 billion since 2000, reflects the crucial role our forests play in combating climate change.  Over the five year period 2008-12 the Kyoto-eligible forests — planted since 1990 — will sequester an estimated 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and this has a net value of €165 million, assuming a carbon credit price of €15 per tonne of CO2.  By 2020 Ireland’s Kyoto-eligible forest could be sequestering up to 4 million tonnes of CO2 per annum.  This is a significant contribution towards achieving Ireland’s Kyoto climate change commitments.  Timber is a sustainable, renewable, carbon-neutral source of energy and plays a key role in the displacement of imported fossil fuels.  This in itself also helps to address environmental issues.My Department is also contributing towards the development of the forestry sector through its investment in forestry research, development and promotion, all key components of the approach recommended in Food Harvest 2020.  There are currently three reviews on forestry issues under way in my Department: a review of the national forestry policy, a review on the grants scheme and a review of Coillte.  The recommendations from these reviews will assist me in developing a strategy for the future.  The recommendations in Food Harvest 2020 will also provide a useful framework from which to maximise returns from forestry in the decade ahead.Turning to the seafood sector, this is an area I have been able to visit in the last couple of months.  Our six fishery harbours have enabled me to meet the wide variation of industry representatives, and I have garnered a new respect for those people who work extremely hard under very difficult circumstances in this sector.  However, we must acknowledge that enormous work has been carried out and we can see the improvements right around the coastline, from Killybegs to Castletownbere, Rossaveal and Dunmore East.  Recently I was in Howth and my last harbour to visit will be Dingle, which I hope to do in the coming weeks.I have been surprised by the amount of investment we have seen there.  I am talking about hundreds of millions of euro and there is infrastructure now in place that will last for many generations.  Perhaps RTE might do a "Prime Time Special" on the work that has been carried out on all these harbours and piers, because it is something of which many people are not aware.  To see the level of expertise and the development that has taken place is somewhat astonishing.I have also been in the happy position in recent times to announce there will be €900,000 for small harbours and piers around the country.  Again, that is something that will boost the harbours around the country in terms of our inshore fishermen, in particular, as well as marine tourism.  This latter is becoming more important in our fishery harbours and we are working closely on this in terms of the tourism aspects.The prospects for the seafood sector at both global and European levels are very favourable, especially in the medium to long term.  It is estimated an additional 30 million tonnes of seafood will be needed by 2030 to meet the food demands of the growing world population.  This increased demand offers great potential and opportunities for Irish seafood companies.In tandem with this growing consumer demand there is increasing focus, particularly within Europe, on sustainable production and seafood maintenance, biodiversity and avoidance of damage to the marine environment.I am acutely aware of the difficulties within the aquaculture sector and am working extremely hard with my officials in this regard.  Indeed, I sit on the marine co-ordination group set up by An Taoiseach, which is trying to break down the barriers and address the issues of concern we have with the European Parliament in relation to restrictions on mature sites and having the appropriate assessments in place to allow our aquaculture industry to develop and grow.  Much of this work is at an advanced stage and I am focusing hard to ensure we break down these barriers to get the industry back up and running and to ensure we have the cleanest waters possible right around the coast and with the best and highest quality seafood we can deliver into a market in which we know we have enormous potential to grow and to create jobs.These factors were highlighted in Food Harvest 2020, which included 15 specific recommendations on seafood designed to capitalise on the growing economic opportunities available for growing this high-value, labour intensive and rural orientated sector.  At EU level our dependence on imported seafood is quite alarming.  More than 65% of seafood consumed in Europe is imported.  This clearly presents opportunities for Ireland to develop its seafood sector, with an emphasis on the EU market.  Currently, around 85% of our seafood is delivered in basic fish format without maximising added value.  This commodity approach leaves us in a position of very much undifferentiated price takes, dependent on buyers who can move their purchases easily.  It is essential that our seafood products are processed, developed, packaged and marketed to realise more reliable markets and better prices.BIM has made considerable progress in assisting the seafood sector in being more innovative.  Since its launch in 2009 in excess of 60 companies have used the innovation facility at its seafood development centre in Cork.  This means the facility is well on its way to delivering its ambitious target of €100 million in additional value added sales over the next five years.  We really believe this target is achievable and we even hope to exceed it.This Government continues to provide financial assistance to the seafood sector through the Irish national seafood programme, which I launched with the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, in July this year.  This programme provides Exchequer-funded support to the seafood sector to develop new products and processes, innovate, add value to products, maintain and improve environmental and food quality standards and improve our cost efficiency.  On 24 September I announced grants totalling €1.75 million to 15 seafood companies under the programme for investment projects, worth €6 million.  This again was to protect jobs and increase potential for further employment within the sector.In these economically troubled times this financial support represents a significant vote of confidence by Government in the potential of the seafood sector.  Together with the Minister, Deputy Smith, I also launched the BIM strategy 2010-12, Delivering on the Potential of Irish Seafood, in July this year.  This three year strategy will be delivered by BIM.  Its shorter timeframe and targets are designed to contribute to the achievement of the targets in Food Harvest 2020, and the level of progress achieved will be a valuable marker of the efficiency of the actions being taken under that report's recommendations.  Again, this strategy aims to create 600 additional jobs across the Irish seafood sector, develop an additional €15 million in value added seafood sales, differentiate 40,000 tonnes of seafood, worth approximately €120 million as eco-levelled and of Irish origin, increase aquaculture capacity by approximately 10,000 metric tonnes — worth an estimated €18 million in new sales — and deliver 3,500 training places to the seafood sector in more than 30 coastal locations annually.Some reservations have been expressed today about the implementation process, and I will deal with that point.  Let us take the recently announced dairy expansion group as an example, although the work we are doing in the aquaculture sector is also relevant.  There is a clear need to take immediate and commercially sensitive decisions to make sure that we expand production and that we have sufficient and competitive processing capacity.  With that in mind, the Minister, Deputy Smith, set up the dairy expansion group, with representatives from Teagasc, which has expertise in maximising output; farmers, who are able practitioners and are best placed to assess the advice given and use it to increase production; and industry CEOs, the key movers in ensuring streamlined and competitive processing capacity.  In November, this group will report back to the high-level committee chaired by the Minister with its decisions.  The Deputies can see that we are making progress in this sector.This is a focused action group representing the key actors along the food chain.  The members' task is to work collaboratively and constructively and arrive at the necessary decisions within a short timeframe.  This type of cohesive and directed action group is one important way to achieve the desired buy-in by participants to ensure that the outcomes envisaged in Food Harvest 2020 are achieved.

#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	310	Following on from my meeting of 16 September, my Department has collaborated with each of the agencies that have a role in the implementation of Food Harvest 2020.  As a result, responsibilities have been allocated for recommendations, and lead and contributory roles have been identified for cross-cutting issues that require collaboration.  A major concern for me is to ensure a joined-up State response that will build upon the momentum of the publication of Food Harvest 2020 and that the priorities of implementation are identified and agreement reached on how the major issues are to be dealt with.  It is important that we act on this report and that it does not end up sitting on a shelf.  That is what everyone in the Chamber and, indeed, in the industry, wants to see.I thank all Deputies for their suggestions and their active engagement with this important debate.  It is obvious that there is great loyalty towards this sector in the House, as well as an interest in ensuring that this indigenous sector flourishes.  Much hard work has already been done to get us to this stage, and this is continuing.  The Minister and I look forward to the continued co-operation and support of Deputies as we work to support and develop this sector in the difficult economic times that lie ahead.  I am sorry for running over time, but this is such an important sector that we must take the opportunity to give a comprehensive report when we can.  This sector will be one of the main contributors towards ending our economic difficulties.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	311	The current governance proposals arise from a resolution passed in November 2007, by the council of delegates of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  The resolution urged all national societies, as requested by action 3 of the strategy for the movement, to examine and update their statutes, their rules and related legal texts by 2010, in accordance with the Guidance for National Society Statutes and relevant international conference resolutions.  This task is being undertaken by many Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world.The formal report of the working group established by the Irish Red Cross Society to examine the issue of governance was received in the Department of Defence in January of this year.  In order to implement the recommendations made, significant amendments to the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939 will be required.  The 1939 order, which was made pursuant to the Red Cross Act 1938 provides for the current governance arrangements of the society.Representatives of the society and officials from the Department of Defence have had a number of meetings to discuss the specific changes required to the 1939 order and work is ongoing in that regard.  Officials from the Department have also met officials in the Office of the Attorney General to discuss the changes that need to be made.  The rules of the society, as provided for in the 1939 order, will also need to be amended by the society to reflect the proposed governance changes.  As of now it is not possible to give a precise timetable for the implementation of the required changes; however, this work is being prioritised in the Department and good progress is being made.The recent appointment, by the President, of Mr. David O'Callaghan as chairman of the society is also a positive development.  Mr. O'Callaghan is a former career civil servant with experience of matters relating to the Irish Red Cross Society from his time as Secretary General of the Department of Defence.  I am fully confident that his appointment will help expedite the reform process under way in the society.  The post of secretary general of the society, which is currently filled on an acting basis, was recently advertised and I expect that the society will be in a position to fill the post in the near future.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I thank the Minister for his response.  Does he agree that the Irish Red Cross Society is a very important organisation both nationally and internationally?  It is used here for emergency planning and other purposes, and is an auxiliary to the State.  Does he also agree that it should get the greatest of attention from the Minister?  What is the delay in implementing the 20 Government proposals?  Has the Minister read these proposals and what are his views on them?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I agree that the Irish Red Cross Society is a very important organisation.  It is important to remember that the governance of the society is set out under the terms of the Geneva Convention, the 1938 Act and the 1939 order.  One of the principal requirements of the Minister is to ensure the independence of the Irish Red Cross Society.  That provision is not necessarily put in place because of the requirements relating to the Red Cross in Ireland but because the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies operate internationally, sometimes in very difficult circumstances, and their neutrality and independence from government is a very important consideration in that context.  It would be disastrous for the Government to undermine the independence of the Irish Red Cross Society by intervening in the day-to-day running of the organisation and the Government would not countenance doing so.Further to the proposals arising from the 2007 review of the international societies, the working group set up here made a number of recommendations, which we have discussed here on previous occasions, including that the chairman of the Irish Red Cross Society should be independently appointed when the new system is in place, that the number of Government nominees should be dramatically reduced and many other recommendations on the internal workings of the organisation.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	314	The Minister has not answered my question on why it is taking so long to reach a decision on these proposed reforms.  Is it not true that the Department received these proposals in January and ten months later the Minister has not taken much action on them?  Is it not time that action was taken?  Far from intervening or interfering, as the Minister said, this is supporting and is something the Irish Red Cross Society itself seeks.  Is it not true that it is the Minister who is delaying change, reform and progress on this matter, which will lead to the Irish Red Cross Society being open to all kinds of bad press which does not help its thousands of volunteers who do considerable good work, including some of its members who go overseas and put their lives at risk?  Is it not about time for the Minister to make a decision that would support and help the Irish Red Cross Society by taking decisions on these reforms?  Is it not the Minister's responsibility to introduce changes to the 1939 order?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Of course after the report of the task force was received a number of steps needed to be undertaken, not least of which was consultation with the international Red Cross with regard to whether the working group proposals were appropriate in the context of the changes the international Red Cross had sought in 2007.  There was considerable consultation at that level.  There was also consideration of the proposals at the level of the executive of the Irish Red Cross Society, which was a very important element of that.  There was not a large queue of people seeking to be appointed to the position of chairman of the society and I am very grateful to Mr. O'Callaghan for having accepted it.  At this point he and his executive have considerable work to do independently of the Government.  Some of these changes are quite far-reaching, and some elements need to be cleared by the Office of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel regarding the manner in which they are done.  I would welcome input from the Houses of the Oireachtas and I would be happy to bring the draft regulations before the relevant committee at the appropriate time if that were the feeling of the House in that regard.This is a major restructuring and it is more important that it be done properly than done with undue haste and end up being a failure.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	316	Does the Minister believe it can be done in the next 12 months?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I agree with the Deputy on the role of the volunteers in the Irish Red Cross Society and the wonderful work they do as well as the impact of the Red Cross internationally.  As previously discussed in the Chamber, it would have been impossible to advance all this in the absence of a chairman being in position to lead the executive as considerable work needs to be done there.  I assure the House there will be no untoward delays in moving it on.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	318	Lariam is authorised for use by the Irish Medicines Board which is the statutory regulatory body charged with regulating the use of medicines, to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines available in Ireland.  Lariam was first authorised for use by the Irish Medicines Board in 1989.  The authorised product information provides details to ensure the safe and effective use of this medicinal product.  While certain risks associated with the use of the drug were highlighted in the Drug Safety Newsletter in 1996 and 2003, the Irish Medicines Board remained of the view that the benefit-risk profile for the product remained acceptable.  The IMB continues to review the safety of this and all medicines on an ongoing basis and updates the product information as appropriate.In accordance with best practice in prescribing this medication and taking account of the contraindications, warnings and side effects highlighted by the IMB, the Defence Forces screen all personnel for medical suitability.  The screening system automatically rules out from overseas service personnel with certain conditions, for example depression, anxiety, neurodegenerative disorders etc. which, as has been indicated by the Irish Medicines Board, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.  Pregnant personnel are also excluded.In the case of overseas missions to malarious areas, the medical screening involves an assessment of the individual's suitability to be prescribed the selected anti-malarial agent in line with current Irish Medicines Board guidelines.  This typically involves review of the individual's previous experience, if any, with the medication.  The individual's medical history is also screened for those conditions, which have been identified as precipitating serious side effects in association with the medication.  In addition, blood tests are carried out to ensure that the liver is healthy as liver disease is an accepted contraindication to the use of Lariam.It is the policy of the Defence Forces medical corps that personnel who are found suitable for Lariam should commence their medication three to four weeks in advance of their travel.  The purpose of this precaution is twofold.  While it allows a slow build up of the medication in the bloodstream, it also permits assessment by the person of his or her individual reaction to the medication while still in Ireland.  During this probationary period the individual can consult with a medical officer over any adverse reaction, minor or major.  Some minor reactions may be transient but if persistent or troublesome, the individual will be deemed to have sensitivity to the medication and will be found not medically suitable for the mission.There are three other anti-malarial medications available, Chloroquine, Malarone and Doxycycline.  However, in the case of each of these products there are specific reasons they are not suitable for use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa and I will now set these out.  Chloroquine is no longer in use because of the development of widespread resistance to it.  Doxycycline must be taken in the absence of dairy products and it can produce sun-sensitivity skin rashes in some individuals.  This is particularly significant when used in very sunny climates.  For this reason it is not recommended for first-line use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa.  Malarone is unsuitable for use as it is licensed for no more than 28 days continuous use in a malarious area by the Irish Medicines Board.  In this context, this prophylactic agent is only suitable for use where the overseas deployment does not exceed 28 days.Defence Forces medical records are mainly manually based at this time and the medical module of the personnel management system does not currently provide a diagnostic breakdown of the clinical status among the Defence Forces.  As such, there is no way of providing the specific information sought by the Deputy without examining every medical record of every recipient of Lariam.  Even then this would not include those who opted not to seek medical corps medical officer advice.  However, the Defence Forces have advised me that as of August 2010, three members of the Defence Forces had been treated for serious symptoms which may have been caused or contributed to by Lariam, although there is nothing conclusive in this regard.  I am advised by the military authorities that all these personnel have made a full recovery, and that their cases have been reported to the Irish Medicines Board.  In addition, there is a further cohort of seven personnel with less dramatic symptoms, and these remain under review.  Again there is no conclusive evidence that the use of Lariam was a factor in any of these cases.The Defence Forces take all necessary precautions in assessing the suitability of personnel before prescribing Lariam, in accordance with the prescribing instructions and information provided by the Irish Medicines Board.  Personnel are screened both before and after deployments and all necessary actions are taken to ensure that those with contraindications to Lariam use are deemed unsuitable for overseas service and are not prescribed the medication.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I tabled this question following a meeting I attended recently with some former members of the Defence Forces and others who are concerned about this subject.  A female attending that meeting asked if Lariam can affect fertility in some cases.  The Minister mentioned that a blood test is carried out in advance.  What exactly does it test?  An allegation was made that the reason Lariam is used is because is cheaper than other drugs.  Will the Minister advise on that?  Are the serving members advised of the side effects of Lariam before they take it?  The Minister said three people had serious side effects from having taken it and seven others had less dramatic side affects.  The number of people who had side effects to the medication appears to be very small.  From what was stated at that meeting, the bottom line is that more than that number have had serious side effects from taking this medication.Is the Minister satisfied there is sufficient tracking of people who have had side effects from the taking of Lariam as they continue to serve or on leaving the armed forces?  I understand the side effects from having taken a relatively small dose of Lariam can be experienced for quite a long time.  In respect of the people who had serious side effects, the Minister said that those people are now clear of all symptoms.  Is he satisfied that the tracking done in respect of those people is sufficiently strong for such a categorical statement to be made about them?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The issue of the medication affecting fertility has not been brought to my notice at any point.  I can have that matter checked for the Deputy.  I understand that the blood test is carried out in the main to establish whether there would be any impacts of side effects from the potential effects of Lariam on the liver.With regard to the prescribing of the medication, all personnel departing on a particular mission have the precautions relating to the use of Lariam, which I outlined in the initial part of my reply, applied to them.  In other words, for three or four weeks before they leave, they are in receipt of this treatment and if they have any side effects in that period, they are either assessed in terms of they being relatively minor or assessed as being of such size that the person is deemed unfit to travel.  That is the first level.  I understand that on return personnel are also tested in that respect.  It should also be noted that Lariam was approved first in 1989, and in 1996 and 2003 the Irish Medicines Board issued some additional information and advice on its use.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	321	What is the Minister's response to the fact that the US army ceased using Lariam in February 2009?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I am aware of the fact that the US army has ceased using Lariam.  I understand there may be two reasons for that.  The first is that many of its soldiers may not be operating in areas where there is a risk of contracting malaria.  My understanding is that the vast majority of armies which are deployed in sub-Saharan Africa in particular and in areas where the risk of contracting malaria from mosquito bites is very high continue to use Lariam mainly because it is at this point the drug that is most suitable for long-term use.  One of the other drugs I mentioned has very severe side effects which come into play very strongly in sub-Saharan Africa.  Another drug is only suitable and approved for continuous use of up to 28 days which, in the case of the vast majority of personnel on our missions, is far shorter than the four or six months stint for which people are deployed.  When one goes through all the evidence it transpires that in terms of meeting all the requirements that Lariam is the only suitable drug available at this stage for our personnel.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Within the context of consolidating the public finances, the Government is focused firmly on maintaining the operational efficiency of the Permanent Defence Force.  Government approval was secured in the context of budget 2010 for a level of 10,000 all ranks.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.I am advised by the military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as of 30 September 2010 was 9,625 comprising 7,845 Army, 776 Air Corps and 1,004 Naval Service personnel.While agreement had been reached with the Department of Finance on the employment control framework for the Defence Forces the official confirmation and details of it were only received on Monday last, 18  October 2010.   The ECF is based on a figure of 10,000 all ranks Permanent Defence Force personnel, appropriately configured across the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps to enable them meet the roles assigned by Government.Officials from the Department together with the military authorities are in the process of reviewing the structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Permanent Defence Force in accordance with the upper limits in ranks provided for in the ECF.  Thereafter a detailed proposal will be submitted to me.Detailed proposals on foot of the review of the structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Permanent Defence Force, within the reduced numbers, will include a phased plan for promotions.  This will seek to address the priority posts to be filled in relation to the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force.Overall numbers in the Permanent Defence Force, including numbers serving at various ranks will be subject to ongoing control and monitoring by the Department of Finance on a monthly basis.  This is to ensure compliance within the overall parameters and controls set by Government for each sector.  The ECF also sets out that it will be necessary to underpin the reorganisation with the required amendments to regulations and administrative instructions.While these are challenging times, my priority is to ensure that the Defence Forces are organised, equipped and staffed in a manner which will ensure that they can continue to deliver the services required of them by Government.I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	324	Will the Minister agree that the employment control framework is important for the Defence Forces both from the point of view of morale and operations?  How many promotions are currently on hold in the Defence Forces?  Can the Minister give a breakdown of those and if he does not have information to hand, perhaps he will provide it later.  Will he agree that the Defence Forces have already taken major cuts?  For instance, the Reserve Defence Force has been virtually wiped out at this stage.  It has taken a long time for the employment control framework to be agreed and the Minister might tell why it has taken so long to get it to this stage?  How long more will it be before he will be in a position to make decisions with regard to the promotions he mentioned?  Will it be one month, two months, six months or whatever?  What is his estimate?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I have no control over the review but Deputy Stanton is correct about the issue of morale.  The employment control framework, ECF, plays a significant role in this and should be dealt with as quickly as possible.  I expect the review's requirements to be undertaken as quickly a possible and given full attention.  Until the review is presented to me, I am not in a position to proceed, however.At yesterday's defence committee meeting I informed Deputies there were 150 personnel in acting-up posts.  It may be considerably higher with 95 officers and 95 non-commissioned officers in such posts.  This structure must be examined through the review.I hope the review will be presented to me as quickly as possible and that it can be implemented on a phased basis in a short time thereafter with the completion of the requirements under the ECF.  However, the completion of the review is outside of my control.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Are the personnel in acting-up positions being paid for the extra work?  Have other vacancies arisen in the Defence Forces that have not been filled by this procedure?  Will the Minister publish the ECF?  What does it contain?  We understood the ECF would provide the template.  Now it seems it has to be reviewed too.  In short, it will be a review of a review.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The majority of those in acting-up positions are paid.  The review will identify the structures and posts needed to meet the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.  Given the overall reduction of numbers in the Permanent Defence Force, some reduction in the number of officer and NCO posts is inevitable.I appreciate it can be frustrating for the Deputies opposite but it is difficult for me to give detailed information in advance of the completion of the review.  I do not anticipate publishing the ECF or the review.  On the other hand, I would be very surprised if I did not read it somewhere.  Professionalism has to be brought to bear in this review.  I see no reason for the review to be protracted.  I do not want to put a time limit on it because that may put unfair pressure on those involved.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	328	It might be no harm.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	329	That may be the case.The Deputy is correct the bulk of the work has been done with the ECF and it reflects the downsizing of numbers and the modernisation process.  As soon as the review is completed and approved by me, people will be brought into most of the positions in question.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	330	The Minister should put down a specific date for the review to be completed.  That would put pressure on for it to be finished promptly.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	331	That is one tactic I have learned in this post.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The function of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is to act as the ultimate point of appeal for and administrative investigation into complaints made by members and former members of the Defence Forces against other members or former members of the Defence Forces or against a civil servant of the Department of Defence.  The ombudsman may investigate a complaint in respect of an action or decision which may have adversely affected the complainant personally.  The action or decision complained of must have occurred no earlier than 1 December 2005.In 2007, the number of recommendations received from the ombudsman was 20 with 15 accepted and five rejected; in 2008, it was 21 with 15 accepted and six rejected; in 2009, 25 with 22 accepted, three rejected and two still to be decided; in 2010, none of the ten recommendations has yet been decided.The ombudsman's recommendations in these reports cover issues specific to the individual's complaint including proposals for redress in cases where the ombudsman has found a person has been wronged together with any systemic issues the ombudsman identified in the course of her investigation.In arriving at my determination on each case, I take careful account of all the ombudsman's findings and recommendations.  I also take into account the specific and unique requirements of the Defence Forces.  In cases where I accept a recommendation, this decision is conveyed to the chief of staff to ensure the action required to give effect to that recommendation is taken at the earliest opportunity.Where I accept a recommendation from the ombudsman which is of a systemic nature, this is referred to the appropriate branch of the Department or the Defence Forces for consideration in the context of the ongoing development of best practice human resources management.I welcome the constructive contributions made by the ombudsman in supporting improved human resources practices.  Since the establishment of her office in 2005, her input has assisted the Defence Forces in the revision of several human resources procedures including the selection processes for career courses and overseas service.  The ombudsman's recommendations have also informed the revision of selection processes for promotion, a new version of which is currently being progressed with the representative associations through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.In accordance with the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is independent in the performance of her duties.  She is required to cause a report on the performance of her functions under the Act to be laid annually before each House of the Oireachtas.  In her 2009 report, the ombudsman referred to several recommendations about systemic matters made by her in final reports which were accepted by the then Minister for Defence and the military authorities.  She stated the changes flowing from these recommendations will not only address the grievance in the individual case but will also ensure other members of the Defence Forces will not encounter bad practices, or good practices poorly applied, in the future.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Will the Minister agree the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is competent?  On what basis, would he not accept one of her findings?  Does he take advice from other parties?  If so, does this mean that someone else reviews the ombudsman's work?  If that is the case, one would wonder why we need an ombudsman.  Why is there a delay in deciding on the ten recommendations made by the ombudsman in 2010?  Is it because the recommendations were received late in 2010?  What is the delay over the two outstanding recommendations from 2009?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	334	There is a philosophical aspect to the Deputy's question as to whether the ombudsman is the final arbiter which we should not get into.The first recommendation in 2010 was received on 13 May 2010, the last on 4 October 2010.  These are relatively new and some work must be done on them.  Some decisions and determinations have been made in 2010 relating to cases disposed of by the ombudsman in 2008 and 2009.When an ombudsman's recommendation is received, her overarching advice is considered.  It is nearly always possible to incorporate that into best human resources practice.  Sometimes specifics in an individual case or recommendations on systems in the Department or the Defence Forces may warrant further consideration.  As with all ombudsman recommendations, the Minister will turn to the parent Department for advice.A total of 14 recommendations have been rejected since 2007.  Of those in 2007, four related to the educational criteria for a potential officers' course and one related to retention of pay and allowances.  In 2008, two related to the eligibility criteria for an aeronautical engineer course and one related to the eligibility of other candidates in regard to a promotion board.  In 2009, three related to non-selection for courses, one to non-payment of technical pay, one to non-selection for a course and one to non-selection for acting appointment.Another way to look at it is to examine the main categories of complaints to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  There are three chief categories — non-selection for promotion, non-selection for courses and non-selection for overseas service.  They account for more than half of the cases referred to the Ombudsman.  Other categories are pensions, transfers and allowances.  A few cases are of a systemic nature and I can supply the Deputy with details in that regard if he wishes.

Is that the reason the Minister has decided not to accept her findings or recommendations?  My question has still not been answered.  On what basis does the Minister make the decision not to accept a recommendation of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces?  How does he judge it?  Does he get advice from somebody else and, if so, who is the person or persons advising the Minister not to accept a recommendation?  How is it done?  The Minister should let us in on the secret or perhaps it is covered by the Official Secrets Act.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	336	There are three potential outcomes when the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces examines a case.  Let us say the ombudsman recommends completely in favour of the complainant.  If the Minister partially accepts that, he has rejected the ombudsman's recommendation.  In some instances the ombudsman recommends partial redress for the complainant.  If the Minister only accepts some of that, he is also rejecting the recommendation.  Finally, in some cases the ombudsman finds against the complainant.  I had intended to find out if the Minister has gone against any of those recommendations.  I doubt it but I will let the Deputy know if that has been the case.The case comes back from the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces and is examined by the relevant section or sections.  A file, which is usually quite large, is presented to the Minister, sometimes with recommendations or at least with advice as to the procedures that have been followed and the implications of the initial decision and of the ombudsman's decision.  Ultimately, it falls to the Minister to make a decision, but it is usually taken with some advice.

All of the Department's Dublin based Civil Service staff will relocate to Newbridge.  The Chief of Staff, the deputy chiefs of staff and a number of other military personnel will also relocate.  Relocation of staff to the new building has commenced and will be completed by 8 November 2010.  This accounts for the fact that I have some difficulty gathering information related to parliamentary questions.  Much of the key information is in crates that are on their way to Newbridge.  I am sure they will all be found safely for the next Question Time on defence.

The management advisory committee, planning and organisation branch, Defence Forces personnel policy branch, international security and defence policy branch, executive branch, legislation branch, litigation branch, property management branch, conciliation and arbitration branch, human resources branch, information systems branch, contracts branch and the office of emergency planning will be based in Newbridge.  The allocation of branches to Renmore in Galway is unaffected.  The finance branch, internal audit branch and parts of the information systems branch and human resources branch are already located in Renmore.The following military directorates will be located in Newbridge: strategic planning, finance, litigation, press office, conciliation and arbitration, legislation, and a component of military information communications and technology.  The remaining military directorates will be located at their current locations in Parkgate Street, St. Bricin's Hospital, Coláiste Caoimhín, Park House and McKee Barracks, all in Dublin, and also at Kickham Barracks in Clonmel, County Tipperary.

It has associated staff of slightly more than 50.  It will continue to be accommodated in Parkgate Street for the moment until it is relocated.  Members will be aware that there was a second phase to the decentralisation project which would have involved military personnel moving to the Curragh.  That element was postponed when decisions were taken in the middle of 2009 due to economic and budgetary matters.

Could he be more specific about what that means?  Is it months or years?  What is the plan or is there a plan for the communications centre, which is very important infrastructure?  Has the Minister plans to move this communications centre and, if so, what will be the cost of moving it and where will it go?  I understand there are many vacant offices in Parkgate Street.  Will the Minister move other elements of the military establishment into Parkgate Street from Glasnevin and other places around Dublin?  Will the building where Pádraig Pearse signed the order to surrender be retained in military hands?  Is the Minister aware of the historical importance of this building and will he work to retain it in the possession of the Department of Defence?

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 27, 33 and 49 together.The renewed programme for Government sets out the commitment for the preparation of a new White Paper on defence, for the period 2011 to 2020.  I have circulated a draft memorandum to my Cabinet colleagues outlining the proposed approach to developing the new White Paper.  I intend to bring a memorandum to Government in the near future seeking approval to formally launch the process.  The new White Paper will build upon the first White Paper on defence, which was published in February 2000.  This has provided the policy framework and a development strategy for the modernisation, reform and transformation of the defence organisation during the past decade.The new White Paper will set out defence policy for the period to 2020 having regard to the defence and security environment and the roles assigned to the Defence Forces.  It will chart a course for the continued development of the defence organisation and will facilitate planning for and delivery of the required defence outputs.  The process of developing the White Paper will include a broad consultative process encompassing other Government Departments and agencies, the general public, academic experts and other stakeholders.  Submissions will also be sought from the Defence Forces representative associations.  I expect to have a draft White Paper prepared for submission to Government in the second half of 2011.  The current White Paper on defence will continue to provide the policy framework pending the adoption of the new White Paper.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	359	Is it correct that the White Paper will not be available until the second half of 2011, which is another 12 months away, even though it was supposed to have been prepared by now?  Have submissions been received from representative organisations or interested bodies?  Has the Department advertised or asked for submissions from interested bodies or organisations?  Have advertisements been placed in the national media in this regard?  Will there be public consultation on the White Paper?  Is the Minister satisfied the key recommendations of the previous White Paper have been achieved?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The proposals in the first White Paper in 2000 have had a huge influence on the development of the Defence Forces into a highly professional, highly organised, well-resourced organisation and this would not have happened in the same away or as effectively in the absence of the White Paper.With regard to the new White Paper, I have invited a number of interested parties, among them the Defence Forces representative organisations, to have an involvement in the process.  I have advised Departments that I intend undertaking that process.  People who wish to make a submission or to have their voices heard need a reasonable period within which to do that.  A number of months in the early part of next year is the appropriate timeframe for that and it is worth doing.  Some organisations and individuals, including some in the academic world, with an interest in this area are anxious to have a constructive input to the process.  I am hopeful the Houses of the Oireachtas through the relevant committee will also be centrally involved in that.  I am not aware of any advertisements being placed at this stage but I will check that for the Deputy.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	361	Has virtually no work been done yet on the preparation of the White Paper?  Is the Minister saying nothing has happened, no advertisements have been placed and no submissions have been invited or received?  What will be his main goals for the Defence Forces as a result of the White Paper?  It looks like we will not see it for at least another year.  Can he assure the House it is his intention that the Defence Forces complement will remain at 10,000 and it will not fall below that?  Will he publish guidelines regarding what he wants to see in the White Paper?  Has he any work done on it to date?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Considerable work has been undertaken in the Department and I have been involved in trying to advance some of that.  The military authorities have been considering the implications for themselves and trying to predict what challenges their organisations might have to deal with over the next decade.  One element of that is an environmental analysis and much of that work will be done internally in the military and in the context of the defence and security environment both nationally and internationally.  Considerable knowledge and background information is available.  People may make submissions that have a fundamental impact on the direction and shape of the White Paper.It would be extremely damaging for the process if a Minister or somebody else in a position of authority relating to the White Paper set out narrow parameters within which he or she would constrain any submission that might be made.  We need on this occasion to do something similar to what was done in 2000, while learning from the experience of the past ten years, namely, to set out wide parameters and to encourage people to make their submissions in that context but not indicate to people that there are exclusions before the process of consideration commences.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Will the ongoing value for money review in respect of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, have an impact on the White Paper?  When does the Minister expect that to be produced?  There are also inordinate delays in getting that to his desk.He did not answer my question about his intentions regarding the size of the Defence Forces.  Will the complement remain at at least 10,000 in any event?  Will he also endeavour to ensure the White Paper is published while the Dáil is in session in order that we can debate it?  Many of these papers and reports are published at the end of the summer session as the Dáil rises and three or four months go by before anything happens.  Can he ensure this is published while the Dáil is in session in order that we can debate it while it is fresh and not have everyone else in the country debating it bar us?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	364	The size of the Defence Forces was agreed in the context of budget 2010 and that stands independently of the White Paper process.  I expect, however, the process to set out the requirements of the armed forces for the next ten years.  I always felt the figure of 10,000 was dangerous in the sense that it was open to attack on that basis that it could be said it was plucked out of mid-air.  I would have been happier with 10,100 or 9,750 because 10,000 seems to be a contrived figure.  In the context of the White Paper, I expect all the stakeholders will have an input and one of the underlying considerations will be what role the State expects of the military.  When the role is established, the size of the Defence Forces will flow from that.  If, for example, the White Paper were to envisage the role we discussed at a committee meeting yesterday regarding an overlap with the education system, that would have implications for the number of people involved and for the role of the military.  I am entirely open to considerations of that nature.  Ultimately, a decision will have to be made on the role and that will reflect on the strength subsequently.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	365	Will the memorandum the Minister is presenting to Government contain an estimated cost for producing the White Paper?  Will he give an indicative date by which it should be completed?Deputy Stanton asked about the value for money review of the RDF.  Where does that stand?  Will it be concluded in time to be considered in the context of the White Paper?  A member of the general staff should head up the RDF because there is a view within the organisation that until that happens, it will never be taken as seriously as it should.  I have raised this with the Minister previously   The Minister indicated he favours the participation of RDF members in overseas missions.  I take it that will be considered and included in the White Paper.There has been speculation recently that the Irish Army's participation in battle groups could be directed towards natural disasters and similar events.  The Minister has an interest in this.  Is this likely to be considered in the White Paper?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I apologise to Deputy Stanton; I missed the question about the value for money review for the RDF and another question he asked about the reserve earlier.  It is clear that a White Paper on the Defence Forces has to consider centrally within it the role of the reserve.  At the risk of being seen to overly impact on the process, it is instructive and interesting to consider the experience of countries where a model has evolved with a large reserve element and a small permanent element.  We ought to be prepared to learn from other people's experience in that regard.  One thing which disappoints me about the development of the reserve, or what some Deputies refer to as its non-development, is that it seems in the 2005 review several actions were pointed out as necessary to progress matters.  I have examined carefully the material available in this regard and it seems all these actions were implemented.  Most people maintain the desired outcome was not reached and this must be taken into account in examining the reserve element of the White Paper.Equally, the value for money element will form an important part of the process of the deliberation of the White Paper.  I cannot predict what the value for money review will propose, but there may well be recommendations to make with regard to the training of reserve people, joint exercises or, as Deputy O'Shea said, the deployment of reserve people overseas.  To be fair, the intention was to include some reserve people and that would have happened had other circumstances, unrelated to the process, not taken place.  That is a reasonable point and Deputy O'Shea often makes the valid point that some reserve people have capabilities, training and capacity which could be very useful in some circumstances.  That is a fair point and I believe it will be borne in mind.Regarding the memorandum for Government, I have already circulated a draft memorandum to other Departments.  One thing which bedevils us is an attempt to operate completely independently of others.  I have circulated the draft memorandum which will give other Departments an opportunity to make observations.  I do not expect to be delayed for too long before going with the formal memorandum and announcing the process.  A large part of the intervening period ought to be given to allowing people an opportunity to have an input.The question of cost from Deputy O'Shea has exercised me somewhat.  I have put it to my officials that in so far as it is possible we should try to do it from within our resources and, in the main, I believe we have the capacity to do so.  It appears difficult to do so but if possible I wish to do it.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	369	It is not my intention to include the Civil Defence because of the organisational structure under which it operates.I missed one question put by Deputy O'Shea, an important question concerning battle groups.  One of my colleagues, the Swedish Minister, indicated his interest in the deployment of battle groups in humanitarian disaster areas.  On occasion, the capacity of battle groups could be entirely appropriate.  Sometimes, the capacity which battle groups bring may not be helpful in a particular situation.  For example, it could be argued that in the case of Haiti, helicopter and aerial support would have been the key requirement and current battle group configurations would have been unlikely or unable to provide such support.  On the other hand, from our point of view and that of our military people with their professionalism and expertise, it is important that their capability be developed to the standard of the battle group in the first instance.  It is even more important in the context of deployment overseas that the highest level of interoperability between various nations be achieved such that we can make our contribution in any international area where we are operating in a relatively seamless way.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The State Claims Agency deals with claims arising from accidents involving Defence Force vehicles in Ireland.  The Chief State Solicitor's office deals with claims arising from accidents involving Defence Force vehicles overseas.  The information requested is set out in the following table:YearNumber of Defence Force road traffic accident claims receivedNumber of resolved Defence Force road traffic accident claimsCompensation paid out (rounded to the nearest €1,000)€2006717434,0002007108258,00020082416356,00020091831572,0002010 (to date)721625,000Total66932,245,000The total cost of the claims settled is €2,245,000 for the 93 claims I am dealing with.  The State Claims Agency works with the Defence Forces on an ongoing basis to examine incidents in order to identify and, if possible, obviate any potential risk of injury to civilian and Defence Forces personnel.  The State Claims Agency advises that the directorate of transport and maintenance has done considerable work in this area.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I thank the Minister for his reply.  I note a question that his predecessor answered two years ago to the effect that in the preceding five years the amount for claims was €1.1 million.  The figure the Minister has given us today is €2.45 million.  This indicates there has been an increase in the settlements although, as the Minister rightly points out, some of the claims settled in more recent times were historical claims and we should not read too much into the figures.I am interested in the co-operation between the State Claims Agency and the Directorate of Transport and Maintenance.  Are there any particular trends emerging regarding the nature of accidents?  Has it anything to do with the age of the fleet or the quality of the army vehicles?  Is there any evidence or information emerging that would pinpoint the areas that give rise to most accidents?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I do not believe such detail is available.  Apart from the age of the vehicles, to which Deputy O'Shea referred, the variables might include the number and length of journeys undertaken, the number of personnel involved and similar issues which may not be easily extrapolated from tables of this nature.I have some additional information with regard to outstanding cases.  I made the point that some 66 cases arose during those years but 93 cases were settled.  Clearly, several of the cases settled predated 2006 and that would have led on from year to year.  In 2010, a total of seven claims have been made up to this point.  It appears that two of these have been settled and five remain unsettled, a relatively high proportion in a short time.  In 2009, some 15 of the 18 cases were still not settled.It seems there is a considerable time lag between the time of an accident and its resolution although I have seen some information which suggests that the involvement of the State Claims Agency has shortened that timescale.  There are some long-standing historical cases which have not been progressed.  They remain part of the total because they have not been resolved one way or another.  As for the kernel of the question, I have not been able to find a pattern that would indicate the causes.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	373	How many cases are outstanding at this stage?  Are any civilians involved in any of the claims?  Has the roll-over protection system installed been reviewed or is there any intention to review it?  How is it working?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	374	Several claims have been outstanding for a very long period and are, de facto, dormant, dead or unlikely to be reactivated in some instances.  There is a total of 53 including those for 2010.  At least 15 of these predate 2006 and one goes back to 1998.  These are not active in any sense.Regarding vehicles, the close interaction between the transport people and the State Claims Agency has undoubtedly led to changes.  It is not dissimilar to our discussions previously on the ombudsman; we learn from what takes place.  I am unclear how many civilians were involved and I must get that information for the Deputies but I believe there would be some involvement.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Go raibh maith agat.  On the face of it, with the caveat that one can read too much into figures and that one may not come up with sound conclusions because the figures cover a timespan, we do not seem to have many serious accidents.  How many of the claims settled can be described as serious accidents and how many are relatively minor accidents?  The safety record of the Army seems to be quite good.  Have comparisons been made with other defence forces to shed light on the subject?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Deputy O'Shea is correct that there is a considerable amount of movement by military vehicles on a daily basis through several parts of the country.  There is a major number of opportunities in terms of exposure to the road.  I do not have a breakdown in respect of the seriousness of accidents.  The number of fatalities is thankfully small, but any fatality is one too many.  By serious accidents, I presume Deputy O'Shea means accidents where people have permanent incapacity of a major nature.  I do not have the detail on that but I will try to find it for the Deputies.  It may be difficult and may take some time but it is interesting information and may feed into what one can learn from this.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 223 together.The number of female personnel serving in the Permanent Defence Force on 30 September 2010, the last date for which figures are available, was 557, of which 456 were serving in the Army, 32 in the Air Corps and 69 in the Naval Service.  In terms of rank, the breakdown of female personnel serving on 30 September 2010 was 143 officers, 167 non-commissioned officers and 247 privates.  The percentage of female personnel serving on 30 September was 5.79% of the overall strength of the force on that date.The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.  Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces has no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit.  The Department does not have access to statistics on the percentage of female members in other national armed forces.  The Defence Forces prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment.  Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks.  The military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	378	It seems there is a very slight reduction in the number of women serving compared to the information given out by Deputy Killeen's colleague two years ago. There is a higher percentage of women serving at the rank of captain and lieutenant. The total figure for officers was 9.2% at that time. The Minister's predecessor addressed the issue of women in 2006 by reducing the height requirement from 5 ft. 4 in. to 5 ft. 2 in., increasing the potential recruitment pool of women from 60% to 90% of the female population. Has the reduction in the minimum height requirement brought about an improvement in the number of female applicants? Two years ago, the percentage of women serving at NCO level was4.09%.  This seems to be quite low.  What are the Minister's comments on these observations?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	379	Deputy O'Shea is correct.  The percentage of women eligible increased from 60% to 90% of the population through the decision of the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, in 2006.  In 2007, the TNS MRBI study was commissioned to examine the retention and recruitment of women to the Defence Forces.  I have asked for information on the applications to the current recruitment drive.  The final figures are not available but for one of the divisions the percentage of female applicants may be lower than 2%.  I will revert to the Deputies when I receive the final figures on this.  If that turns out to be the final figure, it seems an extraordinary change.  Heretofore, the number recruited slightly exceeded the percentage of applicants at the initial phase.  It is too early to know if this will be the case but I am concerned about what I am hearing because we would be moving in the opposite direction.  This would be undesirable and we may have to take action in respect of recruitment policy.  We have discussed the subject of retention in a previous Question Time and concerns exist, although it is not as dramatic as the matter I have just mentioned.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	380	Did the TNS MRBI survey from March 2007 make a number of recommendations and can the Minister tell us what has been done to implement those recommendations?  Can he point to recommendations implemented?  There was a recommendation that women need role models in the Permanent Defence Force.  Has anything been done in that regard?  What has been done to promote a dual gender image for the Permanent Defence Force rather than the current masculine image?  Does the Minister have plans in this regard?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I understand some progress has been made on virtually all of the recommendations arising from the TNS MRBI survey.  Some of the recommendations are under way in respect of family friendly policies in the Defence Forces.  It will be difficult to judge in the short term but one expects, over a period of five to ten years, to see a marked improvement in retention figures.  However, if that was undermined at the recruitment end by a lower cohort of applicants, one would have a particular challenge that requires a different approach.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	382	A high level of satisfaction expressed by serving female members in the TNS MRBI study.  On the subject of job security, pay, benefits and the variety of work on offer the rate of satisfaction was 70% or 80%.  Is it timely to gauge the level of satisfaction again?  This may have some bearing on the drop-off the Minister referred to in respect of female applicants.  If these figures turn out to be true, something is seriously amiss and this must be identified and addressed.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	383	The bulk of the recommendations arising from the 2007 report related to internal matters and much work has been done in that regard.  The external issue of presenting a particular image is somewhat more challenging and the problem appears to be borne out if the application figures are as low as is indicated.  This may be a function of a larger cohort of males being available and interested than was the case previously.  The total number of female applicants may be static but may represent a smaller percentage of the total application cohort.  We must examine this in great detail.  My initial reaction to updating the survey findings is that the 2007 is fairly recent.  I do not have a closed mind in that regard.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I propose to take Question Nos. 9 and 214 together.There are two committees dealing with emergency planning that come under the aegis of my Department, namely the Government taskforce on emergency planning and the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning.The Government taskforce on emergency planning, which was established in 2001, is comprised of Ministers and-or senior officials from all Departments and key public bodies that have a role in emergency planning and response.  The taskforce supports co-ordination of emergency planning across Departments and agencies.  It provides a forum for keeping emergency planning high on the agenda of all Departments and it examines cross-cutting issues that impact across Government.The taskforce meets on a regular basis.  The most recent meeting was held on Thursday last, 14 October, which was its 67th meeting.  The interdepartmental working group was also established in 2001.  It supports the work of the Government taskforce and carries out specific tasks under the direction of the taskforce.  It has met on 57 occasions.  The most recent meeting took place on 20 September 2010.The taskforce is a forum for sharing information among the key stakeholders and much of the expert advice is provided from within the taskforce.  External experts are invited to make presentations to the taskforce from time to time on a range of emergency planning issues.  The taskforce has recently sought expert advice for drawing up a template which will inform Departments and agencies of the key benchmarks against which emergency responses may be reviewed.  The work is currently being carried out by the Dublin City University business school and will be completed shortly.Representation on the taskforce can be at ministerial level or, more usually, at senior official level while representation at interdepartmental working group is at senior or middle management level.  The names of the officials currently serving on the Government taskforce on emergency planning and the interdepartmental working group are listed in the tabular statement which will be circulated.  There is no additional cost to the State arising from either of these committees as the officials attend and participate as part of their normal duties.  The office of emergency planning is a joint civil and military office within the Department, which supports the Government taskforce and the interdepartmental working group.  The office also manages the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre, which was activated during last winter's severe weather events and during the volcanic ash emergency that occurred in April to May of this year.  All costs associated with the office of emergency planning and with the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre are met from the Defence Vote.Membership of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning:(Principal and Deputy Representative)Deputy Tony Killeen,Minister for Defence (Chair)Office of Emergency PlanningFred BradleyCol Declan HayesJerry KelliherDepartment of DefenceBrian SpainMichael O'BoyleDefence ForcesMajor General Ralph JamesCol S.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	385	What role does the Reserve Defence Force have in emergency planning?  Has it been used during the past 12 months in the various weather emergencies that have occurred?Could the Minister outline the various types of emergency for which we are preparing?  Is he satisfied the Defence Forces are called out in a timely fashion?  At times it appears the Defence Forces are called out very late in the day.  Has any work been done to assess whether it would be better to call on the Defence Forces earlier than has been the case?  I accept they cannot act on their own; they have to be invited to assist by the Garda or civilian authorities.  Does the Minister agree it would be better if they were called in at an earlier stage in some cases?  If that were the case they could provide greater help rather than at the last minute when the state of emergency has become acute.  It appears the Defence Forces are seen as a last resort.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I am aware the Reserve Defence Force was deployed in at least one situation during the weather emergencies because I saw it happening.  The Reserve Defence Force is available to be called in when the judgment is made that the Defence Forces are required.  It is difficult to be specific or prescriptive about when to call in the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces are represented on the taskforce.  The judgment is made at Defence Forces level in the area in which an incident is being dealt with.There are either 43 or 46 individual emergency types set out in the framework.  In each of those cases the lead Department is specified, as are the support agencies and Departments that would come into play in each case.  The most recent emergency was the incidence of volcanic ash in which the Department of Transport was the lead agency.  In the case of both the severe ice and snow and the prior flood events the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was the lead agency, although in practice on the ground the local authorities were responsible.  Prior to that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was the lead agency in the pork dioxin crisis.  Immediately prior to that was the avian flu issue on which the Department of Health and Children was the lead Department.  Many examples are set out and in each of them the lead Department is specified.There is a question about the type of emergency involved, whether it is local, regional or national and whether, when, if and how a state of emergency ought to be declared.  The taskforce has worked on some trigger mechanisms that give guidance in that regard.  Inevitably, each crisis that is dealt with by the taskforce better informs the response for the next one.  Many exercises are carried out jointly by agencies and Departments in anticipation of having to deal with emergencies.

He told me members of the Garda Síochána are covered, as are members of the Health Service Executive.  I assume members of the Defence Forces are covered.  However, members of local authorities are not covered.  Could the Minister shed light on that issue?  If there is a problem, is there a proposal to deal with it?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	388	The issue of personal liability arose in the past three or four taskforce meetings I attended.  A number of initiatives are under way in that regard.  I understand the Department of Justice and Law Reform has introduced legislation to clarify the situation with regard to some personnel.  As a general principle my understanding is that if people carry out whatever duties they undertake with due care and attention and in a professional manner their position is copper-fastened.Issues have arisen in terms of intervention by individual householders in clearing ice on the footpath outside their premises or in the case of voluntary organisations being called in to support agencies to deal with an emergency.  I do not refer to the Reserve Defence Force or the Civil Defence in this instance, rather a local sporting organisation.  Issues arise in that regard.  I have sought clarification from the Attorney General on how best we might address that.  Regardless of legislative change I have no doubt but the principle of responsibility in the event of one doing something inappropriate would be likely to apply.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Joanna Tuffy — the need to maintain community employment schemes and job initiative schemes in Clondalkin; (2) Deputy Jimmy Deenihan — the delay in acquiring a site for the proposed new Garda station for Tralee, County Kerry; (3) Deputy Frank Feighan — the provision of a third level college in an area (details supplied) in County Leitrim; (4) Deputy James Reilly — the issue of cutbacks at Cavan General Hospital; (5) Deputy Thomas P.

Broughan have been selected for discussion.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I wish to raise the perceived threat of cuts to community employment schemes and job initiative schemes in Clondalkin in the forthcoming budget.  Along with other public representatives I recently attended a meeting in the Clondalkin Education & Employment Development Services, CEEDS, centre in north Clondalkin.  It is based in Áras Rualach.A number of people were present who were representing the various schemes.  Community employment and job initiative workers informed me, local representatives and Oireachtas Members from the constituency about the good work they do.  The centre itself is an example of the valuable work that is done.  CEEDS runs the local training initiative in north Clondalkin.  I am familiar with the centre for many years.  It has come on in leaps and bounds in terms of improved delivery of courses.  I brought some of the groups into the Oireachtas.  It is heartening to see how the course participants develop.  At a recent graduation class people were talking about going on to do nursing and join the Garda Reserve.  Most of those people would have left school without any qualifications.  CEEDS gives them the opportunity of getting the equivalent of the leaving certificate through FETAC qualifications.  CEEDS employs community employment workers, many of whom were previous attendees of the local training initiative.  Some course participants come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  On some schemes, people might have formerly had problems with addiction and other issues.  There is a view that community employment and job initiative schemes do not offer much to society but in Clondalkin they do good for the community and provide important services while offering employment opportunities to people who might not be able to re-enter the workplace otherwise.When I visited in September, I was given some letters by people on the schemes.  One person wrote that if her job initiative was cut, it would have a devastating effect on her, her family and her community.  She has written, "The job initiative scheme has given me the strength and confidence to move on with my life and out into the community, where I am at my best working with young people and their parents, giving them confidence to achieve for the themselves the education that is their right".  Another letter from one of the JI workers made the point that if these schemes were cut, the effects would be felt in Clondalkin because so many people there are on jobs initiative and community employment schemes in the area.There are 50 job initiative employees working for many of the local community and voluntary organisations, helping them to provide a good service in Clondalkin.  The Neilstown Parish Social Action Group employs workers under these schemes, providing support to local national schools, the St. Vincent de Paul charity shop and the Beacon of Light counselling service among others.  Disadvantaged areas have come on in leaps and bounds in recent years and it would be terrible if the Government now made the mistake of cutting back on such schemes because it will have devastating effect on the local community and the people employed on them.I worked on such a social employment scheme when I left college in the 1980s, the equivalent of a community employment scheme.  It is better to be employed than not employed and although the salary may not be much more than what people would get on social welfare, people want to work for the community and enjoy it.In recent years, the criteria for people who can work on such schemes have been narrowed and often it is those who come through the national rehabilitation service and those who have come through drug addiction support who need a place on such schemes.  These schemes are worthwhile and with unemployment rising, we should increase them.  I ask the Minister of State to maintain present numbers at the very least.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on community employment programmes and job initiatives programmes.Community employment is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The purpose of CE is to help unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance both their technical and personal skills.  An important feature of CE programmes is the development opportunity they give to the individuals who participate on the programmes.  Eligible projects are those which respond to an identified community need; provide development for participants in areas involving heritage, arts, culture, tourism, sport and the environment; have the agreement of relevant trade unions; do not displace or replace existing jobs; and offer valuable work experience for participants.In April 2000 the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment introduced capped limits on the amount of time that a person could participate on a CE scheme.  Such capping was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through the programme, allowing new participants who would not otherwise have such an opportunity to avail of the programme.  To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 the standard three year CE cap was revised to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a six year period on a CE scheme, based on participation since 3 April 2000.  Subsequently, in 2006 the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a social welfare disability linked payment, including those under 55, was increased by one year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.Funding for CE in 2010 has been provided with a view to maintaining overall numbers on FÁS schemes.  At present there are almost 23,000 people participating on CE schemes nationally.  In the budget, provision was made for an increase of 500 CE places, bringing the total number of places available to 23,300 during 2010.  FÁS is currently considering the feasibility of setting up a number of additional schemes, as well as expanding existing schemes to absorb the 500 places.A wide range of client groups are given access to the opportunity CE provides, including lone parents, persons with disabilities, stabilised substance abusers and unemployed persons aged under 55.  Currently there are 4,914 lone parents and 5,355 people with disabilities participating on CE, while 1,000 places are ring fenced for the CE drugs task force.  The number of places on the drugs task force is kept under constant review.  In delivering these places, FÁS operates flexibly in the management of this allocation to maximise progression to the labour market, while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.FÁS continues to welcome proposals from local sponsors to carry out projects, and all proposals are considered within allocated budgets and participant numbers.  The provision of places is managed through a standardised application process between regional FÁS offices and local sponsor and community organisations, and any issues regarding the allocation of places are dealt with in this context.  However, it should be remembered that while participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.FÁS will continue to operate the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.  Persons who are considered job-ready are progressed through FÁS employment services onto other options, thus freeing up CE places for others in greater need.The job initiative programme was launched in July 1996 and continues to provide full-time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over who were unemployed for five years or more and in receipt of social welfare payments over that qualifying period before entering the programme.  The main purpose of JI is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  FÁS operates the programme with a dedicated budget of €34.5 million for 2010.  There are currently 1,329 participants, with this number decreasing annually due to retirement and for other reasons.Following changes introduced in 2004 by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, contracts for existing JI participants are renewed, allowing them the option to continue until they are 65 years of age.  There is no recruitment to the programme due to this change.JI participants are involved in a wide range of useful community services, including after-school care, breakfast clubs, homework clubs, gardening and security services.  In addition, JI projects provide jobs in the social economy in administration and maintenance.  The areas supported by these workers include community centres, creches, enterprise centres and parish properties.  Currently, there are 15 schemes on the CE programme in the Clondalkin area, comprising 16 supervisors, eight assistant supervisors and 309 participants, while on the JI programme there is one scheme and 46 participants.  FÁS has confirmed that there are currently no plans to reduce the numbers on either programme.This Government will continue to support into the future the positive role of FÁS employment schemes in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons, while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, the operation of the schemes will be kept under constant review in the context of the current difficult fiscal and unemployment situation.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	392	Recently, I was invited to launch a programme in co-operation with the Carrick-on-Shannon Education Centre and St. Angela's college and it struck me how suitable a location Carrick-on-Shannon would be for a third level centre.  It would need the Government's support.  The Department of Education and Skills will publish the higher education strategy shortly.  The collaboration between institutes of technology, universities and higher education centres seems to be at the strategy's heart.  Does the Minister of State foresee existing educational facilities in smaller towns like Carrick-on-Shannon and rural towns having a role in developing these links?Many years ago, there were many small towns in the area, but Carrick-on-Shannon has moved from being a county town to a regional town.  It is the regional centre for Boyle, Ballinamore, Drumshanbo, Mohill, Elphin and Strokestown.  It has grown significantly in the past ten years due to the upper Shannon renewal scheme.  The town contains many houses and apartments of quite good build, but there is also a great deal of office space that could be rented or bought cheaply, for want of a better word.  The Bank of America, in the form of its subsidiary, MBNA, is in the area and there is a great deal of employment.  The River Shannon is a significant tourist attraction and many people are driving across the island of Ireland to avail of the hospitality in Carrick-on-Shannon.However, the town's hotels need an economy of scale.  The town needs an educational facility to copperfasten its tourism industry.  If we got hundreds of students to live in the town, it would help the region.  The town and its environs boast the Landmark Hotel, the Bush Hotel, many guest houses, Kilronan Castle, Lough Rynn and Lough Key Forest Park, which is a significant centre of tourist activity.  I was involved in securing up to €10 million for the park, which has gone from strength to strength and is attracting more than 160,000 visitors per year.Carrick-on-Shannon and its surrounds have become a new regional area.  A Government could endorse this move with the addition of a third level facility.  What is the Minister of State's opinion in this regard?
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  I thank Deputy Feighan for raising this matter on the Adjournment.There are more than 20 publicly funded higher education institutions, seven of which are universities and 14 of which are institutes of technology.  Ireland is a relatively small country and, in view of the current level of third level provision nationally, there are no plans to develop new third level institutions at this time.  It should be noted that the information that is available on admission rates to higher education by county shows that County Leitrim has a relatively high rate.  A national survey of new entrants to higher education carried out in 2004 and published in 2006 shows that Leitrim had an admission rate of 64.2% compared to a national rate of 55%.As the Deputy stated, a new national strategy for higher education has been under development by a high level group under the chairmanship of Dr. Colin Hunt and comprising national and international expertise.  The question of how Ireland's higher education system should be configured to best meet the challenges of the next two decades has been under consideration as part of this work.  The group has completed its work and the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills will consult with colleagues on its findings in the coming weeks.Development of a new national strategy for higher education affords a timely opportunity to review the environment for higher education and the challenges and changes impacting on the sector.  The strategy will provide a vision and related set of national policy objectives for higher education over the coming 20 years and identify the operational framework for the higher education system, which will enable it to deliver these objectives.In developing its report, the strategy group engaged in extensive consultations with stakeholders and wider national interests.  A first round of consultation was completed in the summer of 2009 under which an open call for written submissions elicited a significant and valuable response.  More than 100 submissions were received from institutions, educational bodies and representatives of the enterprise community as well as a number of individual personal submissions.  These submissions provided valuable input on a wide range of issues and are available on the HEA website, www.hea.ie.In addition to this first round of consultation, a series of independently facilitated discussion forums were held with members of the academic community, third and fourth level students, enterprise and business leaders, second level policy makers and teachers.  Bilateral meetings with other stakeholders, including the higher education institutions, were also held.The higher education sector has a key contribution to make to the future growth of the economy and the well-being of society.  Through the development of the strategy, the Government wants to build on the many strengths of the sector in order to provide an environment where it can develop in a way that best serves the country as a whole.I would also like to take this opportunity to point to the range of further education provision available in County Leitrim.  Further education provision is designed to meet the needs of young early school leavers, provide second chance education for those who have not completed upper second level education and provide vocational education and training for labour market entrants and re-entrants. The main providers of further education programmes are the vocational education committees, VECs.In County Leitrim in 2009, there were more than 150 participants on full-time and more than 1,250 participants on part-time further education programmes funded by the Department of Education and Skills through the VEC sector.  The full-time participants included 92 post-leaving certificate, PLC, participants in the VEC.  An additional 16 PLC places were allocated to Carrick-on-Shannon community school.  In 2010, a funding provision of €2 million has been provided for further education programmes in County Leitrim.  I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I recently asked to raise the issue of cutbacks at Cavan hospital because they caused patients serious distress and discommoded many of them.  I understand that Deputy Crawford and Senator O'Reilly have received many representations from people trying to get their appointments rearranged.  I am not surprised this has happened, since we warned about the inadvisability of cutbacks at Navan hospital.We must examine what occurred in the case of Navan hospital.  For several weeks, a lead clinician was rolled out to state it was an issue of patient safety.  When I stood across the floor from the Minister for Health and Children two weeks ago, however, she admitted to Deputy English and me that it was a budgetary issue.  Alongside Deputy McEntee, I have attended meetings in the area and it was clear that the hospital provides an excellent service, with 1,800 surgical cases treated per annum in an elective fashion.  There is nowhere for these people to go.  As such, their conditions will deteriorate, they will become emergencies and they will end up at the accident and emergency unit of Cavan hospital, Beaumont Hospital, the Mater, Blanchardstown hospital or Drogheda hospital.  It is clear that none of those hospitals has the capacity to deal with the additional workload.We have had nothing but cutbacks under the Government.  Bed numbers have been reduced and no additional beds have been provided under co-location.  Consequently, we find ourselves in this mess.  No attempt has been made to reform the health service, cut backroom staff numbers or change gross inefficiencies.  When I spoke with Deputy Crawford today, he told me he received representations from a lady who had been waiting three weeks for an appointment to have confirmed breast cancer removed.  She has been referred from Cavan to the centre in Dublin.  This is not acceptable.  The other issue one must ask about is the great number of closures that took place because of an increase in referrals to the emergency department and medical assessment unit.  Are we now given to believe this has all been resolved, that a week later these services are able to resume because the surge has disappeared and is unlikely to come again as we enter the winter months?  That is not credible and in her answer the Minister of State must address how the sudden increase in activity occurred, what her view is vis-à-vis its recurrence and the chances thereof.   That chance is very high.  Ambulances will be directed to other hospitals where possible; endoscopy tests have been cancelled.  Endoscopy will pick up internal illnesses of the gastrointestinal tract, the gullet and the bowel long before they are symptomatic.  These can be very serious conditions such as cancer, ulcerative colitis and many other diseases such as Crohn’s, which, if left untreated, can cause serious long-term illness and, in the case of cancer, catastrophic consequences, as happened to the late and very brave Suzy Long.There is no way Beaumont Hospital can cope.  People are not only waiting on trolleys, but are waiting on chairs for days on end.  I heard that directly from a doctor at the hospital.  We are now told there will be further cutbacks of €1 billion or, at least €600 million.  How are we going to cope in the coming winter?  In spite of all this, Navan hospital remains closed, elective surgery remains cancelled and 28 further beds have been closed of which 15 are medical and 13 surgical.  This will be a winter of serious discontent for the people of County Meath.  I fail to understand why the Government continues to cut front line services instead of addressing the waste in the HSE — the €1 billion spent on overtime last year, the €120 million on taxis and the €60 million on medico-legal payouts, of which €20 million goes straight to lawyers.  There was the €92 million spent on agency staff who, people will report, are at least 36% more expensive than recruited permanent staff.  The consequence is that people who could have been employed full-time are only employed part-time.I hope the Minister of State will address these issues in her response and we do not receive a pre-written departmental missive that will be meaningless.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.In recent weeks, Cavan General Hospital experienced an unprecedented 40% increase in referrals to its emergency department and medical assessment unit.  In addition, there was a very significant rise in medical referrals and medical admissions to the hospital from September.  In order to ensure patient safety, the HSE introduced temporary curtailments, which were confined to medical outpatient services and day services. This response was solely due to the increase in activity and not due to any planned budgetary reduction.  It is important to emphasise that all emergency services, oncology services, antenatal clinics and phlebotomy services were not affected and continued as normal throughout the curtailment period.  A significant number of clinical procedures including endoscopy and surgical procedures also continued, based on the clinical presentation of the patients.  These interventions were managed on a day-to-day basis by the clinicians involved.Hospital management and clinicians are actively working to ensure that patients who had their appointments deferred this week will now be rescheduled and prioritised for appointment and-or procedures as quickly as possible.  It is also important to note that the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group has one of the shortest waiting lists for endoscopy and surgical procedures in the country.  All services resumed as normal at Cavan on Monday, 18 October.  Emergency activity within the hospital has decreased significantly.  At 2 p.m. yesterday there was only one person waiting on a chair or trolley in Cavan emergency department compared to 11 people two weeks previously.The Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland provided the HSE with advice regarding safety issues in relation to surgery at Navan hospital.  Acting on this advice, the HSE decided to cease all emergency surgery at the hospital immediately, with effect from 1 September 2010.  As the Deputy will appreciate, patient safety has to be the overriding principle in our health system.  The transfer of acute and emergency surgery from Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, was always a long-term objective of the north-east transformation plan.  The plan is designed to build a health system that is in line with the model of care emerging internationally.Following on from the transfer of acute and emergency surgery, there is a decreased need for surgical and medical beds in Navan.  As a result, a medical ward, which opened in Navan for three months only to support the reconfiguration of medical services in Louth County Hospital, is due to close on a phased basis.  The HSE is closing a number of surgical beds in Navan Hospital due to the transfer of services.  The closure of these beds is managed through a combination of patient discharges, the cessation of admissions to wards and the phased relocation of patients within the hospital.  The process is reviewed on a daily basis by senior hospital management team.The hospital remains the regional centre for elective orthopaedic surgery and it expects that all of its complex joint replacement surgery procedures planned for 2010 will be completed by mid-November.  From then the unit will become a five-day unit and will concentrate on completing this year's planned, less complex, minor surgery cases.  An orthopaedic outpatient department initiative will also be undertaken in November and December in Navan to address the outpatient orthopaedic waiting lists in the north-east region, namely, individuals who are awaiting an assessment.I wish again to emphasise that patient safety is central to the delivery of health services.  People must have confidence in the care they receive and have the best possible outcomes.  All decisions regarding the operation of health services will be taken with patient safety as the priority.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	398	In recent weeks, householders in two areas of the Dublin city north fringe have become deeply upset by a series of illegal occupations of development lands and new roads in this major new urban district.  On a three hectare site owned by Dublin City Council and a smaller area owned by BP Excavations at Newtown, Dublin 17, an illegal occupation began about three weeks ago and formerly empty fields are now occupied by mobile homes and other vehicles.  The road through these lands is the entry and exit for Newtown Court, a very successful National Association of Building Co-operatives, NABCO, voluntary housing development of over 200 rental and mortgage-paying householders.  The area is also immediately adjacent to the 200-plus households of the Snowdrop estate of Darndale-Belcamp parish.  Householders have grave concerns on environmental, health and planning grounds at the failure of the authorities to immediately secure the vacant lands at Newtown and their earlier failure to prepare and implement an area action plan as repeatedly requested by me for this land.Discussions have taken place between Dublin City Council area management, the Garda Síochána, local residents and representatives of the illegal occupiers in recent weeks.  I am informed that Dublin City Council is preparing to take a legal injunction to request the ending of the illegal occupation.  I am also informed that most of the illegal occupiers formerly lived in Dublin City Council tenancies and that repeated offers of council housing were made when this group allegedly illegally occupied the St. Laurence development lands at Santry, Dublin 9.  Dublin City Council's legal costs in earlier lengthy actions at Santry exceeded €90,000 and a further €80,000 was spent on preparing and restoring homes for the illegal occupiers in an agreed location at the N32.  Legal action to end the Santry illegal occupation was drawn out for over two years because of infirmities in existing law.In late September a second illegal occupation took place on the Northern Parkway, a key new arterial road of the major north fringe development at Clongriffin, Dublin 13.  From discussions with DCC area management and the Garda Síochána, I understand that the vehicles which illegally occupied the Northern Parkway re-located from Newry, County Down.  In the past five years local residents in Marrsfield, Clongriffin and Belmayne have worked hard with local representatives, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, the Garda Síochána, developers, health and education authorities and other stakeholders to try to provide all the necessary, new services and complete this vast new urban district.  Many residents, often with large mortgages and in negative equity, are now desperately worried that the masterplan for the region is falling apart and that the derelict and vacant lands in the area will fall into dereliction or this type of illegal occupation.  That is why I have repeatedly asked for SDZ status for the north fringe.  I am informed that Mr. Gerry Gannon, the lead local developer, is now also seeking a legal injunction on this matter.Let me state very clearly that Coolock and Dublin north east generally is the home of several hundred settled Traveller families and the whole community is very proud of the integration and solidarity between all our communities over the past 30 years.  In their inputs into area development plans local community leaders have agreed to the planning and construction of secure, modern homes for Traveller families.  Ironically, a number of Traveller homes were planned for an overall masterplan for the Newtown area which, regrettably, Dublin City Council never prepared.   However, all our communities have no time for illegal occupations which are harmful to the sustainable planning of these north fringe areas and to our very good community relations.I ask three things of the Minister. First, he should empower Dublin City Council to end quickly the illegal occupations concerned, given that several offers of housing were already made to families with local connections.  Will he now take whatever emergency legislative steps are necessary to empower local authorities such as Dublin City Council and Fingal to protect development lands which have been left unused by the property bubble and banking disaster?  Clearly, local authorities like Dublin City Council and Fingal, and new national authorities such as NAMA and the HSC, must have the power to end immediately any illegal use of public lands, whether under a reformed section 24 of the Housing Act, under the planning Acts or any new legislation.  Long drawn out court proceedings must be avoided.Second, once again I appeal to him and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to put the north fringe forum on a statutory basis to empower stakeholders, including NAMA, the HSC and surviving developers, to lay out a clear programme to repair fully and complete the north fringe urban district.  This might include, for example, using some of these lands as sports fields and community facilities until major development resumes.Third, will the Minister co-ordinate Dublin City Council, the NRA and other agencies to enable the Newtown Court estate to have an entry-exit onto the N32 at Newtown-Clare Hall as well as the current access onto Belcamp Lane?
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who welcomes the opportunity to outline the law on illegal occupation.The current law is, in the Minister's view, very comprehensive and he has not been made aware of any shortcoming requiring attention.  Part IIA of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 was inserted by section 24 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002.  The provisions of section 19C(1) of Part 2A prohibit any person, without the consent of the owner of the land, from entering or occupying the land or bringing any object onto such land where it is likely to damage the land substantially or prejudicially affect any amenity to do with the land; to prevent anyone entitled to use the land or any amenity associated with it from making reasonable use of the land or the amenity; to otherwise render the land or the lawful use of the land or amenity unsanitary or unsafe; or to substantially interfere with the land or amenity or the lawful use of the land or amenity.A garda may arrest, without warrant, a person committing an offence under 19C(1).  The law also provides for a member of the Garda Síochána, who has reason to believe that a person is committing an offence under this section, to demand of the person his or her name and address and to direct that person to leave the land and to remove any object from the land which is owned or under the control of that person.  It is an offence for a person to fail to co-operate with the Garda.A person who is found guilty of illegal occupation or any other offence under Part IIA of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a maximum fine of €4,000 or a sentence of up to one month in prison or both.  The Garda may also remove any objects from the land where the owner has refused a Garda direction to do so.  Such objects may be returned to the owner following a written declaration by the owner.  The Garda Commissioner has discretion to require the owner to pay for any costs reasonably incurred on removing and storing the object.  The Commissioner will be entitled to sell or dispose of such objects if not claimed and removed.  The net proceeds of the sale, less the cost of removal, storage and sale, may be returned to the owner.The implementation and enforcement of Part 2A of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 is a matter for the Garda and the courts.  Matters relating to local authority housing and the offering of accommodation are the specific remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.On the specific issue of development lands, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has stated that it is primarily the responsibility of developers and the owners of unfinished developments to ensure that their sites are completed satisfactorily and that unfinished and unoccupied parts of the developments are adequately secured from unauthorised access.  Construction sites are hazardous locations that, if left unprotected without proper security and perimeter fencing arrangements, can pose hazards to the public.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will shortly publish a consultation draft of best practice guidance on managing unfinished housing development sites.  This will clearly set out the roles and responsibilities of developers and local authorities in this regard.

I have no function in the day–to–day administration of the Irish Red Cross Society and as such, I do not get involved in the day-to-day running of its affairs.In fact the Geneva Convention places an obligation on national Governments to protect the independence of the Red Cross Organisation.The issue of the bank account in question is being dealt with by the Society.  It is my understanding that all funds have been properly accounted for and that there is no suggestion of any wrong doing in relation thereto.  The Society has put in place new and revised procedures so that such circumstances do not recur.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	401	Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners.Responsibility for the prevention of crime, including people trafficking, rests primarily with An Garda Siochána. However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.  The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue or recovery, and drug interdiction operations.The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles. The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and eight. The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time. All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of our Exclusive Economic Zone using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda Síochána, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking. The Air Corps provides air support and, on occasion, carries the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities. There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.An Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Working Group (MarSur WG), chaired by the Department of Transport, has been established under the auspices of the Maritime Co-ordination Group of Assistant Secretaries. The Working Group will work towards the creation of a common information-sharing environment to enhance safety and security within the Irish maritime domain. The Department of Defence and the Naval Service are represented on this Group along with other Government Departments and Agencies responsible for safety and security in the maritime environment.Internationally, the establishment in 2007 of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre — Narcotics (MAOC-N) has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea. MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members. An Garda Síochána and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at the Centre in Lisbon. Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the Centre when requested by the Joint Task Force.I am satisfied that the Naval Service and the Air Corps have adequate facilities to effectively support the civil authorities in the areas of drug interdiction and people trafficking.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 22 together.At the outset, let me state categorically that cost is not the basis for determining the prescribing of Lariam to Defence Forces personnel.I am advised by the military authorities that there are four main chemo prophylactic anti-malaria agents available to the Defence Forces. These are Lariam, Chloroquine, Malarone and Doxycycline. Lariam is considered an effective anti-malaria drugs for the type of malaria our troops were exposed to in Chad and Central African Republic. Troops being administered the drug are informed of its effects and its use is very closely monitored by the military medical authorities. In addition, there is intensive medical screening of troops before Lariam is prescribed along with in theatre monitoring and post mission assessment.Lariam is an Irish Medicines Board approved drug with a weekly dosing regime. From a compliance viewpoint, it is easier to manage a weekly dosage than a daily medication.  While the main recognised disadvantage of Lariam is its side effect profile, I understand that the Irish Medicines Board remains of the view that the benefit/risk profile for the product remains acceptable.  The Irish Medicines Board continues to review the safety of this and all medicines on an ongoing basis and updates the product information as appropriate.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 23, 26, 56 and 221 together.Ireland has offered, through the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time. This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland's standing Army (excluding Reserves) and demonstrates Ireland's commitment to the cause of international peace. This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.Ireland is currently contributing 148 Defence Forces personnel to 12 different missions throughout the world. Of the 148 personnel currently serving overseas, 90 are officers and 58 are drawn from other ranks.  Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement below.The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 43 personnel and the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 19 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO.With regard to future deployments, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.Following the unexpected withdrawal of the Defence Forces battalion from Chad earlier this year, we are currently examining a number of options for future deployment, and in this regard we have been in contact with the UN in relation to its requirements for missions. In these difficult economic circumstances due regard will have to taken of available resources when considering options for contributing to international peacekeeping operations in support of the United Nations. A number of options are being developed by Civil and Military management in the Department, including a possible deployment to UNIFIL, and subject to their advice, I would expect to be in a position to consider the proposals and bring forward recommendations to Government as appropriate in the near future.Apart from a recent EU request to despatch members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) military mission to contribute to the training of Somali Security Forces (EUTM Somalia) being carried out in Uganda, no other deployments are planned or envisaged at this time. Five (5) Irish personnel took up duty with the mission at the end of April 2010. No requests have been received from the UN for deployment of personnel to other UN missions.There are no plans to deploy members of the Reserve Defence Force on overseas peace support operations.Number

A Steering Committee comprising representatives from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Department of Finance is overseeing the Review.  In accordance with revised guidelines for the conduct of Value for Money Reviews, an independent chair was appointed to the Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee has met on six occasions since the review commenced, including a meeting that took place earlier this week.  A Working Group has also been formed to assist the Steering Committee with the review, comprising of both civil and military personnel. The working group has undertaken an extensive programme of work under the direction of the Steering Committee over this period.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	405	My Department plays an important role in relation to emergency planning and response. The Office of Emergency Planning, which is a joint civil and military office within the Department, facilitates coordination of emergency planning across government departments and agencies. The Office supports the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and the Interdepartmental Working Group on Emergency Planning. All government departments and those agencies with an emergency planning function are represented.The Office supports me in my role as Chairman of the Government Task Force. It also assists in the preparation of my confidential Annual Report to Government on Emergency Planning. The Office also manages the National Emergency Coordination Centre, which was activated during last winter's severe weather events and during the volcanic ash emergency that occurred in April/May of this year.As the Deputy will be aware, emergency planning in this country is developed on the ‘lead department' principle. This means that each department is responsible for planning for those emergencies that fall within its remit. The Framework for Major Emergency Management sets out the structure enabling the Principle Response Agencies (An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and Local Authorities) to prepare for, and make a coordinated response to, major emergencies and the Defence Forces respond within that Framework.The Defence Forces' response arises from requests for assistance from An Garda Síochána (aid to the civil power) or from other agencies of the State (aid to the civil authority). While the provision of Defence Forces' support is dependent on operational commitments, every effort is made by the Department and the Defence Forces to respond to requests as swiftly and efficiently as prevailing circumstances permit. For example, during the flooding and severe weather events of 2009/2010 the Defence Forces provided support to An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and Local Authorities using a wide range of resources.The negotiation of prior response arrangements through Memorandums of Understanding and Service Level agreements between the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the relevant Government Departments continues to facilitate a planned response to emergency situations. These agreements have been completed with a number of Departments and Agencies. Departments/Agencies are also encouraged to engage in joint training exercises with the Defence Forces.

This was my first visit to Defence Forces personnel deployed overseas.On 27 September 2010, I had the honour of visiting Camp Ville in Kosovo where I met Irish personnel serving with KFOR's Multinational Battle Group (Centre) and attended a lunch hosted by the Irish contingent. Following the downsizing of Ireland's contribution to KFOR earlier this year, a total of nineteen (19) personnel currently serve with this mission.I also paid a courtesy call on Major Gen Erhard Buhler (Germany), Commander of KFOR and met with the Minister for the Kosovo Security Force, Mr. Fehmi Mujota.  During my meeting with Mr. Mujota, I took the opportunity to signal Ireland's continued strong support for Kosovo's independence, which the Irish government recognised in February 2008.During my visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina on 28 September 2010,  I travelled to EUFOR's Camp Butmir,  where I paid a courtesy call on Major General Bernhard Bair (Austria), Commander of EUFOR. After a tour of the Camp, I had the privilege, along with the Chief of Staff, of presenting medals to Irish contingent personnel. The Irish contingent serving with EUFOR currently comprises 43 personnel.I also met with Dr Valentin Inzko, High Representative and EU Special Representative (HR/EUSR) for Bosnia & Herzegovina. We discussed the situation in the country in advance of the Presidential and parliamentary elections, which took place on 3 October, and the prospects for progress on the necessary constitutional reform in the months ahead.The visit to both Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina afforded me an opportunity to see, at first hand, the dedication and professionalism of military personnel and the tremendous work done overseas by the Irish Defence Forces. I conveyed to the troops, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, our deep appreciation for the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service.

In nominating persons to Central Council, the Government considers that it is highly desirable that the Society should have on its governing body, people with a wide variety of knowledge and expertise, gained through work experience in both the public and private sector and/or volunteer experience with the Society.  The Government, in recommending to the President a person to act as Chairman, had to nominate a person who it deemed would make a positive contribution to the affairs of the Society. Such a role assumes even greater importance now given the imminent changes to the Society's organisation.  Taking the above into account, Mr David J O'Callaghan was recently appointed, by the President, as the new Chairman of the Irish Red Cross.  Mr. O'Callaghan is a former career civil servant with vast experience of public administration at senior management level.  He has experience of matters relating to the Irish Red Cross Society from his previous post as Secretary General of the Department of Defence, which he held from 1995 to 2004.  Having met Mr. O'Callaghan, I am fully confident that he will discharge the duties assigned to that office under the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939 and the Rules of the Society and help expedite the reform process underway in the Society.As I have said on many occasions in the past, the Irish Red Cross Society is an independent statute based organisation with full power to manage its own affairs.  I have no function in the administration of the Society and I do not get involved in the day-to-day running of its affairs.The current governance proposals arise from a resolution passed in November 2007, by the Council of Delegates of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) which urged all National Societies, as requested by Action 3 of the Strategy for the Movement, to examine and update their Statutes — the rules of the National Societies — and related legal texts by 2010, in accordance with the "Guidance for National Society Statutes" and relevant International Conference resolutions. This task is being undertaken by many Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world. The current proposals have the support of the IFRC.The formal report of the Working Group established by the Irish Red Cross Society to examine the issue of governance was received in the Department of Defence in January of this year. In order to implement the recommendations made there will be a requirement for significant amendments to the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939. Representatives of the Society and Officials from the Department of Defence have had a number of meetings to discuss the specific changes required to the 1939 Order and work is ongoing in that regard.

Locations are considered on the basis of the optimum yield that can be derived for Ireland.  An Irish naval vessel is considered sovereign Irish territory regardless of its location, and therefore a ship affords rare promotional opportunities for state agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, An Bord Bia and the IDA to support Irish industry and services.  In the current economic climate, promoting Ireland to business communities abroad has assumed added importance.This year, L.E. Niamh undertook a voyage to South America, visiting Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Chile at a cost of approximately €740,000, excluding pay and allowances.The deployment of the LE Niamh was in support of the strong cultural and heritage links between Ireland and South America and to mark the celebration on the bicentenaries of independence by Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Chile. The deployment was also aimed at promoting Ireland and Irish interests to the local business communities and strengthening links with the region.  This visit to South America provided a unique opportunity to highlight the fact that Ireland is open for business.During the course of the visit, in excess of 12,000 people visited the ship, including diplomats, politicians, business leaders and senior officials.  The experience was also of enormous benefit to the Naval Service in terms of professional development and training.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	409	EU action in response to humanitarian crises is framed in the context of an overall international approach that brings together the United Nations, the Red Cross movement, humanitarian NGOs and others in support of action by the national authorities of the country concerned.  There is general agreement that humanitarian assistance should respect the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence.  Accordingly, humanitarian action should be civilian in character and in leadership.  However, it is established UN and EU policy that, in certain circumstances, humanitarian aid may draw upon military assets, notably for logistical and infrastructure support.  This would normally occur where the use of military assets can meet a critical humanitarian need. Operating procedures and coordination arrangements for military support to EU disaster response have been put in place, within the overall framework of humanitarian operations, retaining their civilian nature and character.Battlegroups are an important component of the EU crisis response toolbox and the deployment of Battlegroups should be dealt with in this context. Within the Battlegroup concept one potential use is the delivery of humanitarian aid.  That said, there is considerable divergence of views among partners on the use and potential effectiveness of Battlegroups in a humanitarian context.  Depending on the nature of the humanitarian assistance required, a Battlegroup may not be in a position to provide the necessary capabilities and may not always be the most appropriate response.Ireland's position on this matter is pragmatic and needs-driven. Under a civilian lead, military assets could be deployed where this is the most appropriate response.  Such assets could be drawn from a stand-by EU Battlegroup or generated for that specific purpose from the Member States, whichever is the more appropriate and, more importantly, immediately available.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 35 and 59 together.The Civil Defence Board was established in 2003 and is charged with the development and management of the organisation at national level. The Board is obliged to submit its Strategic Plan for approval every three years.  I launched the 3rd Strategic Plan of the Civil Defence Board covering the period 2010-2013 in June 2010.The strategies identified by the Board place a high priority on the organisation's involvement in developing training and recruitment programmes and in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, which identifies a wider role for Civil Defence in emergency response.In 2010, the Civil Defence Board received a grant of €6.061m, of which almost €1m is allocated to the purchase of equipment. This funding has enabled the Board to equip volunteers to a very high standard.The Board has re-equipped all of its casualty trained volunteers with up-to-date training manuals, DVD's and instructional material, bringing the organisation into line with the statutory requirements laid down by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC).The Civil Defence College is also a recognised certifying body for the preparation and delivery of courses approved by statutory and other national bodies such as Further Education & Training Awards (FETAC) and Irish Heart Foundation (IHF).  This accreditation combined with the diverse range of training available to Volunteers is also of great assistance to them in developing career opportunities outside of Civil Defence.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I fully appreciate that many of our citizens are facing difficulties in the current environment not least those who have lost their jobs due to the economic downturn.  The Government is making every effort, within available resources, to support all those who face hardship.  In addition, there are various schemes in place through the Department of Social Protection, including Family Income Supplement, to support those on low incomes.The circumstances surrounding an application for Family Income Supplement or indeed any other scheme operated by the Department of Social protection is a private matter between the applicant and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I would not be aware, therefore, of the eligibility of individual members of the Permanent Defence Force to receive such allowances.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25, 37, 40, 43, 46, 47, 52 and 53 together.I am advised by the Military authorities that a total of 5,885 deployments to Africa have taken place since 1 January 2000, involving 4,127 personnel.  In the period since 1 January 2000 the anti-malarial prophylactic agent for those who have served in Central Africa was and is Lariam.I am further advised by the Military authorities that since 1 January 1990, a total of 336 Permanent Defence Force personnel have died in service.  Of these, 18 personnel had served in overseas missions in continental Africa.  The specific cause of death of personnel is not recorded on individual personal files.The Military authorities have further advised that the main anti-malaria agents available to it are Chloroquine, Malarone, Doxycycline and Lariam.  The choice of drug is based on the mission and not on the rank of the individual.The Defence Forces consider Larium to be the most effective anti-malaria drug for the type of malaria our troops were exposed to in Chad and Central African Republic.Lariam is authorised for use by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) which is the statutory regulatory body charged with regulating the use of medicines, to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines available in Ireland.  Lariam was first authorised for use by the IMB in 1989.  While certain risks associated with the use of the drug were highlighted in Drug Safety Newsletters in 1996 and 2003, it remained of the view that the benefit / risk factor profile for the product remained acceptable.  The Board continues to review the safety of this and all medicines on an ongoing basis and updates the product information as appropriate.In the case of each of the other three anti-malaria products I referred to earlier, there are specific reasons as to why they are not suitable for use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa and I will now set these out:Chloroquine is no longer of use because of the development of widespread resistance;Doxycycline has to be taken in the absence of dairy products and it can produce sun-sensitivity skin rashes in some patients. This is particularly significant when used in very sunny climes. For this reason it is not recommended for first line use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa;Malarone is unsuitable for use as it is licensed for no more than 28 days continuous use in a malarious area by the IMB.  In this context this prophylactic agent is only suitable for use where the overseas deployment does not exceed 28 days.All personnel volunteering for service overseas are initially screened for medical suitability and fitness.  Fitness to serve overseas is defined by Medical Classification Code.  Personnel who do not achieve the specific Code are deemed to be ‘medically unfit' for overseas service.  This automatically excludes personnel from overseas service with conditions such as depression, anxiety, pregnancy, neurodegenerative disorders etc which, as indicated by the IMB, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.In the case of overseas missions to malarious areas, the medical screening involves an assessment of the individual's suitability to be prescribed the selected anti-malarial agent in line with current Irish Medical Board guidelines.  This typically involves review of the patient's previous experience, if any, with the medication. The patient's medical history is also screened for those conditions which have been identified as precipitating serious side effects in association with the medication.  In addition, blood tests are carried out to ensure that the liver is healthy as liver disease is an accepted contraindication to the use of Lariam.It is the policy of the Defence Forces Medical Corps that those patients who are found suitable for Lariam should commence their medication three — four weeks in advance of their travel.  The purpose of this precaution is two-fold — while it allows a slow buildup of the medication in the bloodstream, it also permits assessment by the patient of their individual reaction to the medication while still in Ireland. During this ‘probationary' period the patient can consult with a Medical Officer (MO) over any adverse reaction, minor or major. Some minor reactions may be transient but if persistent, or troublesome, the patient will be deemed to have ‘sensitivity' to the medication and will be found not medically suitable for the mission.All overseas missions provide a medical service for participants.  In the case of large Irish units serving with the UN etc. the primary care may be provided by the Medical Corps.  Where the Medical Corps provides the primary care service, and where the Medical Officer (MO) forms the opinion that the patient has developed a ‘sensitivity' to Lariam while overseas, the patient will be advised to cease taking the medication, substitute it with a ‘second-line' agent, and the patient will be monitored to ensure symptoms subside.  Appropriate ‘anti-symptomatic' medication may be required in the interim and appropriate restrictions will be placed on duties.Furthermore, all personnel, symptomatic or otherwise, are reviewed at their repatriation medical and advised on the further medical management of any medical problems which may have arisen while overseas.The Defence Forces have advised me that as of August 2010, three members of the Defence Forces had been treated for serious symptomatology which may have been caused or contributed to by Lariam, although there is nothing conclusive in this regard.  I am advised by the military authorities that all these personnel have made a full recovery, and that their cases have been reported to the Irish Medicines Board.  In addition, the Defence Forces psychiatrist reports a further cohort of seven personnel with less dramatic symptomatology, and these remain under review. Again there is no conclusive evidence that the use of Lariam was a factor in any of these cases.The Defence Forces take all necessary precautions in assessing the suitability of personnel before prescribing Larium in accordance with the prescribing instructions and information provided by the Irish Medicines Board.  Personnel are screened both before and after deployments and all necessary actions are taken to ensure that those with contraindications to Larium use are deemed unsuitable for overseas service and are not prescribed the medication.It is my understanding that the US Forces stopped using the Lariam due to concerns about inadvertent prescribing of the drug to soldiers who should not take it.  In this regard, I am advised that the US authorities undertook mass administration of mefloquine (the generic name for Lariam) for soldiers serving in areas subject to malaria.  The Defence Forces do not mass prescribe but rather follow all the instructions issued by the IMB in order to fully screen out personnel who may potentially have an adverse reaction to the medication.Finally, I am assured by the military authorities that that they are fully satisfied with the arrangements currently in place in relation to all aspects of the administration of Lariam as an anti-malaria drug to Defence Forces personnel.  Consequently, I have no plans to set up a panel of medical experts to inspect all the soldiers who have served in Africa in the last ten years.  Equally, I have no plans to meet any individuals in this regard.

Defence Force Regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of foreign-nationals to the Defence Forces.   People from diverse backgrounds have already been employed in the Defence Forces, but this has mainly been in certain specialised areas. This has worked well — albeit on a limited scale.Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, Apprenticeship Competition, General Service Enlistment or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments. All applicants for each of these entry streams are required to meet qualifying criteria.The Defence Forces make every effort to reach out to all groups in society in order to ensure that the selection pool from which potential candidates is drawn will be reflective of the wider society.They have established links with cultural community groups based in Ireland, in order to brief them on the Defence Forces and its current entry requirements.In order to ensure best practice in respect of recruitment and retention of personnel from diverse groups the Defence Forces is a participant on the Irish Management Institutes Cultural Diversity Bizlab Group.Furthermore they have a defined officer appointment holder in the area of equality and cultural diversity who ensures that the Organisation is fully compliant with all aspects of equality and diversity requirements in the DF personnel policies and practices. In November 2007, the Defence Forces issued their Equality, Diversity and Equal Status Policies.  This document includes the Defence Forces:Anti Racism Equality Policy,Discrimination and Promotion Policy,Equality of Opportunity in Recruitment and Advertising of Jobs,Equal Opportunities in the Interview Process,Equality of Opportunity in Job Orientation and Job Induction,Equality of Opportunity in Overseas Service, Career Promotion and  Progression.A Dignity Charter has also been put in place, which clearly identifies the requirement for Defence Force personnel to uphold the values of tolerance, dignity and understanding and to respect the right of each individual to dignity in their work environment.There are generally more applicants for positions in the Defence Forces than places available. The Department and the Defence Forces are fully committed to ensuring that all suitably qualified candidates who wish to do so are given the opportunity to join the Defence Forces. The primary focus in recruitment is to attract people with the core competencies required by the Defence Forces.

Cyber security is multi facetted. The nature of the threat and the potential impact also varies considerably depending on the approach and objective of those with malicious intent.  In the first instance, each State agency, business and individual should take every precaution with regard to their security. Awareness of security, the risks and available safeguards, can be seen as the first line of defence for the security of information systems and networks.  I am aware of considerable activity in this regard.  My colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has undertaken a number of awareness campaigns aimed at individuals, SMEs , the education sector, the public sector and business.In addition, Minister Ryan has commissioned a report on the development of a national cyber security strategy. The report will deal with the current state of readiness should a cyber attack occur. It will also contain a review of current international best practice on cyber security and the structures that should be developed to oversee the Government's response to cyber attacks.  This report will address the following issues from a national perspective:Detection of cyber attacksReaction to cyber attacks from Government, Government agencies and operators of critical IT infrastructureDevelopment of structure to oversee planning and response to cyber attacksDevelopment of structures to keep the public aware of threats and appropriate responses.I am informed by Minister Ryan that the report has been drafted and is currently being discussed at interdepartmental level.

The Consultants recommended a programme of major change.  As recommended by PA, Working Groups have been set up to progress the various projects identified. These continue to meet regularly and all have submitted reports.  The Line officer, in the rank of Colonel, to command the new Centralised Medical Unit for the Medical Corps took up duty on the 14 June 2010.  He has responsibilities for implementation of the Model for Future Medical Service.  PA did not identify structures, numbers and processes within the Centralised Command Structure in detail. Work on this is being undertaken by the Organisation and Establishment Working Group which will bring forward recommendations on an overall structure to include staff appointments for the Future Medical Service. Following consideration by the Steering Group of their initial report, the Working Group is now conducting some further analysis and this is expected to be finalised in early November 2010. Final reports from two of the Working Groups, the Training & Education and the Financial Arrangements & Outsourcing Working Groups have now been completed.  The final report of the Future Medical Information System Working Group will be completed shortly, and it, along with the aforementioned final reports, will be considered by the Steering Group, whose decisions are expected by mid November.  The Clinical Review Working Group is not due to submit its final report until 30 November 2010.  However, monthly reports are being submitted in the interim and action on items is being taken as decisions are made.Following completion of this phase of work by the Working Groups and the finalisation and approval of their reports by the Steering Group, the full implementation of the PA recommendations can then be progressed.  The process for implementation also requires that consultation with the Representative Associations must take place regarding any change within the scope of representation.  The development of the Medical Corps forms part of the agreed programme for Government. This includes the expansion of the capacity of the Medical Corps to deliver a range of medical facilities on UN mandated missions.  I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad. The structure and systems recommended by PA have been designed to meet the demands and needs of the modern Defence Forces at home and overseas.

In the letter it was suggested that 62 Reserve Battalion be renamed 62 (Pearse) Reserve Battalion to uphold the memory of Pádraig Pearse. When the Reserve Defence Force was reorganised in October, 2005 it was decided to adopt a numerical unit designation only. This method of naming enables the new Reserve Defence Force unit to be associated with their affiliated Permanent Defence Force unit.Enquires were made again with the Military authorities regarding this matter. The recommendation made was that the current numerical designation be retained. The rational for this retention is that the dominant aspect of unit designation for all Reserve units continues to be underpinned by Reserve Defence Force and Permanent Defence Force unit affiliation.The Deputy may wish to note that one of the seven barracks in the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh Camp is named Pearse Barracks and this provides a fitting memorial to the name of Pádraig Pearse.

The Defence Forces are not a principal response agency as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management.Requests for Aid to the Civil Authorities are met within the normal Defence Forces means and capabilities, and the Department of Defence does not purchase specialised equipment for the Defence Forces with the sole purpose of rendering Aid to the Civil Authorities. However, certain vehicles and equipment held by the Defence Forces to meet their current operational requirements can also be used to provide assistance to the civil authorities, as was done during the severe weather of late 2009/early 2010. Some of the equipment used by the Defence Forces included 4x4 Patrol vehicles, 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8 trucks, pumps, helicopters and boats.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	421	The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was established under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004. On 19 September 2005, Ms Paulyn Marrinan Quinn SC was appointed by the President, upon the recommendation of the Government, as the first Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. Her term of office was extended for a further three years from 19 September 2008. The function of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is to act as the ultimate point of appeal for, and administrative investigation into, complaints made by members (and former members) of the Defence Forces against another member (or former member) of the Defence Forces, or against a civil servant of the Department of Defence. The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces may investigate a complaint in respect of an action or decision, which may have adversely affected the complainant personally. The action or decision complained of must have occurred no earlier than 1 December 2005.To date, the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces has submitted one hundred and twenty one (121) Final Reports and of these a ministerial determination has been made in 108 cases. Of the cases on which a ministerial determination has been made, the recommendations of the Ombudsman were fully accepted in 83 cases and partially accepted in a further 11 cases. There were 14 cases where the recommendations of the Ombudsman were not accepted. A further 13 final reports are under consideration and my determination in these cases will issue at the earliest opportunity, once I have considered all of the factors relevant to each case.The Ombudsman's recommendations in these reports cover issues specific to the case in question including proposals for redress where the Ombudsman has found that a person has been wronged. The reports may also include systemic matters that the Ombudsman has identified in her investigation of the case. In arriving at my determination on each case I take careful account of all of the Ombudsman's findings and recommendations. I also take into account the specific and unique requirements of the Defence Forces. I refer recommendations of a systemic nature to the appropriate Branches of the Department and to the Defence Forces for consideration in their ongoing development of best practice human resource management.The input of the Ombudsman has assisted the Defence Forces in the revision of a number of HR procedures including the selection processes for career courses and overseas service. The recommendations in the Ombudsman's reports to me have also informed the revision of selection processes for promotion, a new version of which is currently being progressed with the representative associations through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.In accordance with the terms of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is independent in the performance of her duties. She is required to cause a report on the performance of her functions under the act to be laid annually before each House of the Oireachtas. In her 2009 Report the Ombudsman referred to a number of recommendations about systemic matters made by her in Final Reports which were accepted by the Minister for Defence and the military authorities. She stated that the changes flowing from these recommendations will not only address the grievance in the individual case but will also ensure that other members of the Defence Forces will not encounter bad practices, or good practices poorly applied in the future.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	422	On Tuesday, 5 October 2010, I addressed the Annual Delegate Conference of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). I sought to make my address relevant, positive and informative. I commenced by paying tribute to former Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Dermot Earley. He was a man who displayed exceptional leadership qualities, an extraordinary devotion to duty and unwavering commitment and professionalism over his many years of service in the Defence Force.I addressed such diverse issues as the Defence Force's continuing commitment to overseas service, investment in infrastructure and equipment and career opportunities. I also addressed the current economic climate and I stated that we are charting our way through the most challenging of economic circumstances, both globally and at home.The main focus of Government is on the economic challenges facing the country and our citizens. In managing the current major contraction of the Irish economy the Government is required to take stringent measures, which impact on every citizen of this State. These decisions are imperative and necessary if we are to chart our way successfully to a more sustainable future.The present financial situation precludes the Government from providing the level of resources that were available to the Defence Forces in previous years and this is in line with the broader public service. It is necessary to keep under review all aspects of our Defence expenditure while still maintaining the core capability of the Defence Forces. Comprehensive reform of the Defence Forces and an extensive investment programme over the last decade has ensured that the organisation is in a healthy state to maintain outputs within a reduced budgetary provision.I commended the delegates for their continuing delivery of high quality public service in the face of very necessary restrictions in terms of personnel and resources. I continue to work with officials from the Department of Defence, the military authorities and my colleague the Minister for Finance to ensure that Defence spending provides the best possible value for money.The Deputy's interest in my speech is appreciated and it can be accessed from the Department of Defence website www.defence.ie.

I hope to convene a meeting of the All Party Oireachtas Consultation Group on the Centenary of the Rising in the coming weeks.The work of the Group to date has been addressed towards the re-instatement of the annual military commemorations in Dublin at Easter, the review of current conservation and development projects and a consideration of outline arrangements for a commemorative framework to be implemented in the anniversary period.I look forward to working with the Group in the coming months with a view towards a comprehensive commemorative programme to be implemented across the anniversary period, centered on official initiatives but also including academic, community, diaspora and commercial initiatives.Since entering office, I have reviewed several projects and proposals in relation to commemorative initiatives of the relevant period.The most significant current project at my Department is the Military Service Pensions Archive project. This Archive is the largest remaining source of unpublished material relating to the events of the Independence years. I am glad to report that significant progress has been made towards having these records available to the public and to historians in good time for the Centenary of the Rising in 2016.  Significant progress is being also made with projects in other Departments.The restoration of the yacht Asgard   with which Erskine Childers imported arms for the Volunteers is at an advanced stage at the National Museum of Ireland, Collins Barracks.Renewal works were undertaken at Arbour Hill including restoration and extension of the existing church car park, repair and restoration of all existing cemetery graves, repair of cemetery pathways and the planting of new trees.An examination by the Office of Public Works of the suggested relocation of the Abbey Theatre to the GPO complex is nearing completion.I am also aware of a number of private and commercial initiatives relating to the struggle for Independence.With the support of TG4 and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, an independent production of biographies of the seven signatories of the proclamation was prepared and features in current broadcast schedules.The Moore Institute, under the guidance of the National University of Ireland, Galway are planning a series of symposia in 2010 to commemorate 1916, in conjunction with Queens University Belfast and Trinity College Dublin.Complementing the continuing programme of refurbishment works at Glasnevin Cemetery, a joint initiative between the Glasnevin Trust and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is erecting headstones on the graves of former personnel of the British armed services who died from injuries received during the World Wars.  Most of the 43 headstones to be installed this year relate to those who died in the conflict of 1914-18.I have been impressed by the widespread interest reflected in the planning and activities in anticipation of the Centenary anniversaries.  I am looking forward to meeting Deputies shortly with a view to development of a comprehensive commemorative framework for the period.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 226, 227 and 228 together.I am advised by the Military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 September, 2010, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 9,625 comprising 7,845 Army, 776 Air Corps and 1,004 Naval Service personnel.    Within the context of consolidating the public finances, the Government is focused firmly on maintaining the operational efficiency of the Permanent Defence Force.  Government approval was secured in the context of Budget 2010 for a level of 10,000 all ranks.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.While agreement had been reached with the Department of Finance on the Employment Control Framework (ECF) for the Defence Forces the official confirmation and details of it were only received this week.  The ECF is based on a figure of 10,000 all ranks Permanent Defence Force personnel, appropriately configured across the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps to enable them to meet the roles assigned by Government.Targeted recruitment is being carried out in 2010 in order to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  In this regard I have approved the recruitment of 40 recruits to the Naval Service.  The recruitment process is nearing completion and it is intended that the successful candidates will be inducted into the Naval Service in December 2010.In addition, the Military authorities are currently in the process of recruiting to the Army.  A platoon will be enlisted to the Eastern Brigade and to the Southern Brigade by the end of the year.  The recruitment process to enlist a platoon to the Western Brigade and to the Defence Forces Training Centre, The Curragh, is scheduled to follow on early in 2011.I also secured Government approval for a Cadetship Competition in 2010.  This recruitment process is also nearing completion.  A total of 30 Cadets will be enlisted to the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps on 1 December 2010.While it is not possible to anticipate strength figures for 2011 and beyond, I can confirm that with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.I am advised that, at this time, the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.

I expect to receive a full report on this investigation shortly.In order to afford due process and fair procedures to any persons who may be the subject of this investigation, and to ensure that the outcome of the investigation or any follow up action that may arise as a result of it are not prejudiced in any way, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further at this point.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Following an open tender competition in which 370 tenders were received, I announced in June details of the first call of the Labour Market Activation Fund to support 26 different organisations across the private, not-for-profit and public sectors.  On 5th August, I announced the allocation of an additional €12 million to the Fund, raising it to €32 million in all. This has enabled my Department to offer funding to 33 additional projects from a range of private and public training and education providers. This will bring to almost 60 the number of projects throughout the country being supported by the Labour Market Activation Fund.  To-date approximately €8.4m has been drawn down by successful tenderers.The target of 3,500 participants relates to the first tranche of funding provided to successful tenderers.  While virtually all of these projects are now up and running, reports on progress including participant numbers are not yet available.  I do however, anticipate that this target will be attained.  A number of programmes from the second tranche of funding are still in the process of recruiting participants. Until all programmes are up and running it is extremely difficult to assess accurately the exact number of participants that have benefited from the fund.

This will involve an expert Group to be known as the Second-Level Patronage Advisory Group that will consider applications for new schools and advise me in relation to those applications. The Group will undertake survey work of parental views and use the criteria to be set down.In relation to the new second level school to be established in Gorey, Co. Wexford, I have advanced a process where it is anticipated that a decision on patronage will be made by the end of October or early November 2010.There have been two expressions of interest from prospective patron bodies who want to manage the new school, namely County Wexford VEC and Educate Together.  The process currently underway involves a survey of the views of parents of primary and pre-primary children in the Gorey area and an assessment of the applications from the prospective patrons against the criteria set out for the establishment of new post-primary schools.  I will consider the outcome of the survey, while having regard to the general criteria set out as part of my recent announcement on the new framework, in making my decision on the patronage of the new school.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	430	FÁS provides a range of training initiatives for the unemployed including those in receipt of jobseekers allowance. The budget for 2010 for these programmes is €296 million.In addition to this the Labour Market Activation Fund, launched earlier this  year and administered by my Department, provides training and education  programmes delivered by a range of providers for those who are unemployed and  wish to improve their education and skills and move closer to the labour  market.  The 2010 Budget for this fund amounts to €31.7 million.Finally, the 2010 Training Networks Programme (TNP) administered by Skillnets Limited, the body charged with the promotion and facilitation of enterprise-led training of persons in employment, has been expanded to include an element of  training of unemployed persons. In September of this year, Skillnets Limited issued a call for proposals for a pilot programme of training networks to be comprised solely of unemployed persons.  A budget of up to €2.5m has been provided within the TNP allocation for the training of unemployed persons.In regard to the qualifications awarded, funding is made available for programmes that are accredited up to and including FETAC level 6 or its equivalent within the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). The majority of courses provided are accredited, however where the need arises funding is made available for courses that are not accredited.

However, all proposals made in relation to education  expenditure will be considered in the context of the Budget.With regard to the other issues raised by the Deputy, as a measure to support  unemployed graduates and in order to keep them close to the labour market, the  Government introduced the Work Placement Programme (WPP) in 2009.The WPP is operated by the Department of Education and Skills, through FÁS and  provides up to 9 months work experience to unemployed individuals. The WPP is  open to all sectors of the economy, including the private and public sectors,  as well as the community and voluntary sectors.  Participants on the programme  may retain their existing social welfare entitlements for the duration of their  placements subject to the rules of the Department of Social Protection.At the start of October 2010, some 2,022 individuals had commenced their  placements under the WPP. Of these, 996 individuals have commenced on the  graduate stream.FAS recently attended the Graduate Fair in the RDS and the WPP received  significant interest from graduates and was viewed as an opportunity to gain  valuable work experience that would be beneficial to them and to their  employment prospects.The Government through the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal are currently  considering proposals to assist the unemployed, including graduates in advance  of Budget 2011.

Overall post-primary requirements in the area referred to by the Deputy, including the case for the provision of a new Irish language post-primary school, will be considered in this context.In addition to this I have recently announced the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their patronage. This will involve an expert Group to be known as the Second-Level Patronage Advisory Group that will consider applications for new schools and advise me in relation to those applications, having undertaken survey work of parental views and using the criteria to be set down.The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.The NCSE is committed to exercising its role in relation to the allocation of teaching hours and Special Needs Assistants to schools to support the education of children with special educational needs in a way that is fair, consistent and transparent. The NCSE has introduced an appeals procedure which can now be viewed in full on its website —www.ncse.ie.I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	436	National in-service programmes are made freely available to all teachers nationwide and all teachers can also avail of elective courses delivered through the local education centre. Teachers are also able to attend courses in other locations in the national network of education centres.In relation to national in-service programmes, seminars and workshops are generally offered to all teachers in the relevant sector or who are involved in teaching the subject/programme in question. Such seminars are often related to curricular change but they can also be associated with other system priorities, some recent examples of which include child protection guidelines and English as an additional language.There is no set number of annual training days. The amount of training offered to teachers in any given year will depend on the programmes of professional development that are in place at that time, and the target cohort of teachers. For example, when current Primary School Curriculum was introduced some 10 years ago, all primary teachers were offered 6/7 days of in-service training per year as the curriculum was implemented. In the current school term at post-primary level, for example, teachers are being invited to professional development workshops with the Project Maths Development Team and the Second Level Support Service for Irish.The number of days training a teacher receives on an annual basis depends on an individual teacher availing of the professional development opportunities that are relevant to his/her post or area of expertise.Apart from the national roll-out of programmes associated with curricular change as outlined above, support services also aim to enable schools to become more self-sufficient in their own improvement and development, by responding to schools' and teachers' self-identified development needs.  This may involve support advisors visiting a school, or small cluster of schools, and facilitating development sessions on a whole-school or smaller group basis. The quantity of such support availed of by a particular school will depend on whether the school has requested support, the nature of the support and on the capacity of the support service to respond to the need in question.In County Meath, Navan Education Centre — one of 21 such full-time Centres throughout the country — provides support for teachers, schools, principals, Boards of Management and allied school personnel in counties Meath and Louth. The region has over 210 schools, both primary and post primary. Navan also gives professional ICT support to the schools and teachers of Co Cavan. In total the centre supports in the region of 4,000 teachers and allied school personnel. The Centre is the main venue for the majority of national in-service seminars for teachers from Meath, and it also provides a wide range of elective events for teachers, parents and boards of management in the Meath area.  The Centre devises its own programme of elective courses, which is informed by the policies and priorities of the Department of Education and Skills, as well ongoing communication with schools in its catchment area.The following table outlines the number of local professional development events that have been organised by Navan Education Centre from 2004 to 2009. Participants in these events include primary and post primary teachers and other school personnel. In relation to school building, a further table set out below outlines details of major capital works on new school buildings, extensions and refurbishments completed since 2002, as well as the capital projects currently underway or at tendering stage, in County Meath.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Information requested by the Deputy in respect of the number of staff from my Department who have left under the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER), those who left for other reasons, new recruits and number of promotions is in Table 1. I have not included staff who left the Department as a result of decentralisation through the Central Applications Facility (CAF) or under the Dublin Arrangements as these were, for the most part, replaced.It is not possible to accurately calculate net savings arising from staff leaving over and above those recruited and promoted as there are many other factors which affect the payroll outturn including the timing of departures and replacement, timing of recruitment and/or promotions, staff being replaced by others on different starting salary points, staff returning/going on career breaks, changes to work sharing arrangements etc. In addition, when staff of this Department leave under the levy to the Department of Social Protection, their salary transfers with them. There was also a salary adjustment made to my Department's administrative budget when 31 staff transferred to this Department as a result of certain responsibilities transferring here from Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, including responsibility for Skills and Training policy and for FÁS. The corresponding staff/sections transferred to this Department with effect from 1st May, 2010.  I have however included the salary outturn for this Department for 2008, 2009 and the estimated outturn for 2010 in Table 2.In terms of the wider Education sector, details in relation to staff who availed of the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER) from Third Level institutions and from the Vocational Education Committees (VEC) is in Table 3.Third Level institutions report on their overall staffing numbers to my Department on a quarterly basis in the context of my Department's overall control of public sector numbers. Aggregate figures that are provided by the institutions show that, since the introduction of the Employment Control Framework (ECF), the total number of whole time equivalent staff employed in the sector has decreased from 21,149 at 31 December, 2008 to 19,819 at 30 June, 2010: a reduction of 1,330 or 6.29% in whole-time equivalents. Matters in relation to staff departures, recruitment and promotions are a matter for each institution. Each institution is subject to the ECF which has been developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements on recruitment and promotion to higher education institutions.VEC's report on their overall staffing numbers to my Department in the context of control of public sector numbers, however matters in relation to staff departures, recruitment and promotions are a matter for each VEC subject to the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the Public Service.The Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER) for public servants over 50 years of age, did not apply to certain school staff including teachers and special needs assistants. Primary and post-primary teachers are not subject to the moratorium on recruitment which applies to most other parts of the public service and so retiring teachers are, in most cases, replaced. The ISER was aimed at civil and public servants who retired before the age of 60 and whose superannuation options were limited to receiving their entitlements at preserved pension age or, for people aged over 50, immediate payment of pension benefits subject to an actuarial reduction. Under the 55/35 year rule a teacher, other than a new entrant appointed after 1 April 2004, who has reached the age of 55 years and has at least 35 years of actual pensionable service, may retire voluntarily. There is no actuarial reduction in benefits and credit for certain pre-service training is given in order to assist teachers to reach the 35-year threshold for retirement. The other information requested by the Deputy, in respect of teachers, is not readily available and would take an inordinate amount of time to compile.Information in relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department is currently being compiled by my Department and I will forward it to you in due course.2010Left ISEROther Reasons*Promoted toNew StaffSecretary GeneralAssistant Secretary General111DirectorPrincipal Officer2Assistant Principal Officer3Higher Executive Officer41Executive Officer6Staff Officer21Clerical62Psychologist27Divisional Inspector1Senior Psychologist2District Inspector1Cleaner1Services Officer1Chief Inspector1Deputy Chief Inspector11Director of NEPS1Total132349SubheadA.1.2 Dept.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	439	The Deputy will be aware that, in line with the Transforming Public Services agenda, it is intended that the student grants administration process will be streamlined to create one consolidated student grant scheme to be administered by a single grant awarding authority. The main objective of this reform of the administrative arrangements is to bring about greater simplicity and efficiency to the system.  The new administrative arrangements will be fully customer focused to ensure the efficient and timely delivery of grants to those students who demonstrate an entitlement.The Student Support Bill, due to progress to Committee Stage shortly, will provide an enabling legislative framework for the provision of all student grants, facilitating the creation of the single consolidated grants scheme and underpinning the reform and streamlining of administration procedures for the management of the grant awarding process.This reform programme has the potential to deliver a significant service enhancement benefit to student grant applicants through streamlined processes, greater consistency in dealing with applications, faster processing due to economies of scale and full implementation of the on-line applications system introduced in September 2010.It is anticipated that it will also deliver substantial administrative cost savings beyond the initial transitional phase in both the assessment/award function at grant awarding authority level and in administrative inputs at college level.  The extent of savings in each area will depend on the implementation mechanisms to be agreed following selection of the single grant awarding authority.

The institutions approved under the scheme are, generally speaking, publicly-funded third level colleges offering full-time courses at undergraduate and post-graduate level.  Each year, the Higher Education Grants Scheme specifies a list of institutions approved for the purposes of the scheme.My Department provides very significant funding to publicly-funded third level institutions in the State. This funding is used to provide a very broad range of courses to meet both economic and societal needs.  Private commercial colleges, in general, operate on a "for profit" basis and the State has no say in directing their operations.I have no plans to extend the scope of the student grant schemes to private colleges operated on a "for profit" basis at this time and I am not aware of any relevant High Court ruling in this regard.

Such arrangements can include having an agreement in place with at least 2  other providers, to enable learners to transfer to continue their programmes  should the provider cease operation.FETAC is examining the protection for learners arrangements in place for the  organisation referred to by the Deputy and will facilitate the transfer of  learners as soon as learner enrolment information becomes available. FETAC is  also in the process of identifying a range of providers to assist in assessing  and certifying learners' work that has already been completed.FETAC also intends to establish the number of learners enrolled on short  programmes (i.e. programmes less than three months in duration) with a view to  putting in place arrangements to enable those learners to complete their  programmes wherever possible.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil's area. I understand the NEWB have been in contact with the parents of the student in question on the matter.The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.I can confirm that home tuition has been sanctioned to the pupil in question with effect from 23rd September 2010 up to 23rd December 2010 on the basis that the pupil does not have a school placement.

The Returns of Income for 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 were only submitted to Revenue in November 2009, which is past the dates on which these Returns should have been made.  As a result of the late submission of these returns, statutory surcharges were applied in accordance with the relevant legislation, which is contained in Section 1084, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.   No refunds are due for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. This taxpayer did make an overpayment of tax for 2002. However, no refund can be made for 2002 because a statutory based 4-year time limit applies to all such repayment claims.This taxpayer submitted his Return of Income for 2006 to Revenue in March 2010. This 2006 return should have been made on the 31st October 2007, and again, since this return was made late a surcharge was applied in accordance with the relevant legislationThe information supplied on the Returns of Income formed the basis for the Notices of Assessment issued to him by Revenue.

The legislation will be consistent with the requirements for the measures to be recognised as a re-organisation under the relevant EU Directive in other EU Member States.The process to provide the necessary legislation is being actively pursued.For the information of the Deputy Anglo Irish Bank have taken steps to pursue a voluntary burden sharing arrangement with its subordinated bondholders. The bank has announced a liability management exercise to exchange and redeem subordinated bonds at a sharp discount. This exercise is a necessary step for Anglo in light of their EU-required restructuring and ensures that Anglo's subordinated bondholders have an immediate share in Anglo's losses. This is entirely consistent with the Government's intention that subordinated bondholders shall make a significant contribution to the costs of Anglo Irish.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	449	As the Deputy is aware I indicated in my statement of 30th September 2010 that the position is that senior debt obligations of financial institutions rank equally with deposits and other creditors under Irish law. I indicated that I have no plans to change this position.  I confirmed this position in a statement on 7th October 2010 a week later. In the absence of a subordination agreement, where a financial institution is being wound up the principle that applies is pari passu, meaning all unsecured creditors have equal ranking to be repaid by the financial institution. So, where there is a shortfall in assets all unsecured creditors are entitled to an equal dividend of X cent in the euro. This is subject to the contractual terms of the senior debt, not providing otherwise i.e. subordinating their liability to depositors. The principle of creditor equality is also enshrined in the Credit Institutions Winding Up Directive 2001/17/EC.In the context of a company that is continuing in business as a going concern the principle of pari passu does not apply although the effect is similar.  Where a company has debts, it is liable to pay those debts and each debtor has an equal right to be repaid whether that person's debt arises on foot of a bond or a deposit. In either case the terms of the repayment will obviously be determined by the instrument creating or evidencing the debt — repayable on demand or at a certain future time. I would add that the principle of equal entitlement to be repaid their debts as among unsecured creditors is subject to the absence of one of them being obliged by contract to be postponed in favour of another.It must also be remembered that depositors who suffer a loss in the event of a financial institution being wound up insolvent are entitled to compensation up to a certain amount under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and/or the Eligible Liability Scheme.

In this regard, my Department recently issued new guidelines addressed to public bodies and aimed at facilitating small and medium-sized enterprises in competing for public procurement opportunities.  The guidance sets out positive measures that contracting authorities are required to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime.  The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  Some of the key features of the guidance include:Contracts for supplies and general services with an estimated value of EUR25,000 or more are now to be advertised on the www.etenders.gov.ie website.Limitation on the use of ‘restrictive procedure' tendering and increased use of ‘open procedure' tendering;Much of the documentary evidence of a tenderer's capacity to undertake a project should no longer be sought  until the tenderer is shortlisted or being considered for the award of a contract; andContracting authorities are required to ensure that the levels they set for suitability criteria must be   justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.Measures such as these will increase the opportunities for SMEs to compete for public contracts and will reduce the up-front administration burden for them.In regard to large orders, the guidance promotes sub-dividing requirements into lots as this clearly facilitates access by SMEs.  This approach is to be considered by contracting authorities where it would be appropriate and practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.The guidance also provides that in establishing framework agreements, contracting authorities are to consider how proposed arrangements will impact on SMEs.  They are required to ensure that the terms of the framework facilitate the inclusion of smaller enterprises if these can meet requirements or compete for particular lots.  Also smaller companies can combine with others to make a joint bid for a contract that they might not be in a position to perform on their own.There will be instances where SMEs flexibility and ability to respond speedily to requirements could place such enterprises in a particularly favourable position to participate and compete effectively.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	452	Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides, subject to certain conditions, for tax relief at the standard rate of income tax (20%) as regards qualifying fees paid by an individual in respect of a third level education course including a postgraduate course.  Qualifying fees means tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college.  The maximum limit on such qualifying fees for the current academic year is €5,000 @ 20% (i.e the standard rate of income tax).The tax relief is confined to tuition fees only and does not extend to items such as registration fees, administration fees, accommodation, etc.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, employer contribution or by other means are to be deducted in arriving at the net fees qualifying for tax relief.As the Deputy will be aware, the State provides for free tuition fees for the majority of undergraduate courses. Therefore the State already commits large scale Exchequer resources towards the availability of third-level education.Based on figures provided by the Department of Education and Skills on the amount of college registration fees paid in 2009, net of higher education grants, the estimated full year cost to the Exchequer of providing tax relief in respect of such fees at the standard rate of income tax (20%) would be of the order of €24 million.

No breakdown is available of employer contributions which would allow for such contributions to be associated with employee/personal contributions on a case-by-case basis.Furthermore, a breakdown of the figures by reference to income levels is available only in respect of the tax relief for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) to the extent that these contributions are included in the personal tax returns of taxpayers.With regard to occupational pensions (that is, schemes set up by the employer) the figures in respect of employee contributions are available only in aggregate form. Information on such contributions is not captured in such a way as to make it possible to associate contributions with individual income levels. For that reason the estimated yields to the Exchequer provided in respect of these contributions are extremely tentative.

I am informed that Anglo has initiated a detailed review which has thus far indicated that, prior to July 2004, a significant number of instances of this issue occurred where the interest rates applying to certain loans were not in accordance with the customer loan documentation. The review has determined that this practice ceased in 2004.As outlined in the Interim accounts it is not possible for the bank to be definitive on the number of instances or the amount at issue because the review will take up to 12 months to complete given the extensive volume of documentation which needs to be examined.The bank has informed me that an internal Steering Group has been established to investigate the issue in detail. The Steering Group reports to the CEO and Board Risk Committee. Its work will be independently reviewed and verified by external accountants. In addition to determining with detailed accuracy the amounts relating to affected corporate borrowers, the Steering Group is investigating what happened, how this happened and where responsibility lies.Both my Department and the Central Bank were notified as soon as this issue came to light. The Central Bank is being briefed on the review as it progresses.As the review progresses, the Bank will communicate with all customers impacted and will ensure that redress, where appropriate, takes place. The bank has informed me that customers can contact their relationship manager for information.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	457	Under Section 22 of the Adoption Act 1952, an tArd Chláraitheoir (Registrar General) is required to maintain a register of domestic adoptions (i.e. adoptions effected in Ireland, regardless of where the adopted person was born).  The register is called the Adopted Children Register.  An index to the register is maintained and can be searched by any person.  Any person may obtain a copy of any entry in the register.  The legislation also provides for an index linking the birth entry in the register of births (in the case of an Irish-born adopted person) with the entry in the Adopted Children Register.  Information from this index may not be given to any person except by order of a court or the Adoption Board. It is a matter for the Adoption Board, which is an independent quasi judicial body, to treat each application it receives in this regard on its individual merits. I understand that the Adoption Board does release original birth certificates to adopted people and that while in certain cases, an application may be refused by the Board due to the specific circumstances of the case,  in the majority of cases the application for the release of the birth certificate is successful.The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.The Adoption Board, together with the adoption societies, the HSE and the support groups, developed the "Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Information and Tracing Service".  This framework was published in November 2007. It sets standards and provides guidance and advice for information and tracing services providers nationally. The standardised Framework is currently being piloted nationally. In relation to Information and Tracing for persons adopted from abroad, the Adoption Board is undertaking a process, with Romanian authorities initially, to determine how best to address the needs of those adopted from abroad.The Information and Tracing Unit in the Adoption Board also provides an advice and referral service for those seeking to trace or to obtain medical or personal information. This unit provides services directly to adopted people, natural mothers and birth families.  It works closely with the registered adoption societies and the HSE nationwide information and tracing services.The drafting of legislation with regard to Information and Tracing is a priority of mine and work has commenced in relation to the preparation of the Bill, in consultation with the Adoption Board.

This applies to the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer or for supply to mass caterers.  The principle underlying this Directive is that the purchaser must not be misled and it has helped to ensure that the consumer is provided with the information required to make healthy consumption choices.  In January 2008, the European Commission presented its proposals on updating and harmonising this legislation. The proposal is still under discussion. This proposal envisages the consolidation of existing legislation in the area of food labelling and the introduction of new provisions for Country of Origin Labelling, a mandatory nutrition declaration and allergen labelling, amongst others.In November 2008, Ireland submitted its position paper on the proposal. This paper was informed by submissions made to the FSAI by many of the key stakeholders.  Ireland's position was further informed by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland 2009 labelling survey.In its position paper, Irelandsupports mandatory Country of Origin Labelling,shares the concerns of a significant number of other member states with regard  to National Schemes,welcomes the proposal for mandatory allergen labelling and supports the highlighting of allergens on labels,supports the equal treatment of all alcohol products,asks that consideration should be given to bringing alcohol products into the scope of the legislation,supports the retention of the Commission's proposal with regard to the use of "per portion" expression alone in certain cases, anddoes not support the proposal for a minimum font size of 3mm for display of mandatory particulars and suggests that other aids to legibility, such as contrasting background, be explored.  Since January 2008 a number of meetings have taken place at European Union Working Group level, attended by officials from Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and are still ongoing.  Parliament conducted its first reading of the document in June 2010. It is now expected that the proposal will be finalised during 2011. This will then be transposed into Irish Law.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 94, 97 and 108 together.Under the provisions of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, the Health Service Executive appointed an external service provider to act as Scheme Administrator for the Health Repayment Scheme.  The service provider is a consortium comprising of  KPMG Accountants and McCann Fitzgerald Solicitors.As per the contract agreement with the Scheme Administrator the HSE make payments to the consortium on foot of invoices received from KPMG Accountants and payments are payable to KPMG Accountants on behalf of the consortium.A total of €15.2m (inc VAT)  has been paid to the Scheme Administrator since the commencement of the scheme in August 2006 and this amount is within the contract price agreed at the commencement of the scheme.35,405 application forms have been received under the Health Repayment Scheme.  Of the applications received under the scheme, it is estimated that the number of valid claims will be approximately 21,400.To date 35,390 or 99% of applications have been concluded. 21,375 claimants have received an offer of repayment and the value of these offers is €440m.  A further 14,015 applications have been rejected under the scheme.The main reasons for the rejection of claims are as follows:Person resided in a long stay facility that falls outside the ambit of the scheme.Person did not pay recoverable health charges as per the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.Duplicate claims received by the Scheme Administrator.Person died before the 9th December 1998.Claim withdrawn.The cost of the Health Repayment Scheme to date is €462.4m.

The current average time between the receipt of a completed Appeal Form and the making of an Appeals Officer's decision is 174 working days.  However the time taken in any individual case depends on the complexity of that case.  It is anticipated that the majority of appeals will be determined by early 2011.

The Council sets education standards and conducts examinations leading to the National Qualification in Emergency Medical Technology (NQEMT).The current Council guidelines are contained in the Education and Training Standards 2007.  The Guidelines set out the following minimum entry criteria:For the emergency medical technician course, candidates must be aged eighteen or over.For the paramedic course, candidates must be eighteen or over and educated to leaving certificate or equivalent standard.For the advanced paramedic course, candidates must have been registered paramedics for at least three years.Recognised training institutions may have their own criteria in addition to the above requirements.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I understand that the four child care services referred to by the Deputy have been in receipt of support funding from the Health Service Executive (HSE) for a number of years, to assist them to provide affordable child care and early intervention services to disadvantaged parents and their children including catering for a significant number of child referrals from the HSE and community welfare officers.  In 2010, I understand that this will exceed €1 million.In recent years, a number of major child care investment programmes which fund preschool services, in particular community services such as the four referred to, have been implemented by my Office.  These include the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which was introduced in January 2010 and the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme which was first introduced in January 2008 and amended and improved in September 2010.In most cases, these schemes now provide the principal source of support funding for preschool services including community child care services catering for disadvantaged and low income parents.  However, my understanding is that services which meet particular social needs, such as those referred to by the Deputy, will continue to be considered for additional annual funding from the HSE.  An official from my Office recently attended a meeting arranged by the HSE with representatives of the services to discuss their future funding and to clarify the position.Only one of the services referred to is currently participating in the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) scheme but I believe all four are expected to participate in the scheme from January 2011.  With regard to the service participating in the CCS, as it has not yet made a service return to my Office for September 2010/August 2011, I am unable to confirm the amount of CCS funding it will receive.  However, I understand it received a payment of €26,563 for the period January to August 2010.  All four of the services applied for and entered the ECCE scheme with effect from January 2010.  For the September 2010 to August 2011 preschool year they have received preliminary ECCE payments totalling €82,488 and balancing payments for the first term will issue shortly.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I remain committed to providing the best standard of complex hospital care for children in Ireland and I am confident that this objective will be met.The National Paediatric Development Board has commenced the planning process for the new hospital directly with An Bord Pleanála on 11 October 2010 and the completion date for construction of the hospital is the last quarter of 2014.I have every confidence in the National Paediatric Board and its new Chairman who has experience and expertise in the areas of project delivery and also philanthropic funding and that the Board will press ahead with work on the development. The new children's hospital will play a central role in an integrated network of paediatric services across Ireland. This development will fundamentally change and improve the provision of paediatric health care in Ireland because merging the three existing hospitals (at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght) into a single hospital structure will ensure a critical mass of specialised skills to provide highly complex treatment and care to sick children. The decision to provide ambulatory and emergency care services at Tallaght is based on recommendations made in the reports of McKinsey and Co (2006) and international health service consultants, RKW (2007).The Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght will provide emergency and elective ambulatory health care services to the local population. It will also provide day care services (both medical and surgical) through 28 day care beds, 3 operating theatres and 2 procedure rooms. Outpatient services will be provided through 26 consulting examination rooms. The Urgent Care Centre will also provide emergency care services for the local population of children.  It is expected that the centre will be completed before the end of 2013.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	471	Dementia is a most distressing condition both for those suffering from it and their families, and presents a significant and growing challenge to health and social services.  Alzheimer's disease represents about 70% of the cases of dementia.Research and published work on dementia has outlined the complexity and range of issues involved in the effective management of dementia. This work also emphasises the need for co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services, which are responsive to the individual needs of people with dementia and of those who care for them.Over the past number of years there has been continued development of community-based services for older persons. This is reflected in the unprecedented levels of investment in this sector — over €200 million additional funding has been provided for new service developments in recent years. These developments include community nursing, paramedical services, home help services and support to family carers.As I have indicated previously, my Department has started the process of developing a policy on dementia that will support the delivery of long-term care services having regard to future demographic trends and the consequential increase in demand for long-term care.  This policy will be developed on the basis of the best evidence available from national and international sources. Officials in the Department have consulted with relevant stakeholder groups on the first stage of the process. This will be a research phase to include relevant information on current prevalence and future trends in dementia, as well as international strategies and developments, including their outcomes and evaluations.The Health Service Executive (HSE) is currently exploring the potential for changes in care pathways for people with dementia, and will make recommendations for the future provision of dementia care across all health and social services. An audit is underway within the HSE of the current specialist dementia care services available both in residential/hospital and community services. This audit will inform future planning and development of services for people with dementia.  The educational needs of staff will also be identified to inform any future staff requirements for working in the area of dementia care. This work will also feed into the overall Dementia Policy formulation.The Deputy's question also relates to service matters which is a matter for the HSE.  Accordingly this has been referred to the Executive for direct reply.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	473	The Form of Agreement with General Practitioners (GPs) for the provision of services under the General Medical Services (GMS) contract outlines the minimum standards required in terms of practice facilities.  This includes:(a) A waiting room with a reasonable standard of comfort and hygiene, sufficient in size to accommodate the normal demands of the practice with adequate seating accommodation.(b) A surgery sufficient in size for the requirements of normal general practice, with appropriate facilities.While the contract sets a minimum standard to be observed by contractors, the standard of practice premises in general has improved considerably since the contract was introduced, through investment in practice infrastructure.  There is also a requirement for GP surgeries to comply with statutory obligations in the area of planning permission and fire certification in respect of the defined usage.  The surgeries are also obliged to comply with Building Regulations governing a wide range of construction and operational matters.  Compliance with the Disability Act in the context of access and functional operation of premises is also required.There has also been significant investment in enhancing treatment facilities for GP out-of-hours services over the past number of years.  The commitment to continuously improve the quality of primary care facilities is also very much in evidence in the new primary care centres, which are being developed throughout the country as part of the development and roll out of primary care teams.

The terms and conditions of the scheme are governed by Department of Finance Circular 12/2009. The purpose of the scheme is to facilitate the permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the civil service, local authorities, health sector and non-commercial state bodies, with associated restructuring of organisation and operations, in as timely a manner as possible.Employees, 50 years of age and over by 1 September 2009 who had already accrued entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits under a public service scheme and who had not yet reached normal preserved pension age were eligible to apply for retirement under the scheme. The scheme was open to applications from 1 May 2009 until 23 October 2009. No categories of staff employed at my Department were excluded from applying under the scheme.  In my Department, twenty eight members of staff applied and were approved under the scheme. Two of these subsequently withdrew their applications, resulting in twenty six retirements under the scheme (23.23 WTE).In relation to the Health Service Executive, the terms and conditions of the ISER scheme were set out in Circular 8/2009 issued by my Department on 15 May 2009. This scheme did not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector  in order to meet relevant requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.   Members of all other grades who met the eligibility criteria  had access to this scheme provided the grades/staff groups concerned co-operated with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility. Because staff who availed of this scheme were not to be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers paid particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that existed within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard was essential.  The closing date for applications was 23 October 2009.My Department was informed that the health service trade unions had issued a directive instructing their members not to co-operate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  This instruction from the unions severely restricted the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravened the qualification criteria for these schemes.  As a result, the HSE suspended the ISER scheme on 18 June 2009.In February 2010 sanction was received from the Department of Finance for the implementation of the ISER in the public health sector for those applicants (employed in both the HSE and in voluntary service providers funded by it) who applied before the final closing date (23 October 2009) under the scheme and who were or would be approved under its terms. The HSE has advised that at the end of August there have been 633 applications and 260 of these have been approved.  My Department has recently informed the HSE that a review of eligible applications which were refused/refused on appeal for stated business reasons may now take place.  Reviews must be completed and all decisions communicated no later than 31 December 2010 and applicants approved under this process must retire no later than 31 January 2011.  In relation to the non-commercial state agencies that come within the remit of my Department, one application was received and approved under the Incentivised Early Retirement Scheme.

The terms and conditions of the Scheme are governed by Department of Finance Circular 13/2009.  To avail of this scheme, a career break of special leave without pay had to be taken for three years. The scheme provides for the payment of one third of gross pay to a maximum of €12,500 per annum to successful applicants. These amounts are reduced pro rata for any person on reduced working hours under worksharing arrangements and the amount payable is subject to tax and other statutory deductions.  To-date, 10.5 wholetime equivalents (13 individuals) from my Department have availed of the Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme.In relation to the Health Service Executive, the terms and conditions of the Special Incentive Career Break Scheme were set out in Circular 13/2009 issued by my Department on 15 May 2009. This scheme, along with the Incentivised Early Retirement Scheme and the Shorter Working Year Scheme did not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector.Members of all other grades who met the eligibility criteria  had access to these schemes provided the grades/staff groups concerned co-operated with relevant requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility.

This instruction from the unions severely restricted the ability of management to organise/restructure work practices and contravened the qualification criteria for these schemes.  As a result, the HSE suspended all three schemes on 18 June 2009.  Following acceptance by the health sector unions of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, approval was given to the HSE by my Department in June 2010 to proceed with the lifting of the suspension of the scheme.  Applicants, employed both in the HSE and in the voluntary service providers funded by it, who had applied before the original closing date of 1st July 2009 and were, or would have been approved prior to the scheme's suspension, could now be fully processed.My Department has recently informed the HSE that a review of eligible applications which were refused/refused on appeal may now take place.  Reviews must be completed and all decisions communicated no later than 31 December 2010 and applicants approved under this process must retire no later than 31 January 2011.

The purpose of the scheme is to permit civil servants to balance their working arrangements with outside commitments by taking periods of unpaid leave.  The specific terms and conditions of the Scheme are governed by Department of Finance Circular 14/2009 and it provides for the taking of unpaid leave as a period of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 13 weeks (a maximum of 13 weeks applies per person). Any staff member, who is not on probation on the date where it is proposed to avail of the scheme, may apply.  Forty-five staff members from my Department have applied to-date under the scheme and all bar one request was approved resulting in payroll savings of approximately €280,000 during 2010.In relation to the Health Service Executive, the terms and conditions of the scheme are set out in Circular 10/2009 issued by my Department on 15 May 2009.

The position generally in respect of the matter raised by the Deputy is as follows.Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956-2004 provides that a person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years.  The section does not apply to certain persons including those born to parents one of whom is at the time of the person's birth an Irish citizen, British citizen or a person entitled to reside without restriction. For the purpose of calculating reckonable residence under section 6A certain residence is excluded from consideration including unlawful residence, residence covered by a permission granted under Section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004 for the purpose of study and residence covered by a provisional permission granted pending determination of an asylum application.Parents may apply for a passport for a child to the Passport Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs on the basis that the child may have an entitlement to Irish citizenship. The Passport Office makes an assessment of the parent's reckonable residency through an examination of their permission stamps. If the parents do not have sufficient residency and the child does not have an entitlement to citizenship, then it will be open to the parent of the child to make  an application for a certificate of naturalisation  on their  behalf under section 15 of the Act, when the child has 5 years reckonable residency in the State.

Provisional indications are that burglaries involving jewellery are running at levels similar to last year. Garda management is aware that a number of outlets have been established in various areas that are buying gold for cash. A number of established jewellers are also buying gold and jewellery for cash.While the informal purchase of jewellery and precious items is not specifically regulated, the circumstances under which they are bought or sold may indicate the commission of certain offences. For example the handling of stolen property and or the possession of stolen property, which are offences under sections 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 respectively, may be indicated through the specific circumstances under which transactions are effected. There is an onus, under the law, on the owners of the business in question to ensure that they are not buying stolen goods.  If members of the public have suspicions that goods being sold or traded may have been stolen, the correct action is for these suspicions to be referred to An Garda Síochána for investigation.I wish to advise the Deputy that neither my Department nor An Garda Síochána haveany function in relation to the regulation of legal transactions in jewellery and gold. Furthermore the informal purchase of jewellery and gold is not specifically regulated in criminal legislation.

She was afforded three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons  why she should not be deported.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.The person concerned is illegally present in the State and, as such, she has no entitlement to work or reside here.  Her marital status is also being investigated.The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

Under this system, asylum seeker residents are provided with full board accommodation free of utility or other cost. At the end of September, 2010 a total of 47 centres throughout the country accommodating 6,288 persons seeking international protection were under contract to the RIA.In meeting its general accommodation responsibilities, RIA does not lease or rent premises from commercial contractors.  Rather it "contracts-in" a comprehensive range of services, which include accommodation, catering, management, housekeeping, laundry, etc, for a fixed period of time.In managing this process, RIA has advertised annually in the national press for expressions of interest from persons interested in providing accommodation and ancillary services for asylum seekers.  No newcomers are prevented from coming into the market.  In procuring direct provision accommodation and ancillary facilities, specific regard is had to the following:Type of accommodation being offered (hotel, guest house, hostel etc.);Location;Local population and numbers of asylum seekers, if any, already residing in the area;Local infrastructure (transport, schools, hospitals, shops etc.);Facilities being offered by proprietor ( recreation, communal rooms, en-suites, etc.);Facilities for other Government agencies (HSE, Refugee Legal Services etc.).RIA endeavours to achieve both best value for money and as even a spread as possible of asylum seekers throughout the country and, in its procurement process, negotiations can take place with a number of commercial entities.   The Deputy will be aware that I have recently presented to the Oireachtas Library a copy of the Value For Money (VFM) review in respect of spending by RIA on asylum seeker accommodation.  The report can also be viewed on the RIA website: www.ria.gov.ie. The review group had a steering committee, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and an independent Chairperson.  This report made a detailed examination of RIA’s procurement function. That report is undergoing a detailed analysis in RIA having regard to the Review Group’s own acknowledgement of the unique challenges in this particular area of procurement — unpredictability of demand, dispersal, local opposition, children settled in schools and so on.It is important to point out that RIA constantly engages with its contractors to ensure that value for money is being achieved and that the contractor is complying with standards of accommodation, bed-usage, health and safety etc. as set out in the contract and in other legal provisions.The RIA monitors this service delivery using a number of tools, including:RIA (internal) Inspections Unit visits (minimum of 2 per centre per year);Independent Inspections by a commercial firm, QTS limited, under contract to RIA (minimum of 1 per centre per year);Examination of resident register returns, including trends in "attendance" (weekly at RIA);RIA Information Clinics (one-to-one with residents)  (minimum of 2 per centre per year);On-the-spot visits by RIA officers;Bed-Audit Reviews (targeting contract compliance and bed usage).The current contract details are in the following table:LocationCapacityContract Ends

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	513	The Department of Foreign Affairs learned on the morning of Monday 11 October that a group of 31 Irish citizens, including members of the Killester United Football Club, had been refused entry to Brazil by the Immigration authorities at Sao Paolo.  Having been advised of the problem at immigration, our Embassy in Brazil immediately contacted the Immigration service in Sao Paulo to ascertain why this group had been refused entry.  The Embassy was informed by the Brazilian authorities that the decision to refuse entry was based on an alleged incident involving two members of the group and two Brazilian citizens during the Iberia flight from Madrid to Sao Paulo. It is understood that on landing in Sao Paulo, the Brazilian citizens lodged a formal complaint with the Military Police at the airport who are responsible for immigration control and that this complaint was verified by a number of other passengers on the flight. The Embassy was informed that the decision to refuse entry was based on this complaint and its subsequent verification.The Embassy made representations on behalf of the group to the Immigration authorities in both Sao Paulo and Brasilia and also made contact with the Brazilian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to seek assistance to resolve the issue.  The Embassy sought to secure entry to Brazil, at the very least for those members of the group not directly related to the alleged incident.  I am informed that our Embassy received support in this regard from the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  However, their advice and the Embassy's requests were not accepted by the Immigration authorities and the original decision was upheld.The group, having been refused entry, were obliged to leave Brazil (they were not deported), and returned to Ireland via Madrid.As I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate, the application of Brazilian immigration law is a matter for the Brazilian authorities.  Nevertheless, the Embassy subsequently wrote to the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to indicate that, while respecting their right of the Brazilian authorities to refuse entry to those who may have been involved in the alleged incident, the Embassy nevertheless wished to express our concern at the decision to refuse entry to the remainder of the travelling party.

In the case of retirements, net savings vary depending on the amount of pension and lump sum payable, which in turn depends on length of accrued service.  The pensions and lump sums payable to retiring staff of my Department are calculated by the Department of Finance and paid by the Office of the Paymaster General.I can, however, advise the Deputy that in the period since 27 March 2009, when the current moratorium on recruitment was introduced, the number of staff serving at Assistant Principal Level and higher in the Department has reduced by 29, representing gross annual savings of an estimated €2.5m.  The equivalent number for grades up-to and including Higher Executive Officer level was 35, representing gross annualised savings of some €1.4m.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	515	In considering any changes to social welfare schemes, full consideration is given to the impact of any proposals on the recipients involved.Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.   In the case of persons being cared for at home, the care they receive is usually a balance of support from family and professional help.  The Department of Social Protection provides income supports for family carers while the Department of Health and Children provides professional support.The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.Following this year's Budget, the carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at €239.  The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.   Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.    A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.These levels surpass the "Towards 2016" commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.The professional support provided for people at home is delivered through a range of community services such as home-help, home care packages, meals-on-wheels, and day/respite care. Such supports have the added objectives of reducing inappropriate admissions by older people to acute hospital or long-term residential care.The importance attached to these services is highlighted by the fact that over €200m additional funding has been provided in recent years for these services.  The HSE has responsibility for the delivery of home care services, in line with its National Service Plan 2010. This commits the Executive to provide 12 million home-help hours nationally this year to over 54,000 people. The target for 2010 for home-help hours is unchanged over the 2009 figure. In addition to the mainstream home-help provision, the current plan is designed to deliver home care packages to around 9,600 people at any one time, or to some 13,000 clients over the course of the year, and to cater for the provision of around 21,300 day/respite Care places.In the period 2006 to 2008, over €425m was provided to the HSE under the National Disability Strategy Multi Annual Investment Programme for the provision of additional specialist health and personal social services for people with a disability. In 2009, the HSE provided 3.2 million hours of personal assistant/home care services to people with a disability.In Budget 2010 additional funding of €19.5m was provided to the Executive to respond to demographic growth in demand for emergency residential placements, additional day places, and personal assistant/home support hours. The current HSE Service Plan  commits the Executive to providing the same level of service as in 2009, in other words, 3.2 million hours, and an additional 140,000 hours of personal assistant/home care services for people with a disability.The Government will continue to support carers and the people they care for within the resources available.

The Government is currently examining ways of providing further support to graduate retention in the economy, with policy matters in this area being primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Skills.The main existing employment support mechanism for graduates is the work placement programme administered by FÁS. A key element of the programme is that the customer retains their social welfare entitlement. This facility has also been extended to the IBEC gradlink programme. While on either programme, a person must be genuinely seeking work and must take up an offer of paid employment if one arises.In this way, participants may continue to satisfy the social welfare criteria of being available for and genuinely seeking work. However, if a participant is paid a top-up by their employer this constitutes reckonable earnings from employment. On this basis, they can no longer be considered unemployed. Additionally, in relation to those in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment, such income would fall to be assessed as means.The distinction between employed and unemployed is of crucial importance in the design and administration of any such scheme. Design of a scheme that permits retention of social welfare benefits while a person is in receipt of wages or non-pecuniary emoluments must have cognisance of substitution and replacement effects, while remaining attractive to both interns and hosts. On this basis careful control and demarcation is essential in schemes of this nature.Payments by employers also raise fundamental issues in relation to employment rights, taxation and social insurance. These matters are informing ongoing policy discussions in relation to internships.

The Department operates a network of some 125 local and branch offices throughout the country.  Each local office has officers who are dedicated to providing information and are available to explain supports and services to people.  Information officers provide a range of information to customers on their entitlements including, in broad terms, the effect that taking up work may have on their social welfare payments.  While local office staff have a deep knowledge of social welfare schemes, they may not be in a position to advise customers on the specific financial effect of taking up employment, particularly as it relates to issues such as income tax, income levies or potential in-work benefits.In addition, the Department's network of facilitators work closely with FÁS and other agencies at a local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development opportunities for people.  This locally-based service is supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.  The Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets and these are available in a wide range of outlets, including Social Welfare Offices, Citizens Information Centres and Post Offices.  Leaflets can also be requested through the Department's website.  The Department's website, www.welfare.ie, contains full information on its range of schemes and services, including jobseekers supports, and has a “Frequently Asked Questions” section dedicated to Jobseekers; this section of the site is available in English, Irish and Polish and provides answers to some of the most common queries the Department receives on topics such as taxation of benefits and on options available regarding training, employment, self-employment and voluntary work.Jobseeker customers can now close their claim online and customers doing so are provided with a link to a dedicated page, listing the supports that may be available to them on return to the workforce, such as Family Income Supplement, Money Advice and Budgeting Service, etc.  This page is also linked to from many other relevant pages on the site.Funding is also provided annually to the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed (INOU) to produce their booklet "Working for Work", which contains full information on jobseekers payments, the training and development options available to jobseekers as well as advice on job searching, tax and other social services provided by other Departments and agencies.  INOU provides free copies of the "Working for Work" booklet to people in receipt of social welfare payments.The Citizens Information Board, which comes under the aegis of the Department, is the national information agency with responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information and advice on the broad range of social services including social welfare services.  Information is provided through Citizen Information Centres and other offices throughout the country, through the Citizens Information Phone Service (1890 777 121) which operates from 9am to 9pm Monday to Friday and on their website at www.citizensinformation.ie.  The Citizens Information Board recently launched a new website dedicated to people recently made unemployed, called www.losingyourjob.ie.  This site provides a single point of information for anyone looking for assistance with unemployment or reduced hours.  The Department does not provide a ready-reckoner to customers in order to calculate the financial effect of taking up work.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	537	The Social Insurance Fund (SIF) was established in 1953 following the introduction of the Social Welfare (Insurance) Act of 1952. The main accomplishment of the 1952 Act was the replacement of separate schemes for unemployment, widow's and orphan's pensions, and national health; with a single co-ordinated social insurance scheme.Over the years the social insurance system has developed and improved, both in terms of the types of employments covered and benefits available. Over the course of this development the social insurance system has been based on two fundamental principles — the contributory principle whereby there is a direct link between contributions paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions that are payable as a right and the solidarity principle whereby contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits but are instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable. It is an expression of solidarity between both earning groups and generations.  All current social welfare benefit payments are made from the SIF. Payments made under the redundancy payments acts and the insolvency payments scheme are also made from the fund.In 2009 contributions by employers provided 72.5% of fund income, with employees contributing 21.4%, self-employed contributing 4.3%, and investment income and other receipts amounting to 1.8% of income. Current estimates indicate that 2010 Fund income will be of the order of €6,610 million with expenditure of €9,460 million. An Exchequer subvention to the Fund of €1,970 million is anticipated for 2010.   This will be over €400 million greater than provided for in the estimate, due to lower than expected PRSI receipts.In this context it is important to note that traditionally, social insurance spending has been funded on a tripartite basis — with contributions coming from the Exchequer, employers and employees. Legally, the Exchequer is the residual financier of the fund and exchequer contributions were the norm for over forty years — for example, in 1967, the State contribution was 38% of SIF expenditure and almost 29% in 1985. However, no Exchequer contribution was required between 1996 and 2009 as the fund was in surplus on foot of contributions from employers and workers.The 2005 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which covered the period from 2006 to 2061, highlighted that progressive action is required if future costs, including pensions, are to be met. This will involve finding an appropriate balance between the three strands of the tripartite funding system.Table 1 provides data on the total number of contributors to the SIF together with a breakdown of this figure by PRSI Class type and sets out the benefit coverage relevant to each class. Table 2 provides information on financing of the fund in 2008 and 2009.PRSI ClassCoverageNumbers of contributors insured — 2008MaleFemaleTotalAAll benefits.1,234,0461,163,1522,397,198BWidow’s/Widower’s (Contributory) Pension, Guardian’s Payment (Contributory), Bereavement Grant, Carer’s Benefit & limited Occupational Injuries Benefits.16,40012,02128,421CWidow’s/Widower’s (Contributory) Pension, Guardian’s Payment (Contributory), Bereavement Grant & Carer’s Benefit.745139884DWidow’s/Widower’s (Contributory) Pension, Guardian’s Payment (Contributory), Bereavement Grant, Carer’s Benefit & Occupational Injuries Benefits.All benefits except Jobseeker’s Benefit, Bereavement Grant & Occupational Injuries Benefits.34,85544,35779,212EAll benefits except Jobseeker’s Benefit, Bereavement Grant & Occupational Injuries Benefits.13531166HAll benefits on discharge.

There is no upper income ceiling in relation to self-employed PRSI.Within the time available, the following table sets out the estimated yields in relation to some potential changes in PRSI rates:ChangeEstimated Full Year Yield€m1% increase in both lower and higher employers rate4801% increase in self-employed rate110PRSI is paid at various rates by different groups of workers, and their employers, across the economy. The only specific exemptions from PRSI relate to an employer's PRSI exemption scheme which has now closed to new entrants and the current employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme.Up to May 1st 2009, an Employer's PRSI exemption scheme was aligned directly with the back to work allowance (employee) scheme.  The scheme exempted employers from their share of the PRSI contribution in respect of recipients of the back to work allowance for the first two years of their employment.   A total of 777 cases were approved in 2008 and 213 cases approved in 2009. Given that this scheme was closed to new applications from May 1st, 2009 and that the duration of the exemption is two years, there will be no cases under this scheme from May 1st, 2011. PRSI income forgone in relation to these residual cases is not available.  The new employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme was launched on 20 June 2010.  Under the scheme, if an employer takes on an additional member of staff in 2010 that has been unemployed for 6 months or more, they will be exempted from paying employers' PRSI for 12 months.  The job must be new and additional, be for at least 30 hours a week, and last for at least six months.   To date exemptions have been awarded in respect of 791 employees. It is estimated that the full year income forgone as a result of these exemptions will be €1.8m.

The retirees were one at Principal Officer, two at Assistant Principal Officer and one at Higher Executive Officer level.It should be noted that, as per the terms of the Incentivised Early Retirement Scheme, none of the staff who availed of the scheme were replaced.  Over the past number of years, a significant number of staff left the Department, many as a result of the Decentralisation programme as staff not interested in transferring to Killarney moved to other Departments and offices in Dublin. Other staff also left the Department, many to transfer to the then Department of Social and Family Affairs.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The Government in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  Income from the charge is used to support the provision of local services.The charge is levied on a liability date in each year, and there is subsequently a three-month window in which to pay.  Section 6 of the Act provides for a late payment fee of €20 to apply in respect of each month or part of a month for which the charge remains unpaid after that period.  The Act places the onus on the owner to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance and there is no obligation on local authorities to issue demands or invoices.On the charge's introduction in 2009, radio and newspaper campaigns were run by my Department in order to ensure public awareness of the charge.  Local authorities have also undertaken advertising campaigns this year, both locally and nationally.  In addition, a number of local authorities have separately sent reminders to property owners registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  In this regard, every effort has been made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and any potential liability arising therefrom.

In its consultation paper issued in late 2006 the Law Reform Commission made a number of recommendations relating to areas within the remit of my Department. Those recommendations relating to planning and to physical aspects of multi-unit developments were addressed through the Planning Guidelines issued by my Department in 2007 and 2008.  These guidelines addressed design standards, sustainable residential development and the taking in charge of residential developments/ management arrangements.The Law Reform Commission's Report also recommended that legislation be introduced to address a range of other key issues, relating to management companies, common areas, service charges, sinking funds and dispute resolution. These recommendations were then considered by an interdepartmental group which included representatives from my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach and the National Consumer Agency. The deliberations of this group led to the preparation of the Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009 by the Department of Justice and Law Reform. Matters relating to progress on this Bill, are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.

In cases where an RF111A Goods Only Declaration is required, an income tax registration number is now routinely sought. A PPS number may be acceptable in certain circumstances.Under Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992, a licensing authority must be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed, and it is thus open to a motor tax office to seek additional documentation supporting a claim for the goods rate of motor tax.  Such documentation may include a certificate of commercial insurance or evidence of registration for VAT purposes, or, at the discretion of the licensing authority concerned, any other appropriate document.  Evidence of registration for VAT is not an obligatory requirement.

The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  The Act places the onus on the owner to assess his or her liability in the first instance and there is no obligation on local authorities to issue invoices or demands.  Any such obligation would increase the administrative and resource requirements of implementing the charge and would make its collection less cost-effective.  As the charge is set at an essentially modest rate of €200 per annum, it is essential that administrative costs be kept to a minimum.However, I understand that anybody who paid the charge last year and provided an e-mail address has been sent an e-mail reminder in respect of possible liability in 2010.  In addition, a number of local authorities have separately sent reminders to property owners registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).

The measures selected for inclusion in the scheme are considered to be the most optimum to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners at least cost and represent best use of budgetary resources.While replacement windows are not currently eligible for grant assistance under the scheme, my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland keep all approved measures under the scheme under constant review and will continue to give consideration to the scope for adding other measures to the scheme, subject to budgetary and technical considerations.I am advised that grants for window replacement are available to those over 60 under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, operated by local authorities on behalf of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This means tested scheme provides grants of up to €10,500 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out to their homes.

These tariffs include support for electricity generated from biomass co-fired with peat in the three peat-fired power stations.REFIT tariffs relate to the price to be paid for the electricity exported to the grid, rather than the price for inputs into that process.  This is the way in which existing REFIT tariffs have operated since 2006, and schemes across the EU also operate similarly.State Aid Clearance from the European Commission is required before the new feed in tariffs can be implemented.  My Department is currently finalising the State Aid submission with Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and this will be forwarded to the Commission this week.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	564	A number of initiatives have been taken over the last two years to improve participation by SMEs in tendering for public contracts. In 2008, the Tánaiste established the Procurement Innovation Group which was charged with identifying ways through which public procurement could be used to stimulate demand for innovative goods and services, while opening opportunities for all innovative companies, including SMEs, who wish to participate in public tendering.  The Group's report,"Using Public Procurement to Stimulate Innovation and SME Access to Public Contracts”, set out a series of recommendations aimed at improving the procurement function in public contracting bodies and increasing opportunities for SMEs to tender for contracts.In parallel with the Procurement Innovation Group's report, my Department published a 10-Step Guide to Smart Procurement and SME Access to Public Contracts   in July 2009, which provided practical guidance to public bodies on measures which could boost the involvement of SMEs in public procurement.In August this year, the Minister for Finance issued guidelines to public contracting authorities aimed at operating their tendering processes in a manner that facilitates increased participation by SMEs, while ensuring that all purchasing is carried out in a manner that is legal, transparent, and secures optimal value for money for the taxpayer.  The guidelines also highlight practices that are to be avoided where they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.In July this year, I wrote to over 50 contracting authorities inviting them to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with Enterprise Ireland, aimed at facilitating SME participation in public sector opportunities.  The Memorandum of Understanding will help to ensure that the Government's objective of driving innovation and supporting SMEs has the required commitment from public funded organisations and semi state bodies.  Included in the initial target listing of contracting authorities were organisations which have a large budget spend, those that had a significant importance for an SME reference site, and all city and county councils.  I have requested to be kept apprised on progress and of any other action which might be required.

In 2009, the expenditure in this regard was €58,599,000.The increase in expenditure in 2009 was largely due to the full year cost of the T16 pay increase awarded with effect from 1 September 2008.  Recruitment undertaken in 2008 also impacted on the full year costs in 2009.As the majority of retirements under the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement were in the final quarter of 2009, the anticipated savings for the Department's pay expenditure will not be reflected until the end of 2010.Similarly, Departmental pay savings to be made from the retirements under the ISER in 2010 will not materialise until the end of 2011.The expenditure in respect of the payment of salaries for the Department and its Offices to the end of September 2010 is €38,142,000.Staffing matters within the agencies under the aegis of my Department are a day to day matter for the agencies concerned provided they operate within the parameters of the Employment Control Framework and the moratorium on recruitment.

The Report provides a road map for positioning Ireland as an international innovation development hub and I am very pleased with the progress we are making in realising this objective.Our inaugural meeting on 1 June enabled the Committee to ascertain those issues where it could move immediately to implementation, where it needed, in the first instance, to constitute and deploy expert working groups as specified by the ITF and where close engagement with agencies and other Government Departments to progress implementation was necessary. An immediate development following from this meeting was my appointment of an Intellectual Property Implementation Group charged with developing and realising the intellectual property — (IP) related recommendations of the ITF Report together with a detailed IP review conducted by Forfás for my Department.  The development of a clear IP Protocol will help Ireland maximise the return on public investment and support the commercialisation of Irish research and development.At our second meeting on 20 July, I briefed Committee members on the significant progress that had been made in implementing key recommendations in the ITF report, namely:  The €500 million Innovation Fund-Ireland, which had been announced by the Taoiseach on 12 July, will target the development of a vibrant venture capital community in Ireland through attracting top international venture capitalists.Together with the Taoiseach, I had launched Cycle 5 of PRTLI on 16 July, a €296m investment supporting third level research and leveraging €63m private investment.The very positive outcome of my discussions with the Minister for Finance with regard to identifying and securing provision for a number of ITF recommendations in the Capital Envelopes to 2016.  These provisions, which were subsequently published, will enable my Department and its agencies to support innovative companies, grow high performance start up companies, provide more venture capital and develop a portfolio of sector specific Angel Funds and increase Enterprise Ireland supports for commercialisation. They will also enable the retention of a strategic mass of world class researchers who act as a pull factor for foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland.Secretaries General of Government Departments and Chief Executives of agencies provided detailed updates on the implementation of recommendations for which their organisations has lead responsibility. In the light of these detailed reports and ensuing discussion, the Committee agreed in the first instance to focus on priority recommendations for implementation.For its third meeting on 19 October, the Committee agreed that it would focus in depth on a small number of the priority recommendations in the venture funds and venture capital areas and on our start up and seed funding strategy.Members of the Committee also had an exchange of views on the tax recommendations from among those in the ITF Report which they regard as priorities for Budget 2011. The Committee also welcomed the recent decision by the Council of the Irish Universities Association to endorse a scheme of bonus points for leaving certificate higher level maths students and noted the progress that was being made in implementing other initiatives, such as Project Maths, to promote the take up of higher level maths.This meeting afforded me an opportunity to brief members on significant developments in other fora that had taken place since 20 July and which support the implementation of the recommendations in the ITF Report.The Committee's next meeting is scheduled for 15 December.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	570	The role of the 14 Local and 10 Regional Drugs Task Forces is to assess the nature and extent of the illicit drug problems in their areas of operation, to make proposals to deal with these problems, to facilitate greater local/regional focus on drugs issues and a more co-ordinated response to them and to oversee and monitor drug-related projects approved on foot of their action plans and proposals.In 2010 the Drugs Task Forces were asked to assess all projects currently being funded to ensure that they:are drugs targeted and evidence based;can show tangible outputs and outcomes;address current gaps and local needs in their areas; anddemonstrate clear links with the priorities as set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.I understand that, when allocating funding to addiction service providers, the North Eastern Regional Drugs Task Force ascertains if the project aims are in line with national strategic objectives and if it reflects the agreed regional priorities.  The Task Force also considers it prudent to ensure that the project promoter has a proven track record in delivering similar services and that it has the capacity to carry out the aims of the project.In relation to projects with an addiction counselling element, service providers are required to provide evidence that all counsellors are professionally qualified and that they are members of relevant accredited bodies.The North Eastern Regional Drugs Task Force works with all service providers to ensure that they have in place policies and procedures, including those relating to recruitment, that are open and transparent.  With regard to the employment of sessional workers on a contract for services basis, provision is made to procure these from a pool of suitably qualified applicants.Furthermore, I would like to assure the Deputy that all those working with vulnerable adults on a one-to-one basis are required to be Garda vetted.  The contract for services for sessional workers also includes provision for this.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	571	The primary function of the Drugs Advisory Group is to advise the Minister on operational and policy matters relating to the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  The Group also, inter alia,   oversees and supports the work of the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces, ensures that policy is informed by their work and provides a liaison, reporting and representational role between the Task Forces and the Office of the Minister for Drugs.  The Departmental Liaison person to the North East Region from my Department's Drugs Advisory Group was contacted in May of this year following receipt by me of a letter from the person concerned.  The Liaison person met with the Coordinator for the North East Regional Drugs Task Force and with two members of the service in question and the Treasurer of the Board of Management of the service on 3 June 2010.  They discussed each of the concerns raised about the services.  A report was received by my office, dated 4 June, and provided details in relation to:the recruitment process,the clinical services,the leadership and management of the service andthe employee services.The Departmental Liaison person confirmed that they had no concerns in relation to any of the areas listed and that it was evident that quality services are provided to the target group and that it is managed competently and professionally.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	574	Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. Responsibility for the prevention of crime, including people trafficking, rests primarily with An Garda Síochána.However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.  All eight Naval Service patrol vessels are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.  The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time, and all vessels are multi-tasked in that they undertake general surveillance security and other duties while conducting their primary day-to-day tasking of providing a fishery protection service.  Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of our Exclusive Economic Zone using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.I am advised by the Military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 September 2010, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 9,625 comprising 7,845 Army, 776 Air Corps and 1,004 Naval Service personnel.  Targeted recruitment is being carried out in 2010 in order to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces, and while it is not possible to anticipate strength figures for 2011, I can confirm that with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all its roles, including in relation to the support provided by the Naval Service and Air Corps in the prevention of drug and people trafficking through coastal surveillance.

On foot of the Government Decision on Public Service numbers, which took effect from 27 March 2009, no post in the Defence Forces, however arising, could be filled by recruitment, promotion or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties of a higher grade.The present position is that within the context of consolidating the public finances, the Government is focused firmly on maintaining the operational efficiency of the Permanent Defence Force. Government approval was secured in the context of Budget 2010 for a level of 10,000 all ranks. This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.Targeted recruitment is being carried out in 2010 in order to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces. To this end I approved the recruitment of 40 Recruits to the Naval Service, limited recruitment to the Army and the intake of 30 Cadets from the Cadetship Competition 2010 which closed on the 28th July 2010.The number of general service enlisted personnel who left the Permanent Defence Force from 2007 to the end of September 2010 are as follows:YearArmyNaval ServiceAir CorpsTotal2007497774762120084475328528200936336314301 January to 30 September  20102142833275I intend, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.

A number of options are being developed by Civilian and Military management and subject, to their advice, I would expect to be in a position to consider the proposals and bring forward recommendations to Government as appropriate towards the end of the year.With regard to Ireland's participation in future Battlegroups, we are committed to participation in the Nordic Battlegroup (NBG), which will be on stand-by for the first six (6) months of 2011.  Other contributors to the Nordic Battlegroup are Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia.  Our contribution in 2011 will be a Recce/ISTAR. Recce is an abbreviation of Reconnaissance.  ISTAR is an acronym for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target, Acquisition and Reconnaissance.  Recce/ISTAR Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force headquarters amounting to approximately 150 personnel.Ireland is also committed to participation in the Austro-German led Battlegroup, which will be on stand-by for the second six (6) months of 2012.  Other contributors to the Austro-German Battlegroup are Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).  Ireland's contribution to this Battlegroup will again be a Recce/ISTAR Company of approximately 130 personnel.The Government has approved participation in both Battlegroups.

I refer the Deputy to Question No. 150 of the 2nd June 2010 (Reference No. 23757/10) which stated: "The Department has had three meetings with Kildare County Council over the past two years to discuss, amongst other things, the issue of the continued occupation of married quarters by former members of the Defence Forces.  Discussions have not taken place with any other local authority, as this is predominantly an issue arising in relation to the Curragh Camp.  Kildare County Council has informed the Department that the overholders must be registered on their housing list before any consideration can be given to providing accommodation for them."The position remains unchanged.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 224 together.There has been very significant investment in equipment for the Defence Forces in recent years covering the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  The level of investment has ensured that Defence Forces personnel have the most modern and effective range of equipment and technology available, on a par with the best international practice and requirements, to carry out their day-to-day roles.  A particular focus of the investment programme has been on upgrading equipment for overseas peace support operations. In this regard, it is a matter of fact that the Defence Forces contingents, which served in major overseas missions in recent years in Liberia, Kosovo and Chad were the best equipped and best prepared contingents ever sent overseas.The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces will remain a key focus for me as Minister for Defence. It is, however, imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces look to whatever efficiencies we can make taking into account the current difficult economic environment and the overall financial envelope available for the Department for the acquisition of new military equipment and for upgrading and refurbishment programmes over the coming years.  The budgetary situation will dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades in that period and decisions will be made accordingly.Several important equipment purchases will be advanced this year including the acquisition of twenty-seven Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles, ¾ Ton 4 x 4 vehicles and Heavy Recovery Vehicles for the Defence Forces. In addition, a contract has now been placed with Babcock Marine in the United Kingdom for the provision of two new ships for the Naval Service.  The first new ship is scheduled for delivery in early 2014 and the second ship will follow one year later. The contract value is of the order of €100m.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	579	Members of the Permanent Defence Force receive ongoing training to enable them to meet the challenges arising from the changing defence and security environment, and to participate fully in UN, EU and other UN mandated missions.  Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training, designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection. Pre-deployment training is updated on an ongoing basis in the light of any changes in the threat assessment or mission requirements.The Defence Forces are also involved in interoperability training and technical developments in co-ordination with UN and EU partners  For example, the Defence Forces are currently engaged in the Live Exercise (LIVEX) Joint Action, part of the main interoperability exercise during Ireland’s membership of the Nordic Battlegroup 2011.  The Defence Forces have also participated in a range of desktop and command post exercises based on realistic peacekeeping scenarios.  Defence Forces training is based on and updated in accordance with best practice international training standards.Ireland, in common with other neutral EU Member States who are members of Partnership for Peace (PfP), participates in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP) mechanism for planning in relation to peace support operations.  The scope of Ireland's involvement in PARP is focused on enhancing interoperability so that Defence Forces personnel can operate efficiently and effectively in a multi-national environment.I am satisfied that Defence Forces personnel will continue to receive the necessary training to enable them to carry out their duties in a professional manner.
