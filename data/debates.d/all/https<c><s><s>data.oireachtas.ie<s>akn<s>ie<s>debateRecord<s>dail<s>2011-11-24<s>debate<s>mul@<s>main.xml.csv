What we have seen is a fiasco of a jobs initiative and the unemployment figures as bad as ever.  On mortgage debt, nothing is happening.  We left behind us——

I ask the Government today to spell out the exact actions it will implement to help people with distressed mortgages to pay those mortgages.  I ask the Tánaiste to explain how, in all the leaks we are getting, there has been no mention of dealing with this issue, which is paramount for ordinary people who are trying to struggle from day to day.

That report, as the Deputy knows and as we discovered, was not sufficient to deal with the mortgage difficulties people are facing.  That is why the new Government asked the Keane group to bring forward a new set of recommendations as to what needed to be done to address the mortgage difficulties facing people.  We brought the Keane report into this House to hear the words of wisdom from Deputy Ó Cuív and other Deputies who wanted to contribute on the issue and to offer either added solutions or alternative solutions.  All of that is now being considered by the Government and we are bringing forward proposals that will be considered by Government within the next couple of weeks.  They will include measures such as mortgage-to-rent schemes and work being done by the Minister for Justice and Equality in introducing a personal insolvency Bill, and they will bring forward a range of measures that will provide practical solutions to people who are in mortgage difficulty, all things the Fianna Fáil-Green Government failed to do over the period it was in office.

One simple change would have helped a lot of people, namely, to have abolished the 30 hour rule where if a two income family becomes a one income family and that person works more than 30 hours a week, they cannot get mortgage interest supplement.  We made other constructive changes to mortgage interest supplement which could have been done and more could have been done to build on that.  The Government did N-O-T-H-I-N-G — nothing — in the meantime.

What is the Government going to do about that to ensure that people who are temporarily unemployed are able to resolve the issue so that they will not have to give up their house and will not have to go into bankruptcy?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	45	There were some good recommendations in the Cooney report.  I said the Cooney report was not sufficient to deal with the range of difficulties that people in mortgage distress have had.  Let us not forget they are in mortgage distress because of the difficulties Deputy Ó Cuív and his colleagues put them in.  This Government is dealing with that issue.  We had the Keane group look at the issue and following publication of the group's report, we have had a round of consultation with people who are interested and active in the area of providing support to people in mortgage distress.  We have heard what Members of this House had to say about additional or further measures that could be taken.  Those are being worked on.  The issue is before the Government and this Government is clear in its approach to the mortgage issue.  We want to ensure people will not lose their homes in this crisis.  We are determined to take the steps necessary to ensure that happens.  There are numerous recommendations, both in the Keane report and additional matters, that have been discussed here and elsewhere that we are going to progress.  The objective is that people will be able to remain living in their own homes.

This recession will not last forever, because of the way in which the Government is dealing with it and getting the country out of the hole Deputy Ó Cuív's party put it in.  While we are doing that, many families will have difficulty paying their mortgages.  They are in mortgage distress and we will ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they will not be put out of their homes and will receive the kind of support necessary to ensure their mortgage distress is dealt with.  The Government is considering what has been said here and the advice it received from the various groups and organisations it met since the publication of the Keane report.  It will announce its measures when it has made final decisions.

Before the election, the party was crystal clear.  It promised not to cut child benefit, introduce student fees or increase the registration charge.  It even attacked its buddies in Fine Gael for proposing a 2% increase in VAT, a tax which, as we all know, will hit the poorest hardest.  In spite of adopting these positions, the Labour Party has U-turned.

It is in this critical test that the Government had its greatest failure.  We saw yesterday that its proposed nominee to the European Court of Auditors has been rejected by a European Parliament committee.

He should realise that the days in which a Government can remove or reward officials by automatically promoting them to top jobs in Europe need to be left behind.

Her accusation today that we have not delivered on political reform is also wrong.  We cut the pay of Ministers, made cuts regarding the transport arrangements of Ministers and capped the salaries of public servants.  We have changed the pension arrangements for top-level public servants and the arrangements for the appointment of top-level civil servants through changes in the TLAC system.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced last week the most comprehensive set of public service reforms we have seen in this country.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald was wrong about that too.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Tánaiste's Government is the one that broke its own guidelines on capping pay for its special advisers.  That is on the record.  His Government still allows senior civil servants to walk away with bonanza pension pots.  His Government, and he in particular, gets very rattled at the very prospect that a senior civil servant might be called to account in this Dáil.  He claims his nominee remains the Government's nominee.  That is not a credible position given the view taken by the budgetary committee in the European Parliament.  More important, it is not a credible position on the part of a Government that proposes to introduce, in the short term, swingeing cuts affecting people on low and middle incomes.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Could we have the Deputy's question now, please?
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I ask the Tánaiste again whether he will pull the plug on the nomination.  Will he live up to his promise of accountability within the public service?  Will he allow the public to be confident that, at last, the political system will have one rule and one standard for all the people and not cosset those at the very top?

That is why, from the very beginning of this Administration, we took unprecedented steps to cap the salaries of senior public servants and staff in the semi-State sector and to change the inherited arrangements pertaining to pensions and severance deals.  From the very beginning of the life of the Government we took steps which had not been taken previously to cap the pay of senior public servants and others in the semi-State sector and change the arrangements we had inherited in regard to pensions and severance deals.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Seven out of eight nominees got through yesterday; only one was rejected.  Whatever way one looks at it, this result is a humiliation not only for the candidate but also for the Government and the country.  My question will give the Tánaiste an opportunity to respond to the comments made by the Taoiseach in the House yesterday.  In the Tánaiste's absence, the Taoiseach commented on what had happened on the night of the bank guarantee, as he is wont to do when engaged in parliamentary battle with Fianna Fáil Members.  It was a fair point and the Tánaiste himself took an honourable position of opposition to the guarantee.  How could the Government nominate the sole survivor of the events of that shameful night?  The bankers, the politicians and the other advisers involved have gone.  The one person who survived and was part of the cabal in Merrion Street was nominated for promotion.  I do not understand why this happened.I can only suggest what has happened is a humiliation for the Taoiseach, although not as much for the Tánaiste.  The Taoiseach is reported to have contacted his colleagues in the European People's Party to ask them to vote for the candidate in question.  In response they were unanimous in giving two fingers to the Taoiseach.  It is a humiliation for Ireland and begs the question of whether the genuflection in which the Taoiseach has been indulging has been wasted on the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French President, Nicholas Sarkozy.  Mrs. Merkel is allied to the EPP.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Deputy Ross's description of what happened on the night of the bank guarantee is very colourful and it may have been a cabal.  However, we have an independent Civil Service, an independence I respect.  It is not right to come into the House and accuse an independent civil servant of being part of a cabal.  The Government in office at the time took a political decision for which it was politically responsible.  Certain Members voted in favour of that decision in the House — others voted against it — for which they will have to take political responsibility.  Until such time as we change our system we will have an independent Civil Service which has been a cornerstone of the way we do business in this country and we will abandon it at our peril.  However unpopular it may be today or any other day for me to defend the independence of the Civil Service, I will continue to do so.  The Government nominated a senior civil servant for appointment to the European Court of Auditors and he presented to the budgetary committee yesterday.  I did not follow the exchanges, but I understand that, by and large, the reaction was positive.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	119	In many cases, votes taken at committees of the European Parliament are overturned in plenary session.  We will have to await the formal report from the committee to the European Parliament, but in the meantime I ask Deputy Ross to respect the fact that our civil servants operate independently of the Government.  Under our system, civil servants are not permitted to speak publicly in their own defence or about matters on which they give advice to the Government.  This is an important point to make.  If Deputies want to change this to a system under which Secretaries General would be allowed to make public statements on the advice they give to the Government or become part of the political process, let us have that debate.  It is a matter for the House to decide and if the Deputy wants to introduce a Private Members' Bill to change the current system, he should do so and we will debate it.  Until we introduce such a change, however, I ask him to have some respect for the people we appoint to independently advise whatever Government happens to be in office.

Was the individual in question nominated by the Government because it wished to create a vacancy in the Department of Finance and it had a difficulty, or was he nominated because he had great talents which we wanted to export to the European Union?

It was certainly commented on in the European institutions.  The Government decided that, instead of appointing a former politician, somebody associated with politics or one of the political parties in government or another alternative that naturally would have brought criticism on us, it would appoint a senior civil servant who fitted the requirements of the post.We decided to nominate the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, a senior civil servant who would serve as the Irish representative on the European Court of Auditors.  That is why we made the decision.

There are three Bills under the Department of Finance for which agreement has been made with the troika that their publication will be at a later date.  They are the Central Bank (regulation of credit unions) Bill; the fiscal responsibility Bill; and the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism Bill.  However, it is intended to publish those Bills early next year.  It is intended to publish the remainder of the Bills as indicated on the A list this session.  In addition to the Bills that were on the A list, three other Bills have also been published.

In addition to the Bills on the A list which have been published, three other Bills that were not on the original A list have been published.  The intention still is to publish these Bills.  As I indicated, the requirement to publish some of the Bills comes from the memorandum of understanding, a document with which the Deputy should be familiar as the Government of which he was a member negotiated and agreed it.  There were commitments in respect of some Bills which were required to be published by the end of this year.  As part of the renegotiation the Government has done with the troika, the time limit for publication of these Bills has been moved forward.  The Government is continuing to prepare those Bills and will publish them as quickly as possible.  I am simply saying they may not be published before the end of this session.  The intention with regard to the rest of the legislative programme on the A list is to progress that by the end of this session.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	155	That is not a matter for the Order of Business.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	156	——in violent situations is ring-fenced.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	157	That is a matter for a parliamentary question.  I call the Tánaiste on promised legislation.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I share the Deputy's concern on the issue of domestic violence.  This is an issue about which the Government is seriously concerned and that is why the programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to address all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation.  While that legislation is being prepared, as the Deputy has already been informed, the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 has been widened to include protections provided in the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  A minimum period of cohabitation is no longer required before one of a cohabiting couple may apply for a safety order.  Previously the applicant was required to have resided with the respondent for at least six of the previous 12 months.  Same-sex couples now have the same access to the protection of the Domestic Violence Act as opposite-sex couples.  The scope of section 2 of that Act, which specified who may apply for a safety order, has been broadened to enable a person to obtain a safety order against a person with whom he or she has a child in common.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I call Deputy Higgins.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I am aware of all that but can the Tánaiste indicate when the full package will come before the House?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	161	No.  I have called Deputy Higgins.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Next Thursday the local government household charges Bill is scheduled.  However, the draft schedule indicates that only five hours is allocated for not just the Second Stage, but all Stages of that Bill.  Given that this has profound implications and represents the thin end of the wedge providing for two new taxes on property and water, which could amount to €1,300 for each household eventually, far more time than that is needed.  A guillotine on that Bill will not be acceptable.  I ask the Government to allow sufficient time for every Deputy who wants to contribute on all Stages.  Despite the seriousness of the Bill, it has not yet been published.  I cannot get a time for when it will be in the hands of Deputies.  When will the household charges Bill be published and made available to Members?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I expect that it will be published by the weekend.  The time arrangements for its discussion may be discussed with the Whips.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	164	In line with the commitment contained in the programme for Government, I ask the Tánaiste to give a commitment that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will introduce a climate change Bill.  The Minister will travel to Durban on 29 November to participate in critical climate change discussions.  It is unacceptable for him to do so without the Government, at least, having in place a firm commitment to introducing that legislation.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Has such legislation been promised?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	166	There is no ambiguity about the matter.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government that a climate change Bill will be produced and that commitment will be honoured.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	167	When?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I call Deputy Tom Fleming.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I have not received an answer.  When will the commitment be honoured?
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	170	When will legislation be introduced in the House regarding the single tier health system proposed in the programme for Government?  I note it is also proposed to establish a hospital fund within that system.  Both yesterday evening and this morning there has been devastating breaking news about hospitals and one major nursing home, St. Columbanus Home in Killarney.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I am sorry, Deputy, but we cannot have a debate on the matter.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Moreover, three district hospitals——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	173	Is this a matter for a parliamentary question?
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	174	——in Dingle, Caherciveen and Listowel are being hit, with 50 beds being lost.  This is drastic action.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	175	If the Deputy were to table a parliamentary question——
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I ask the Tánaiste to request the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	177	——or seek to raise the issue in a topical issue debate, I would consider it.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	178	——and his two Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Shortall——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I must ask the Deputy to resume his seat.  However, if he would care to table——
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I ask that this matter be looked at seriously.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	181	No, we are only dealing with promised legislation.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	182	There is huge panic among senior citizens in County Kerry, as well the staff of these hospitals and nursing homes.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	183	No legislation has been promised.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The Tánaiste should respond positively because this matter is a source of great concern.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Is legislation required?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	186	The Deputy is correct that the Government is undertaking major reforms of the health service and the HSE, some of which will require legislation.  When that legislation has been prepared, it will be introduced.  I also agree with the Deputy that some of the exceptionally apocalyptic stories appearing in some sections of the newspapers on hospital closures are way off the mark.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Deputy Griffin will look after the Deputy.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	188	We are running short of time and I want to facilitate as many Deputies as I can.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	189	On legislation the Government intends to introduce next week, it is bad enough that it intends to impose a regressive stealth tax on the most basic items human beings need to survive, namely, housing and water——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	190	Would the Deputy mind dispensing with the preliminaries, as other Deputies are queueing up?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	191	This matter relates to the schedule of business for next week.  It is bad enough——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The Deputy should just ask about that business.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	193	As I stated, I am specifically asking about legislation to be introduced next week.  It is bad enough that the Government is proposing to impose taxes on housing and water services——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Would the Deputy, please, cut out the preliminaries?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	195	At the very least, will the Government do the House and the public the courtesy of not using the guillotine?  I ask the Tánaiste to give that commitment now, rather than batting the issue off to the Whips.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	196	To which legislation is the Deputy referring?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I am referring to legislation included in next week's schedule.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	198	What is it?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The legislation on household charges.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The Deputy did not say that.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Will the Tánaiste give a commitment——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	202	There are other Deputies offering, for whom six minutes remain.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	203	——that Members will have a proper amount of time to debate that legislation?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	204	Will the Deputy please show respect for his colleagues?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	205	As I stated, the time arrangements for the debate can be discussed by the Whips.  The House will obviously make whatever arrangements it wishes.  Moreover, in my experience, during the lifetime of the Government, there has been no great difficulty in the amount of time made available to the Opposition to make its case on legislation.  The only difficulty I can see is that the Opposition often does not use up the time made available to it.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	206	That is not true——
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The Government gives it time, but it is unable to keep the debate going.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	208	That is not true of the Technical Group.

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Is the Deputy also deaf?
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	213	All Departments are trying to make savings and one area in which savings could potentially be made is the use of generic drugs.  Some 90% of the drugs used are branded, although in other countries a lot more generic drugs are used.  One way to fix the problem is through the health (pricing and supply of medicines) Bill.  When will that legislation be brought before the House because it has the potential to save the Exchequer several hundred million euro?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	214	The heads of the Bill have been approved.  The Bill is being drafted and I expect it to be published early next year.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I wish to refer to two important items of promised legislation, the first of which is the national vetting bureau Bill which I acknowledge is in hand.  I wish to ascertain its progress and when it is likely to become law.  The second which is of equal importance is the companies (consolildation) Bill.  While I acknowledge it is a highly complicated consolidation Bill that will take a long time to draft, it is of fundamental importance to the country and the economy.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	216	The national vetting bureau Bill is being worked on as a matter of priority, although there are complex legal issues involved.  As I have stated previously, the companies (consolidation) Bill is major legislation, comprising approximately 1,200 heads.  Its publication is expected in the middle of next year.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I refer to the betting Bill and note that huge amounts of revenue are leaving Ireland by way of online betting and gambling.  When will the Bill be introduced and will it capture that revenue to redress the imbalance, particularly given the current economic crisis?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	218	While I do not have a date for publication of the Bill on online betting, I will ask the Minister to communicate directly with the Deputy.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I wish to inform the Chief Whip that, thank God, I am not deaf or blind.  I would like him to withdraw that comment.In line with the questions asked by Deputies Higgins and Boyd Barrett, I refer to the Water Services (Amendment) Bill which is due to be taken next week but which has not yet been published.  This is shameful.  While the aforementioned Deputies referred to the household and water charges, I refer in the main to the proposed septic tank charge which could be as high as €15,000 for some householders.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	220	We cannot debate the legislation now.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I am not debating it, but I want to know when it will be published.  Moreover, will there be adequate time for debate without use of the guillotine?  It would be completely wrong to impose such a measure, as the matter is too serious for that, as Deputies opposite will find out when they return to their constituencies.  The debate should not be guillotined.  While it is a murky matter, one should not muddy the waters too much.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I think this question has been answered, but perhaps the Tánaiste might repeat the answer.

In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:"(h) an offence under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008,”.The offence proposed to be added here is on the advice of the Attorney General's office.  It is an additional one in the category of serious offences and relates to trafficking for the purposes of sexual or other exploitation.  Offences relating to trafficking of illegal immigrants are already included in subsection (e) but this includes human trafficking for sexual exploitation.  Where any person has been convicted of this offence, this amendment will allow me to make a decision on such a person’s good repute and decide whether they should be involved in a road haulage or passenger transport business.As with the other serious offences listed in the section, this is an important measure for public safety.  Essentially, it takes account of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 and allows it to be taken into account if somebody applying for a haulage licence has been involved in human trafficking in addition to the existing provision for involvement in illegal immigration.

In page 6, subsection (1), line 30, before "the operator" to insert the following:"excluding politically motivated offences covered by the Good Friday Agreement and which predate the enactment of the agreement,".This is an amendment in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  It has been tabled because there are people who over several decades were convicted in this and other jurisdictions, and there is recognition through the Good Friday Agreement and through the release of prisoners that there is a peace process in place and that restrictions should not be made against them.  In the current form, the Bill would impose a restriction which would prevent some of those who were convicted during that period from taking up positions that are covered by the legislation.I have discussed this type of proposal with various Ministers when they have sought to put restrictions on membership of other bodies or holding directorships at different levels.  For example, in one case a person who had been convicted more than 30 years ago of an offence in the Six Counties and who was working as a community worker in the Dundalk area for nearly 15 years was being prevented from adopting a child because of the restrictions.  There was no leeway or dispensation to take account of the changed circumstances on the island.  If the Bill is allowed to pass in this way, it will be seen as a bit of vindictiveness against those who were convicted of political offences in that period.  That is the spirt in which the amendment is put and I ask the Minister to take it on board.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I support the amendment as put by Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  I outlined the reasoning behind it on the floor of the House yesterday.  We are in a new situation and there are huge opportunities for those who were involved, not through any fault of their own, in the conflict we are now coming out of, or, thank God, are out of.  It is a step backwards that people who worked so hard to bring about a peaceful situation could find themselves being discriminated against because of their involvement in the struggle in the Six Counties.  If that same legislation was enacted 70 or 80 years ago, I doubt there would have been anybody sitting in here — let us be honest about it.  In the peace process and the political process that emanated from it, including the negotiations where the British Government was prepared to accept that people involved in the conflict, even prisoners, were of a special category, the prisoners were effectively released having served two years.  In the Six Counties, there is no way they are discriminated against in that way.I ask the Minister to take the amendment on board.  It would be a very positive step and positive for all of us who have worked through the years since 1998 in trying to implement the workings of the Good Friday Agreement and the Hillsborough Agreement.  All of that is coming into train and we are in a totally different dispensation now.  Through this amendment, the Bill should effectively protect the rights of people who found themselves in that situation.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I support the general thrust of the amendment put forward by Sinn Féin.  I say that in the context of recognising that many people have committed offences in the past regardless of their motivation, whether political or otherwise, at a certain time in their lives.  Everybody has to be given an opportunity to have a second chance.  There have been discussions in this House about legislation in regard to the spent convictions principle.  While it may not be possible to do it in this instance, the Government in general needs to look at some way of recognising that every citizen is entitled to a second chance, regardless of the nature of their criminal activity at some point in their past.Our whole criminal justice system is about ensuring that people pay a penalty in the first instance for the crime they have committed, but very much part of imprisonment or other sanctions associated with a conviction is ensuring that people get an opportunity to change their ways, if one likes.  Therefore, it is necessary for the Government to look in general terms at the way in which individuals who have been convicted in the past of some heinous crime, regardless of the motivation, are given an opportunity to change.  Many do, some do not.  Some clearly do not learn their lesson from the activities they have been involved in or any sanction that has been imposed on them, but some do.It perhaps needs to be expressed to some extent in some legislative form that at least provides the Minister with the opportunity or capacity, in this case because he will sanction the licence, to take into account the fact such individuals have made good on their desire to be model citizens of the State.  We must find a way to allow them to participate in a wholesome and full way by being able to provide meaningful employment for themselves, if that is the course they seek to take.  In general terms, we support the amendment so that this broad principle of giving people a second chance is somehow encompassed in legislation generally.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I once again ask the Minister to consider our amendment.  I know he referred to this some days ago and stated that while he was opposed to the amendment, he might talk to his Cabinet colleagues to find whether there was another way to deal with this in terms of making exceptions for people who come under the St. Andrews Agreement.This is very important.  There has been too much rowing back on issues concerning the St. Andrews Agreement, and the A5 is another example.  The Government made a commitment to be part of that process of building the road in the north west.  The wrong message is going out to people who have given an awful lot of commitment and had an awful lot of faith in the whole agreement.  The agreement is working.  People are doing their best but some are being penalised as a result of supporting this agreement.  I once again plead with the Minister not to penalise these people who have supported the St. Andrews Agreement.  It is important the message goes out that they will not be left aside and that there is a mechanism to look after them and not to discriminate against them in terms of jobs.  We have seen this happen with adoptions here where people who were former prisoners, and who have come under the St. Andrews Agreement, were discriminated against.  This would send out the wrong signal.  I once again plead with the Minister to support the amendment.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I also support the amendment.  Any healthy functioning society will always look for an opportunity to welcome people back into the fold.  All corrective action, all forms of discipline and punishment must be geared towards bringing people back in rather than excluding them forever.  On the basic principle involved, I definitely support the amendment.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The amendment applies to politically motivated offences which are covered by and occurred before the Good Friday Agreement.  I point out that in the context of this Road Transport Bill we are talking about very serious offences.  We are not talking about membership of the IRA.  Somebody convicted for membership of the IRA is not precluded from holding a haulage licence nor is somebody who threw stones or petrol bombs at the RUC or somebody who defended his or her community.  The kinds of offences we are talking about here are very serious ones.  They are offences like rape, money laundering, drug smuggling, murder and armed robbery.  I am not sure if one could ever describe those kinds of offences as being politically motivated ones.The principle that has been established to date is that people convicted of these offences who were members of paramilitary organisations whose campaign is at an end can be put on early release.  They are put on early release under licence, there is no amnesty, convictions are not expunged and they are still convicted criminals.  That is the current legal situation.  It is possible, under this legislation, for somebody to go to the District Court and make his or her case as to why he or she should still have a licence.I appreciate where Deputies are coming from.  There is a case for saying that what is in the past is in the past and the time has now come to draw a line under what occurred in the past.  If there is an appropriate way to do that, it should be done perhaps by a spent convictions Bill.  We have a Bill already enacted that states that convictions that were made a certain period ago, particularly minor convictions, are considered to be spent so that somebody's record is clear, or perhaps there could be an amnesty Bill.  If this issue is to be pursued, it should be pursued in that way perhaps in the form of a Private Members' Bill that would give an amnesty or consider these convictions to be spent.  This is a Road Transport Bill and I do not believe this is the place to address that issue.  If that issue was addressed, it would only be addressed in this Bill.  It would not apply, for example, to taxi licences or other areas the likes of which were raised yesterday.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	251	A Private Members' Bill on this area was produced by the former Deputy Barry Andrews while in government prior to he becoming a Minister of State and it only got as far as being taken in committee.  Another Bill has now been produced but it only deals with minor offences.  The Minister has turned the very argument he made on its head when he said IRA membership was not regarded as a serious offence and that this Bill only deals with convictions for serious offences.A look back on the history of this State and convictions in the Special Criminal Court in particular would show that most of the convictions were not just for IRA membership.  Quite a number of them were for what were regarded by the State as serious offences.  It was all part of the same process that happened in the Six Counties and in Britain where the struggle for Irish freedom was criminalised, specifically to try to label those who were challenging British occupation in Ireland as criminal.  The very same policy was implemented by the British in this State in the 1920s.  There are people who sat on the Government benches who were convicted of very serious offences and went on to become Ministers.  History shows us that those who were involved at various stages of Ireland's fight for freedom were awarded medals and pensions by the then Government.  There was positive discrimination by various Governments in the past, not only by Cumann na nGaedheal but also by Fianna Fáil which ensured that those who were active were given selective jobs or fast promotion in recognition of the sacrifice they had made, the fact that they had been criminalised and brutalised and that their families had been also.When the spent convictions Bill produced by the former Deputy Barry Andrews was introduced I spoke on it and I argued the case with that former Deputy, as I have argued in regard to the latest Bill that it does not go far enough because it does not address the legacy of the most recent conflict.  The only way to deal with it properly, and the Minister is right in what he said, is to introduce a proper Bill that would expunge those convictions, or something to that effect, which are related to political offences committed before the Good Friday Agreement.  It comes down to their being political will to do this.  I have raised this matter on numerous occasions in regard to taxis and other issues and have appealed to Ministers to examine it and on every occasion the Minister concerned has said that he or she understands the position but that it is a matter for another Bill and it is always the case that it is a matter for another Bill.We are considering producing legislation which will provide for what I have sought.  However, usually when legislation is produced on this side of the House, that is where it rests.  It might be passed but it tends not to be taken in committee.  The only true way to ensure that legislation is passed is for Deputies and the Government to take this matter on as a project.  Given the history of some of those in government, they might also be happy for some of their former comrades to be covered by such legislation.I appeal, through the Minister, to the Government and the Tánaiste in particular to examine producing legislation to cover this matter and not to discriminate, legislation that would protect those people and not allow them to be discriminated in the way that this legislation does.  For politics to work the message must go out that the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement are intact and are not being shredded piecemeal as seems to happen —  reference was made to the A5 and there are other matters in respect of which the full delivery of the Good Friday Agreement still has not happened in this State.  The Human Rights Commission is being amalgamated rather than promoted and properly resourced.  There is also a range of other issues that have not been addressed.Apart from those who were convicted of political offences, when somebody has been convicted and has served his or her time, he or she should not be penalised a second time.  The judge in deciding whether to hand down a sentence to a person for a serious offence such as one of those that was listed needs to be aware that there are consequences because Minister after Minister is putting increasingly more restrictions on people who have committed serious offences.  Some of these people have served ten or 20 years in prison.  They have been penalised and now they will be further penalised by having major restrictions imposed on their ability to rebuild their lives and, hopefully, be good, proper and upstanding citizens.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment and  to put pressure on Government to accept my proposal and that of my party to introduce legislation to deal with the legacy of political prisoners in this State.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted this amendment and I would like him to reconsider it.  What the legislation is doing is discriminating in an institutional way against people who are former political prisoners.  In the Twenty-six Counties at present, even without the legislation, ex-republican prisoners involved in the conflict and released under the Good Friday Agreement, who played a huge role in convincing many who were very sceptical about the process that it was the way forward and worked tirelessly around the clock to ensure the contents of the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and the Hillsborough Agreement became a reality, cannot get a job as a taxi or lorry driver.  With this omission the Bill allows this situation to continue.If the amendment were accepted it would send a tremendous message across the spectrum.  It would show political understanding and acceptance by the Dáil that what was done by people who were involved in the conflict and who are working for peace and justice throughout the island is different from other types of offences mentioned by the Minister.  The people themselves have no doubt that what they were involved in was politically motivated.  This is no different from generations who went before them from the first Dáil through to the present day.  If the people involved in military action against the Crown forces of occupation in the Twenty-six Counties were here today, they would find themselves in the same position as this generation of republican activists.This is an opportunity and I hope the Minister will not miss it.  It would send a clear message that people conforming to, accepting and helping to implement the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and the Hillsborough Agreement are proactively promoting and advancing the peace process and creating a political process whereby all of us with the desire to see the ultimate objective of what Irish republicanism stands for can achieve our aim.  I would hate to see the Minister miss this opportunity.  Whatever difficulties he has can be overcome in the context of universal acceptance in the political sphere on the island of Ireland with regard to people involved in the conflict at that time and who were motivated politically and not by selfish greed or violence.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The Minister made reference to the various offences and I found some of those references very insulting in many ways.  It is within his remit to accept the amendment which is very specific with regard to political prisoners under the Good Friday Agreement.  This is perfectly acceptable, and should be acceptable not only to those in the Minister's party but also in the Labour Party because it also affects them.  It affects some people in the Minister's party and in the Labour Party.  I do not know how they will vote on not accepting that people covered by the Good Friday Agreement should be exempt under this legislation.  I do not know how in conscience they could say it was all right for them in the past but it is not all right now.  This is a volte-face by people with a history in republicanism who were part of the struggle that took place on the island.It is not only the prisoners who served time who are affected.  Their families, friends and children are also being penalised.  This has happened and continues to do so.  The message has come out not only in the South but also in the North and it is a bad message.  We are all working very hard to support the St. Andrews Agreement.  There seems to be incremental erosion of the Good Friday Agreement and we need to put our foot down.  We cannot keep eroding the rights of people who took part in a struggle, many of whom were forced into it through circumstances.  I once again plead with the Minister to re-examine this, speak to his colleagues and not make a rash decision. This is very important.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I should clarify the provisions of the Bill.  There is an obligation to notify the Minister that convictions exist for these offences.  It does not automatically preclude somebody from being given a licence.  Having been notified, the Minister can consider particular convictions that affect good repute.  If he or she decides to refuse or withdraw a licence, applicants must be notified, at which point they have 21 days to appeal to the District Court.  I am sure it may well be the case that this Minister or future Ministers may take the view that such offences occurred long ago in a particular context and as a result would not preclude somebody from getting a licence.  It is not a ban on holding a licence.  It is a requirement that the Minister be notified of any such convictions.I do not want to get involved in history lessons but there is a big difference between the struggle of 1918 to 1921 and that in the period to which the Deputies refer.  The earlier struggle had democratic legitimacy whereas the struggle which occurred in recent times did not have the support of the majority of the people——

One of the problems that prevents us from doing this is the failure of the party opposite to admit to the crimes that occurred in the past.  I was really shocked during the presidential campaign by the behaviour of the Deputy First Minister.  A lady with eight or nine children was killed by the IRA because she assisted a soldier; I do not recall her name.

If I remember correctly the Deputy First Minister stated the family may think it was a murder and he would not disagree with them but he would not call it a murder.If we want to move on from this period in the past, what we need is an admission from Sinn Féin that these people are not heroes and the offences of which they were convicted were wrong and that they recognise these murders as murders.  If we had this type of statement it might be possible for me to reconsider my position on the amendment.  However, if the Deputies still pretend these offences were justified, or entirely politically motivated, or were not even murders, I do not think it is possible to draw a line under them.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	275	As we have had a sort of revisionist presentation from the Minister, I could take him to my county, to Ballyseedy or Beathacha, Caherciveen, or to Countess Bridge in Killarney where 17 prisoners were taken out in one week by the Minister's predecessors, tied to a mine and blown to bits in the name of this State, but I will not go down that road.  I am just making the point that in the 1918 to 1923 period there was a war in this State.  People were involved in that war on the island of Ireland.  The partition of Ireland was agreed by the Minister's predecessors.We are simply asking that people should be exempt, those who were involved in the conflict, who were part of a credible and verifiable ceasefire as part of the Good Friday Agreement, who were imprisoned as a result of that conflict and who were viewed by the British government and the Dublin government at that point in time as special category prisoners.  They were brought to special courts and to interrogation centres that were set up especially for people who were involved in the political struggle.  Therefore they are absolutely different.  The Minister can pick special incidents here and there, and so can I concerning the foundation of his party, but I will not go down that road.  We want to amend the legislation so that it does not discriminate against them because of their involvement in the conflict.  All we are seeking is that because they were involved in the conflict, they should not be discriminated against.  The Minister has an opportunity to send a powerful message to people who have come out of prison after spending long periods there.  Deputy Dessie Ellis spent 12 or 13 years in prison and I spent 13 years in prison, although I am no criminal.  I was never involved in criminal activity.  I know nobody who was in prison with me as a republican prisoner who was involved in criminal activity.  I did not want to go to prison or be involved in an armed campaign, but the conditions that were there in my time shaped my future, in the very same way as the future of people born in the Bogside was shaped — those who were 15, 16 or 17 years of age when British paratroopers came in a killed 14 people in 1972.  The consequences of repression and a sectarian one-party state created the situation that followed.  It was inevitable.  In the same way, in the 1918 to 1921 period, the consequences of the brutality of the British presence in this part of the country created the conditions where people — the forefathers of the Minister's party — were involved in terrible things.We need to work forwards from where we are now.  The Minister has an opportunity to try to ensure that we have equality of treatment for people who were caught up in something, not of their own making, but due to the circumstances prevailing on the ground at that point in time.  A huge job of work has been done by people like Mr. Martin McGuinness, Mr. Peter Robinson, Dr. Ian Paisley, Mr. David Trimble, previous governments here, Mr. George Mitchell, President Bill Clinton, Mr. Tony Blair and Mr. Gordon Brown.However, some of the Minister's commentary is insulting to say the very least.  I do not come in here to insult or downgrade him.  I ask him, as a legislator, to amend this legislation as part of conflict resolution, advancing the Good Friday Agreement, creating a circumstance, and sending a message out that we have drawn a line in the sand and have moved on from where we were.  That is the opportunity that is before the Minister.

Not all Ministers would have the same attitude as the current one in terms of saying that something is in the past, because there are no criteria and one could have a vindictive Minister in office.  There have been many in the past who would refuse point-blank to do so, by virtue of a person's history.  Rather than leaving it in a Minister's gift, it should be changed so that those who would qualify under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement as political prisoners should not have to inform the Minister.  If they inform the Minister, however, they can state that they would qualify.  The Minister can ring the Minister for Justice and Equality and say "Can you check this file?  Would this person, or has this person, come under the criteria that are set out?"  The criteria are very easy because the vast majority, if not all, of those who would qualify were in fact political prisoners who were convicted in Green Street courthouse in this State.  In the Six Counties they were convicted under the Diplock court system.  Both court systems were political and dealt specifically with those who were involved in offences that the state believed were political.  That is why they created a separate court and justice system, which allowed them in many ways to be railroaded into prison.Some of these people who were convicted were never involved in the activity for which they were convicted.  They may have been republicans or IRA members but the circumstances of the decision taken by the IRA in those years was, at times, not to recognise the court.  That meant that a defence was not even put up in some cases, and in many cases they were wrongfully convicted.  We have seen what wrongful convictions have done in key cases in England, such as the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.  Those are the cases we know of but there are quite a number of others.They were convicted of serious offences which, under this Bill, would mean that they would not qualify for exemption but would have to depend on a Minister having the cop-on or the political wit, or at least not being opposed to them, and saying "Yes, I understand".For instance, a member of the Labour Party, Mr. Nicky Kelly — although I do not know where his political allegiance is now — contested an election.  He was convicted in this State of a very serious offence.  If he had been elected to this House he would be in the same position of supporting me in my call for this amendment to be accepted, given what he went through and how long it took for him to be pardoned.  We could run a whole list of people and seek presidential pardons for quite a range of republican prisoners who were convicted of serious offences in the past 30 or 40 years, who would be discriminated against by this legislation.  That is not being sought, but we will pursue the issue of expunging the convictions in some legislation to be introduced in the near future.  In the meantime, however, the easy way of addressing the matter in these circumstances is that people who qualify under the terms of the prisoner release scheme under the Good Friday Agreement would also qualify under this Bill.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	277	In moving this amendment I did not really want to make political arguments.  However, some of the things the Minister said have put me in a position where I need to say certain things.  There was a conflict on this island and many things happened in that conflict.  Not all of us are happy, and are finding it very difficult, to stand by many of the things that happened, but they happened.  It was a very prolonged campaign and as a movement, as a party, we are in favour of a truth commission.  We want to see the truth come out in general.  Over the years the Government of this State stood by and allowed many things to happen. I will give an example of where the Government in this State failed the people in the North and in the whole island.  The intelligence services in this State worked closely, hand-in-glove, with the intelligence services in the North, whether it was through the Garda, the Army or otherwise.  Much of the information passed over to the Northern security services ended up in the hands of loyalists.The Government knew this was going on and we had the examples of the Littlejohns operating down here.  The British intelligence system was operating in the South unhindered, with no action taken against it.  The information sent across the Border to the Northern authorities ended, without doubt, in the deaths of civilians in the Northern part of our State and possibly in the South.I could go through many examples.  On the night of the attack on the Widow Scallan's pub, 300 people were nearly murdered and gardaí were sitting at the door.  They happened to move off and the loyalist death squad came in.  There are very serious questions to be answered about the role of this State in what happened over the years.  The Minister should not tell me that his Government and past Governments do not have to answer for something.  There is much to answer for.  I find some of the remarks deeply insulting.  They are revisionist, which is what has been going on in this State for so long.  It is time for the truth to come out.  My party and I are up for the truth and we will do our best to take part in that process.  Our leaders have indicated that.We are dealing with this amendment and it is important to send out a message that people and their families are not being abandoned.  They were dragged into a conflict that went on for a long time.  I am once again pleading with the Minister's party and people in the Labour Party who were involved in the conflict at an earlier stage.  I do not know how, in conscience, they can vote against an amendment like this.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	278	This provision is about notifying the Minister of offences committed.  At the time it is of course possible to notify the Minister that the persons involved are covered by the Good Friday Agreement.  That does not require legislative provision.  The Minister is obliged to take any representations into account.  Somebody can notify the Minister that he or she has a conviction for manslaughter, for example, but also say that he or she was released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Minister would then have to take that into account.  That provision is already there.What the Deputies opposite are saying is that now is the time to draw a line in the sand and say what is in the past is in the past.  To do that one must come to terms with the past and one's own history.  Deputy Ferris raised the issue of Ballyseedy, for example, and I have been there.  I can say, in clear conscience and without any doubt in my mind, that the events Ballyseedy constituted an atrocity.  I can also say that people who were murdered, or executed, without trial by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were murdered.  It was an atrocity and those people killed without a trial by the first Government were murdered.  That is my view.What the Members opposite need to be able to say is that Mrs. McConville was murdered and that the bombing at Enniskillen was an atrocity.  If they can say it in this House this afternoon, I will accept their amendment.

We need a truth commission because one of the problems is that in this State, the legacy of the conflict has not been addressed properly by those who are victims and those who carried out many of those actions which led to the death of people and which were absolutely and utterly wrong.  That should never have happened.  That includes actions such as Enniskillen and the killing of a mother of so many children.  There is a number of these and I can give a list.  Can we get the same type of response from the British Government and this State?  The issue is not just about Ballyseedy and much was carried out by this State against people.  There was the torture of people in Garda stations around the country and people were battered.  Some people were jailed in the wrong and there has been persecution in this State as well.  That is why we need a truth commission.It should involve our side and that of the Government.  There should be an acceptance that wrong was done and the heavy gangs should never have been set up and directed to brutalise republicans.  There were consequences for families and views against the State were entrenched.  That confirmed the history of republicanism versus the State since the foundation of the State.  There is a significant history lesson to be learned and as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, this is not necessarily the place for it.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I do not believe I said that.  I said I was independent.

We are trying to correct an issue before it causes a problem.  The Minister is correct in that a Minister has an obligation to take these factors into account but we do not want it to be an obligation.  It should not exist and the Minister should not have to deal with these people.  There should not be any form of restriction for the people we are talking about.  A Minister might take these issues into account and disregard them because of political views.  We do not want that position to emerge.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The Minister challenged me and my colleagues when he said that he would accept this amendment if we said X, Y and Z.  That is a disgraceful statement.  If he thinks he can blackmail me to say what he wants, he has another thing coming.  I could come in here and ask the Minister if the events at Abbeylara constituted murder or if the killing of Tom Smith in Portlaoise jail was murder.  What about the brutality against Colm Maguire, who died in the Dundrum mental hospital as a result of treatment in Portlaoise Prison?  His body was cremated so there would be no further autopsies.  I could nitpick many issues from the conflict but I will not go down that road.  We have the Good Friday Agreement, St. Andrews Agreement and the Hillsborough accord, all of which were achieved through negotiation.I know several people who had members of their family killed in very questionable circumstances but in the interests of peace and justice, I am prepared to accept people from every side in order to move forward.  Deputy Stagg sits in this House but the Government buried his brother in ten feet of concrete.  I remember it as if it was yesterday, as his body was hijacked at Shannon Airport and buried in concrete against the wishes of many members of his family.The Minister has indicated that he would accept the amendment if we said X, Y or Z.  It is a very shallow argument if the Minister is prepared to make that throwaway remark across the floor.  Things happened in war that are very hard to stand over.  There were issues with how the State dealt with republican prisoners in inhuman and degrading ways.  We are moving forward to bring about a lasting peace in this country for the first time and I am very honoured to be part of a movement that worked on this, along with elected representatives from the Government of the South, the British and American Governments and people of good will throughout the world.  If we all kept nitpicking, we would be absolutely nowhere.  There would be no Good Friday Agreement, St. Andrews Agreement or Hillsborough accord.  There was enough nitpicking at the time but we had to overcome it, put it behind us and move on.That is the challenge for all of us and the challenge for the Minister is on the merit of the argument for the amendment.  Is the Minister prepared to accept the amendment?  That is what the Minister has to tell this House.

In page 10, subsection (5)(a), line 39, after “licence” to insert “in respect of that service”.This is a technical amendment to clarify that not only must a consigner ensure that any operator he or she engages has an operator's licence but that it must be the right kind of operator's licence for the service intended to be carried out.  I propose that this amendment be accepted.There will now be some obligation on the consigner, who is the customer of the haulier, to ensure that the operator has the correct licence.  We were concerned that someone might argue in court, on a technicality, that they had a licence even though it was not the correct licence.

In page 10, subsection (5)(b), line 41, after “required” to insert “under subsection (7) or otherwise”.This is a technical amendment suggested by the Attorney General's office, to clarify that where any carriage of goods or persons is exempted under subsection (7) if a consigner engages someone to carry out such a carriage that person is not committing an offence.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I move amendment No. 4a:In page 11, before section 11, to insert the following new section:11.—(1) Where a vehicle is about to be used for the purposes of the road transport business of an operator under an operator's licence or a Community licence, the operator shall give to the person who is to act as driver of the vehicle while it is being so used a true copy of the licence or a certified copy of a Community licence, as the case may be, showing the vehicle to be authorised, and where appropriate a driver attestation, and those documents shall be kept in the vehicle.(2) A member of the Garda Síochána or a transport officer may demand of any person driving a vehicle which the member or transport officer believes to be engaging in road transport operations the production for inspection of a copy of the operator's licence or a certified copy of a Community licence showing the vehicle to be authorised and, where appropriate, a driver attestation.(3) Where any person driving a vehicle which the member or transport officer believes to be engaging in road transport operations—(a) fails or refuses to produce for inspection of a copy of the operator’s licence or a certified copy of a Community licence showing the vehicle to be authorised and, where appropriate, a driver attestation to a member of the Garda Síochána upon request, or(b) refuses or fails to permit such member or officer to read a copy of the operator’s licence or a certified copy of a Community licence showing the vehicle to be authorised and, where appropriate, the member or transport officer shall serve, or cause to be served, personally or by post, on the operator a notice under this section.(4) A transport disc shall be displayed on or affixed to the vehicle to which it relates in a visual manner so that it may be inspected by a transport officer or member of the Garda Síochána.(5) Where an inspection takes place by a transport officer or member of the Garda Síochána and transport disc is not displayed on or affixed to the vehicle to which it relates in accordance with subsection (4), the member or transport officer shall serve, or cause to be served, personally or by post, on the operator a notice under this section.".This amendment is somewhat technical in nature.  The desire is to take away the necessity to penalise drivers for not displaying licences.  Taking into account the small number of vehicles concerned, relative to the number of vehicles on the road, and recognising that the licence register is accessible on the Internet, the necessity to display a licence is not great and it is not necessary to levy a fine for not displaying a licence.  That is what the amendment seeks to address.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I thank the Deputy for the amendment.  The intention of section 11, as originally proposed, is to support enforcement by the Garda and transport officers in relation to licensed and unlicensed operators and vehicles which are not authorised on licence.  This requires that the appropriate documentation be carried in the vehicle for this purpose.  Penalties for not doing so act as a deterrent.  It is essential that people carry documentation in their vehicles.  If they did not it would make enforcement more difficult.  On that basis, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I will not push the matter to a vote.  The provision in the Bill hankers back to a bygone era when if one was presented with something one carried it as a token of its existence.  With the advent of the Internet, online access makes the question of who is licensed abundantly clear.  Other road transport legislation requires that people display their NCT certificates, insurance discs and tax discs, but we can move away from this regulatory burden and paper processing at some point, given that most, if not all, of the data are contained in electronic format.  It will not be long before law enforcement officers will have access to the Internet from their vehicles to determine whether someone has insurance.  This is already the case in other jurisdictions.There is a necessity to present an insurance disc or other item of motor vehicle "jewellery", as it is called, but many of the documents in question are forged to a high standard.  Therefore, the mere presentation of them by the driver or their presence on the dashboard does not ensure that the driver is a bona fide operator.  I will not object to this provision's presence in the legislation, but the Department needs to examine the regulatory regime and recognise that, where many of the documents are concerned, the potential for forgery is real.  The requirement that an individual carry a licence or face a fine is unnecessary and moves us away from the resolution to the matter, namely, faster access to the back-end database maintained by the Department or a regulatory authority.  This access would make it easier for law enforcement agents to decide at an early stage whether someone was compliant.

This legislation is the first time the information in question will be allowed to be published online.  To the best of my knowledge, gardaí and transport officers do not have access to the Internet in their cars.  Access can be poor on some of our roads.  I am not ready to accept the amendment.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	300	That is okay.

In page 14, subsection (3)(a), line 22, before “(in” to insert the following:", including the engagement or use by a person in the premises or place of the services of an undertaking for the carriage by road for reward of goods or persons in a vehicle".This is another technical amendment to include an existing provision that a transport officer of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, can enter the premises of a consignor to inspect a haulier's vehicle therein for the purpose of inspecting vehicles, tachograph machines or documents.  As this section is based on section 16 of the 1986 Act, it repeats an amendment made to the latter section by section 14 of the 1999 Act.  It allows transport officers employed by the RSA to enforce this legislation.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	302	On Second Stage, the Minister was helpful in identifying the exemptions provided for in statutory instruments or other legislation that are not included in this Schedule.  Does he intend to codify in a Schedule all of the pursuits that do not require licences?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	303	It is probably too early to answer the question, but the intention in next year's road transport Bill will be to update and consolidate existing legislation.  Perhaps that will be the opportunity to have a revised Schedule of exempted businesses.  Suffice it to say that those listed by the Deputy yesterday remain exempt.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Section 2 provides that passenger transport operators must notify the Minister of any potential conflict in respect of drivers, but the same provision does not apply to road hauliers.  On Second Stage, I sought the Minister's guidance as to why this was the case.  I can understand the importance of a driver who carries passengers being of good and sound repute, but the same requirement should apply to drivers in the road haulage sector.  The example I supplied was of someone who had been convicted of drug trafficking being a director, owner, operator or other category of person in respect of whom notification must be made for the purpose of issuing a licence.  It is clear that someone could cease to be a director of an undertaking and become a driver instead.  Surely the legislation should provide the Minister with the ability to refuse or remove an operator's licence where that operator employs or contracts a driver convicted of the crimes in question.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	305	My apologies for not addressing this matter in my closing remarks yesterday.  I am advised that passenger drivers are covered because they have unaccompanied access to children, old people and vulnerable people who they could harm.  This is not the case with haulage drivers, who chiefly drive trucks on their own and are accompanied by their goods, not passengers.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I would understand it if we were just discussing the potential to cause harm or a conviction for inappropriate sexual activity, for example, sex with a minor, but drug trafficking is also one of the serious offences laid out in the Bill.  I do not understand why the Minister has decided that a driver's conviction for a drug offence, such as the importation of drugs, would cause harm to passengers on a bus.  It would have greater implications for people driving for international hauliers, given the potential for them to carry on their illicit practices of old.  I do not intend to push the matter by way of amendment, but the Minister should consider it ahead of next year's proposed transport Bill.  There is no great difference.  Indeed, it is probably of greater importance in the case of the carriage of goods, particularly given that the offence might relate to a conviction for drug trafficking.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I must give that matter some consideration.  It is an argument I have not heard before and I must confer with my officials on it.  If there is a lacuna or an anomaly, perhaps we can address it in the Seanad by means of a Government amendment or in legislation next year.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	311	The Minister stated: "The problem I face is that a large number of interest groups, including local authorities, county managers, Deputies, Senators and councillors, all want me to continue to spend lots of money on planning for projects that we cannot afford to build for perhaps ten or 20 years."  The Minister noted a good suggestion from a Deputy that towns in need of bypasses that we can no longer afford should try to develop interim plans for traffic management through those towns.  For future reference, I refer to the case of Ross, where under no circumstances can we afford to build a bypass.  A relief bridge in the town would be a cheaper option and would suffice, given that the bypass is unlikely to be built in the next ten or 20 years.

The Department and the NRA are open to proposals on how things could be done more cheaply.  Even where interim and cheaper options are presented, they tend to cost a few million euro.  We do not even have this.

In page 4, to delete lines 3 to 20 and substitute the following:"2.—(1) Notwithstanding the generality of any other enactment or rule of law and subject to subsections (2) and (3), it shall not be an offence for a person who is in his or her dwelling, or for a person who is a lawful occupant in a dwelling, to use force against another person or the property of another person where—(a) he or she believes the other person has entered or is entering the dwelling as a trespasser for the purpose of committing a criminal act, and(b) the force used is only such as is reasonable and proportional in the circumstances as he or she believes them to be—(i) to protect himself or herself or another person present in the dwelling from imminent injury, assault, detention or death caused by a criminal act,(ii) to protect his or her property or the property of another person from imminent appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act, or(iii) was necessary to prevent the commission of a crime or to effect, or assist in effecting, a lawful arrest.".I am sure the Minister is aware that the amendments before us are the same as those I submitted on Committee Stage.  Ordinarily I would not resubmit the same amendments on Report Stage but having discussed them on Committee Stage I felt I would have to table them again.  On Committee Stage I listened carefully to the Minister's arguments for not accepting the amendments and I subsequently read the transcript of the committee meeting.  Having done so I felt further discussion was needed on section 2 as we still have some concerns about how the Bill is being presented.Amendment No. 1 proposes to delete section 2(1)(a) and (b).  As I stated on Committee Stage, in deciding if an individual is justified in using force, a two prong test comprising subjective and objective elements is provided.  It was pointed out on Committee Stage that to satisfy the subjective test, the householder need only believe the force used is reasonable in the circumstances as he sees them.  In this respect, it does not matter if the force can be justified or not if the person honestly believed it was reasonable in the circumstances.  To satisfy the objective tests on whether an individual honestly believed the force used was reasonable, a jury will be asked to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds after taking into account all relevant circumstances.  I said on Committee Stage that we believe the lack of reference in the Bill to proportionality, necessity and imminence meant the objective test set out in the Bill was not robust enough and did not comply with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.On Committee Stage, in response to the amendment, the Minister said:In addition, the approach in the Bill reflects the well known judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in DPP v. Barnes.  The test of reasonableness in fact incorporates elements such as imminence, necessity and proportionality, which are referred to in the amendment.I appreciate the purpose of the Deputy's amendment might be an attempt to tighten up the circumstances in which force can be used [but] it is likely the amendment would in fact have the effect of imposing additional tests to those already prescribed in the Bill.The Minister went on to say:The Bill is based on the approach of reasonableness [that] already incorporates elements such as necessity, imminence and proportionality  If, for example, an action is taken that is disproportionate, it is highly unlikely [when] taking all factors into account, that it would considered reasonable.For these reasons the Minister would not accept the amendment.Having read that, I consider the Minister was contradictory.  He stated our amendment, which adds the elements of imminence, necessity and proportionality, would have the effect of prescribing additional tests to that of reasonableness.   He then went on to state that the test of reasonableness already incorporates the elements of imminence, necessity and proportionality.  If that is the case and they are already incorporated, what is the problem with including them in legislation so every person is clear this is what is needed to satisfy that test?  I also ask the Minister to state what additional tests he thinks the amendment will bring if this is the reason he opposes it.Stating that an action that is disproportionate is highly unlikely to be considered reasonable is not good enough.  Highly unlikely means it is not beyond the realms of possibility that a disproportionate action could be considered reasonable under this Bill.  If the purpose of the Bill is to provide clarity, it will fail if our amendment is not included and will likely be of no use to the Minister.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	317	We already dealt with this matter in some detail on Committee Stage.  The Deputy says he has tabled the same amendment again.  What he leaves out in his comment where he refers to the transcript of what was said on Committee Stage is a reference to the exclusion from the provision he has tabled to a very important aspect of this particular legislation, section 2(1)(a).  Before someone engages in the use of force, he or she must believe the other person has entered or is entering the dwelling as a trespasser for the purpose of committing a criminal offence.  It was the reference to and omission of the fact that someone was trespassing on the property of another, particularly the family home.  Violation of the family home by trespass is a crucial element in the matter with regard to someone engaging to defend themselves or their home in a reasonable way.  Having explained that to the Deputy, I would have believed that, in resubmitting an amendment, he would have ensured that it incorporated the matter omitted from the amendment discussed on Committee Stage.  The change he seeks to make would effect a fundamental change in the purpose and intent of the legislation, that is, to ensure that people do not trespass inside the dwelling home of individuals.  The very fact of trespass in the context of the judgment of Mr. Justice Hederman in the case he referred to was regarded as an aggressive violation of someone’s rights by virtue of illegal entry into the home.  The Deputy has not addressed that issue.On the specific issue raised, it was already said that the amendment was discussed on Committee Stage when it was noted that the section and the entire Bill have been drafted on the basis of applying the test of reasonableness.  This test is well known in our law and has been interpreted by the courts.  The Deputy referred to the judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of DPP v. Barnes.  During the debate on Committee Stage, Deputy O’Brien stated that the purpose of the amendment, which he has reiterated today, was to provide for a test of imminence and proportionality by way of express provisions.  He stated on Committee Stage that this would make the section more robust.  The approach the Deputy now proposes would alter the reasonableness test provided for in the Bill, which test is known to the courts.The Deputy is trying to say that what I am saying is contradictory.  The reasonableness test, through existing jurisprudence, incorporates the concepts of imminence, necessity and proportionality.  It can also be broader in that something else might arise that would be of relevance to a reasonableness test of the manner in which someone responds to a burglary in his home.  What the Deputy would be doing would be moving discretion from the court to determine in a global context whether someone has objectively behaved reasonably.  In the circumstances, I can no more accept the Deputy's amendment on Report Stage than I could on Committee Stage.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The Minister said on Committee Stage that an action that is disproportionate would be highly unlikely to be considered reasonable.  Does he not agree that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a disproportionate action could be considered reasonable under the Bill?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The proportionality of response in this context is important in determining whether someone has behaved reasonably.  There may be circumstances where there is imminence and a necessity to respond and where, due to the subjective perception of the individual and out of fear, he may conduct himself in a manner that others distanced from the event may objectively view as disproportionate.  However, in the round and overall, this behaviour may be considered reasonable because of the background circumstances.  This is a very complex issue which, in the context of individual cases, will require an examination of the individual circumstances.  That is why the reasonableness test involves a broader concept which includes the three factors about which the Deputy is concerned, but which may include more.There could be a suggestion that an individual has behaved somewhat disproportionately.  In determining whether an individual should be convicted, the overall background circumstances, the individual's personal perception of the level of threat and the conduct of the trespasser would all be issues to be considered under the reasonableness test.  If the absence of one of the three criteria meant that there could be no justifiable defence of an individual charged with behaving in a violent manner towards a burglar, it would add an artificial difficulty to the workings of the law and a huge difficulty in ensuring that the circumstances in the round were fully considered by a court.  It is in that context that I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.I return to the fundamental flaw in the Deputy's amendment, namely, his omission of the entire subsection to deal with trespassing, which is the kernel of the legislation.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Where an action may be considered disproportionate, is the Minister saying that the amendment cannot be accepted because there may be circumstances in which only two out of the three criteria we seek to insert are met?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	321	By and large, it is my view that the three factors — imminence, necessity and proportionality — will have to be complied with but that there may be exceptional circumstances in a particular case in respect of which, despite an individual's failure to fully meet one of the criteria, a court may hold the view that his behaviour or conduct was reasonable in the specific circumstances that rose in the context of the overall background, the individual's overall state of mind and perception of threat to himself or a family member.  Reasonableness is a test that the courts have already applied and are familiar with.  It is the better way of dealing with the matter.  Leaving that aside, the Deputy's amendment is, unfortunately, flawed in that it omits addressing the trespass issue and, as a consequence, would have a fundamental impact on the purpose of the legislation.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 5, to delete lines 10 and 11 and substitute the following:"(7) Notwithstanding the provisions set out in Section 2, the use of force shall exclude the use of force causing death except in circumstances where it is absolutely necessary.(8) Notwithstanding the provisions set out in Section 2, the defence of private property shall not be a legitimate reason for the use of fatal force.”.We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage and I have retabled it because we mis-worded it on Committee Stage.  Section 2(7) states: "The use of force shall not exclude the use of force causing death".  On Committee Stage the Minister said:I will focus briefly on the aspect of the amendment which would introduce a new subsection (3).  It appears the intention of this is to exclude private property from the use of force causing death.  This aspect of the amendment alone would defeat the entire purpose of the Bill.  Subsection (11) states, "For the avoidance of doubt, a reference in this section to property includes, unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to a dwelling".  Hence, a dwelling obviously is an individual's property.  The Bill, as it stands, does not allow for the use of lethal force in defence of private property per se.  The purpose of this Bill is to recognise the special position of the dwelling in law as recognised by the common law and as explained in some detail by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Barnes case and, not least, as embedded in the Constitution, which guarantees in Article 40.5 that “The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law”.Having carefully studied and considered what the Minister said, I believe his analysis is incorrect when he says the Bill does not permit the use of lethal force per se in the defence of private property.  Section 2(1)(b)(ii) on the justifiable use of force states it is legal to use force “to protect his or her property or the property of another person from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act”.  Section 2(7) states, “The use of force shall not exclude the use of force causing death.”  From my reading it is clear that the Bill allows for the use of lethal force in the defence of private property without the accompanying threat to persons within that property.  If it is the Minister’s intention to only allow the use of lethal force in defence of private property where the defence of that property forms part of a defence of persons within it, the Bill should state this clearly.  On Committee Stage the Minister said:It is worth recalling that in the Barnes case, Mr. Justice Hardiman referred to a burglary, entering someone else's house, as essentially an act of aggression.  To be precise, he stated:Every burglary in a dwellinghouse is an act of aggression.  The circumstances may make this element of aggression more or less patent but the violation of a citizen's dwellinghouse is just that, a violation and an act of aggression no matter what the other circumstances.Lethal force would, of course, only be reasonable to use in exceptional circumstances and only where it was proportionate to the threat with which someone was confronted.  For example, if an attacker was attempting to firebomb a family home, it would be reasonable to use very strong force to prevent that attack so as to protect the lives of those in the home.  The Deputy's proposed amendment would prevent the householder from using such force as his or her protection of the home would constitute the defence of private property.We do not dispute the constitutional inviolability of the dwelling.  However, we dispute the ability of a person to be able to take the life of another in defence of that dwelling.  The Bill clearly permits the use of lethal force in cases in which there is a threat to private property.  We do not believe it is correct to place the same value on a life as on bricks and mortar.  On Committee Stage the Minister used the example of someone attempting to firebomb a house and a person using lethal force to defend the lives of those within it, which is a completely different scenario because the threat is different — it is to the life of somebody within the home.  However, if the home is empty, the threat is just to the bricks and mortar.Amendment No. 2 would not prevent somebody from taking reasonable and necessary action to defend himself, herself or other persons.  It is to prevent someone from using lethal force where the risk is simply to the bricks and mortar.  For example, if a person is standing in his or her garden and another person attempts to set fire to the home which is empty, that does not pose the same threat as somebody attempting to firebomb a home when the family is inside it and different rules should apply.  We do not claim a person cannot use lethal force, but when it is used, there must be a threat to the life of the person or his or her family within the private property, not just a threat to the private property.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	323	In dealing the Deputy's previous amendment, I misread a note on the trespass issue.  Of course, that amendment did incorporate the trespass matter which had been the subject of exchanges on Committee Stage.  That would not have made the Deputy's amendment any more acceptable for the reasons I gave with regard to the application of the test of reasonableness.As for the amendment before us, again a similar amendment was considered on Committee Stage.  I must oppose this amendment once again because it fails to take proper account of the wider provisions of the Bill.  Section 2(7) does not stand in isolation.  Section 2(1)(b) is clear when it states “the force used is only such as is reasonable”.  That is an objective test.  A jury or a court ultimately will determine whether force used is reasonable, should the matter arise.  Where lethal force is used unnecessarily, it will be unreasonable.  As has been noted previously, the concept of reasonable force is well known to Irish jurisprudence and embodies the concepts of necessity and proportionality.  The aspect of the amendment which would introduce a new subsection (8) would defeat the entire purpose of the Bill.  Section 2(11) states “For the avoidance of doubt, a reference in this section to property includes, unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to a dwelling.”  As it stands, the Bill does not allow for the use of lethal force in defence of private property per se.  The purpose of the Bill is to recognise the special position of the dwelling in law, as recognised by the common law, confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Barnes case and not least, as embodied in the Constitution, which in Article 40.5 guarantees “The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and should not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law”.  Lethal force would only be reasonable to use in exceptional circumstances and only where it was proportionate to the threat faced.  In light of this, I cannot accept the Deputy’s amendment.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	324	This goes back to one reason for tabling the first amendment, which was to include the tests of imminence, necessity and proportionality the Minister has decided not to include.  However, were the Bill to pass as it stands, my reading of it is that in effect, Members will have placed the same level of importance on the life of a person as on private property.  If this is the case, it completely contravenes Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Minister stated on Committee Stage that he received guidance from the Attorney General to the effect that this Bill is in line with Article 2 of the aforementioned convention.  However, Article 2 states that the State is obliged to take appropriate measures to safeguard human life.  This places a positive obligation on the State to provide a legal regime that effectively protects the lives of all persons present on the territory of Ireland.  Moreover, the State must prohibit unlawful killing and punish it by criminal sanctions.  Again, on Committee Stage, speakers referred to the stress placed by the Law Reform Commission on the importance of maintaining a proportionality component on the right to use force in the defence of a home, as well as reasonable limits in respect of that right.  Sinn Féin agrees completely with this analysis but I believe this Bill to be flawed, in that it does not comply with Article 2.  The Minister should reconsider this point because while I do not suggest one cannot use lethal force, I make the point that one cannot place the same level of importance on someone's life as one does on bricks and mortar.  Any democracy that does that is on a slippery slope.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The Deputy essentially is revisiting the issues dealt with on Committee Stage.  For the reasons I gave, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  The Deputy has raised issues about the European Court of Human Rights and was correct to cite me as having stated that the legislation has been proofed in that context by the Attorney General and that I have been advised the legislation is in order.  In the context of case law from the European Court of Human Rights, I also am satisfied that the legislation is in order.I revert to the issue.  It arises specifically under section 2(1) and the wording thereof, which states:Notwithstanding the generality of any other enactment or rule of law and subject to subsections (2) and (3), [the key point is] it shall not be an offence for a person who is in his or her dwelling, or for a person who is a lawful occupant in a dwelling, to use force against another person or the property of another person.It goes on in section 2(1)(a) to specify where “he or she believes the other person has entered or is entering the dwelling as a trespasser for the purpose of committing a criminal [offence]” and in section 2(1)(b):the force used is only such as is reasonable in the circumstances as he or she believes them to be—(i) to protect himself or herself or another person present in the dwelling from injury, assault, detention or death caused by a criminal act,(ii) to protect his or her property or the property of another person from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act, or(iii) to prevent the commission of a [criminal act].One has then brought in the objective test of reasonableness to this issue.  Essentially, lethal force can only be used, in the way the courts may well see it, in circumstances where it is reasonable and that will be in exceptional circumstances.  Moreover, it must be used in the context of an individual being the occupant of a dwelling or being in his or her dwelling.  Consequently, where I occupy a dwelling or am in my dwelling and there is a trespass, in the vast majority of instances, lethal force would not be appropriate.  However, the test of reasonableness will apply, as will its other subtexts of imminence, proportionality and necessity, and the law as it is now being proposed to be enacted in the Bill will be on all fours with the approach taken in case law dealing with the reasonableness test.  For these reasons I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment, which effectively would undermine the principles behind the Bill, namely, to ensure that individuals can regard their homes as their castles and can use reasonable force in circumstances in which there has been a trespass.That said, I repeat a point I made on Committee Stage, because I think it is important.  The Bill is not an invitation to individuals to put themselves in harm's way.  People who have a burglar in their home may well, under the Bill following its enactment, for reasons of protecting themselves or their family lawfully defend themselves using reasonable force.  However, there will be many instances in which people's homes are burglarised or in which there is an intruder in the home, where there may be a disproportionate age gap between the intruder and the occupant of the home.  The intruder may be an individual of violent disposition or may be an individual who is high on drugs and who has no capacity to assess a situation and make any judgments that could be relied on.  For many people who discover an intruder in the home, leaving the home, telephoning the Garda Síochána and seeking assistance may be a better and preferred option to that of engaging with the intruder.However, the Bill does something that is important.  It gives a statutory framework to the constitutional recognition of the inviolability of an individual's dwelling house.  In that context, it will ensure that where someone's dwelling house is violated, where someone's home is being burglarised, where people feel themselves or their families to be under threat, they can address this threat, if they have the capacity to so do, in a manner that is reasonable and proportionate to deal with a threat that is imminent and poses a serious risk to their safety or where there is a risk of loss of property or, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, where there may be a risk of their homes being burned down.There is a whole range of circumstances to which this will apply.  However, the nature of the response of the person residing in the home, and the extent to which it is reasonable, will be determined by an objective test.  That provides the protection necessary.  It recognises the right of individuals to live peacefully in their homes without unlawful intrusion while ensuring, if there is such unlawful intrusion, that they respond reasonably to it.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The Minister referred to section 2(1)(b).  We are not disputing that there may be cases where lethal force has to be used to protect oneself, one’s family or individuals within the home.  However, it is not correct to say the Bill would not exclude the use of lethal force just to protect private property — bricks and mortar.  Section 2(1)(b)(ii) states: “to protect his or her property or the property of another person from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act”.  That is the subsection we have an issue with.  We do not believe it is robust enough and it does not comply with Article 2.  For that reason, we will seek a vote on the amendment.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the revised capital expenditure programme published the week before last in the context of the upcoming budget.  The fact that we must have a considerably downsized revised programme will be a source of disappointment for Members on all sides of the House and members of the public, particularly those whose jobs are very much bound up with a robust capital expenditure programme.  Their disappointment is shared by Members of this side of the House.  There is no Government which does not consider providing national infrastructure to meet future needs in the economic life and development of the country to be an essential part of its responsibility.The Government is no different from any household in terms of its freedom to spend.  Many householders look around to assess the state of their homes and see that money needs to be spent on them, whether it be on painting the windows, or renewing, enhancing or repairing their homes.  They know that if they do not do this work, it will have repercussions in the future in that it might cost them more in that further repairs might have to be done.  They know, however, that one cannot spend what one does not have or what one cannot borrow.  That is precisely the position the Government is in; it does not have the money and cannot borrow it.It is a tragedy that we cannot provide for the future needs of the economy in terms of the provision of infrastructure.  There is no way to dress this up.  A failure to invest now will limit our future growth prospects, make us less efficient and competitive.  It will also mean we will fail to capitalise on the reduced cost of construction work.  Sadly, it means many potential and existing jobs will be sacrificed and the loss of professional expertise and skills which we built up in the past 15 or 20 years.  Many engineers, architects, quantity surveyors, carpenters, plumbers, welders and painters have lost their jobs and will continue to lose jobs in the coming years because of the need to cut back on our capital expenditure programme.The loss of the skills we have built up is the saddest aspect.  The tragedy of what was done to us is that we will lose the talented teams which gave us the Boyne bridge and the complex interchanges on the motorways.  One of the good things that happened during the Celtic tiger years is that we built the inter-urban routes.  We will also lose the teams which delivered the Luas.  The people with these skills have gone abroad to build a prosperous future for other people in Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Africa.  We are paying a heavy price as a country and as individuals for the mistakes and greed of others.The reality is that we must remove €3.8 billion from the budget this year.  This can be done only through cutting expenditure or increasing taxes.  None of these options are ones which any Government relishes.  What I am here to speak about today is the fact that we have €4 billion to spend this year, which is a great deal of money in the context of what is available overall.  When one has a limited amount of money it is important to prioritise and spend it as it should be spent.People were disappointed that funding was pulled from the metro project, particularly because so much money had been spent on planning it.  However, a huge project like this is risky at the best of times and in the worst of times it would be far too risky even if one had the money for it, because if it went wrong it would go monumentally wrong, and would be tied around the necks of future generations like another Anglo Irish Bank.  It was sensible to pull back from it.I am pleased to see money will be spent on joining up the two Luas lines and extending the line to Broombridge which will allow for an interchange with the Maynooth line and the main rail network.  What is important in public transport is not individual lines but that we provide a network of facilities.Iarnród Éireann is probably disappointed with the unavailability of money for the DART underground but to be honest I have always had reservations about this.  It is not that I do not think it is a great idea to join up the system because this is essential, but to do it underground in a small city is not a good idea.  All of the evidence from abroad suggests that people will not go underground for very short journeys.  I am not convinced this was ever going to be a good investment, notwithstanding that it is essential that we join up the network.What we can do now, we should do.  For instance, the Luas project to join up the lines was postponed originally because it would cause disruption in the city and we already had gridlock at that point.  Now, at a time of recession when there is less economic activity, less traffic and less travel, is the time to do it, notwithstanding that it will cause some disruption.I already welcomed the fact that in the years gone by we completed the inter-urban routes and what money is available now must be concentrated on public transport.  Dublin Bus has had to reduce its services, which is being sold in Dublin as streamlining and it probably should have been done years ago.  The fact that it could not replace buses meant it had fewer buses on the road.  The investment in replacing buses was essential and was well-judged and focused on where it was really needed.I urge the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to look towards cheaper but very successful alternatives such as the rapid bus transport systems which are cheaper and offer greater flexibility in a built-up city and provide greater penetration in built-up areas.  People may not feel it is as sexy as getting an underground DART or a metro but they work and are infinitely cheaper so we should consider them in terms of providing an overall network.I will speak a little about health because it is in the news so much at present.  I very much welcome the fact that although there is less money now and the choices are stark we are prioritising projects such as the children's hospital which is long anticipated and badly needed.  I am pleased the Government is prioritising children through creating the role of Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and keeping them high on the political agenda.  The funding mechanism for the national children's hospital is innovative as it involves selling the licence for the national lottery.  I hope it works and that the troika allows us to keep the money from it.  We probably need to get clarification on this in the new year.I am also pleased that Dundrum Mental Hospital is to be replaced.  When the old health boards existed, I was on the visiting committee and we visited many facilities in the area.  The mental hospital in Dundrum was Dickensian.  It houses many dangerous people but they are all patients.  They are all sick people and to keep them in the conditions in which they have been kept for many years is unacceptable.  Therefore, I am pleased money is being made available for this.  I look forward to seeing the patients transferred to a new facility in Portrane.I very much welcome the fact that a certain amount of the limited money available for education has been ring-fenced to provide for the many new schools we will need in the coming years to cater for our expanding population.  We should view this expanding population as a plus; we need to replace ourselves as we do not want to end up in the same position as many other countries with an aging and expensive population.  We need young people coming into the workforce in years to come  — I hope in better times than these — to keep us all in our old age.  I look forward to this and it is right that we spend our money now on education.I am delighted to see that almost €500 million will be spent in the coming year on job creation.  It is essential that we continue to invest through the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to attract businesses to Ireland.  We must remain an attractive place to locate.  It is not only money and grants which does this; the essential investment in a secure water supply, telecommunications and energy are also required if we are to continue to compete to attract a flow of inward investment.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject.  I recognise that we do not have the level of expenditure for these areas that we might have liked or that we had in the past.  Some reduction was possibly necessary in capital expenditure and other expenditure headings, but the document in front of us, which was published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, last week, goes a little too far and deep with regards to cuts in capital expenditure.It was intended to spend approximately 3.5% of GNP on capital expenditure in 2012 but this document cuts this figure to 3%.  The 2011 budget for capital expenditure is €4.65 billion.  We proposed that this should be reduced by approximately €350 million to approximately €4.3 billion and everybody accepted this.  The document proposes to cut this figure to €3.9 billion which reduces total capital expenditure next year by €750 million compared to this year.  That immediately translates into people who are working on the €4.6 billion worth of projects this year in order that approximately 9,000 fewer people will be working on those jobs next year.  That is because the budget for capital expenditure in 2012 will be cut to €3.9 billion.  It surprised me that twice in one week the Minister went public with new documents of this nature.  Just a few days after that he came up with another figure, saying that he would cut public service numbers by far more than was previously understood to be the case — another 12,000.  I understand it is a coalition Government and there have to be compromises.  I also understand that Fine Gael wants to cut the public service right, left and centre but it was disappointing that the Minister went so far down the Fine Gael road on that particular issue.As regards the limited resources available to us, it is a question of how one prioritises the amount of money one has.  I think the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will support me on this important point.  The first chart in this report's executive summary shows that roads and public transport will get 25% of this infrastructure and capital investment programme in the next couple of years.  Environment and housing will receive approximately 19%.  Much of the environment budget concerns waste water treatment services, with which we all agree.  Meanwhile only 13% is being invested in the future of education.  More disappointingly, however, health is only getting 11% of the €3.9 billion next year and from the €17 billion in the programme.  As a percentage of expenditure and the Government's priorities, health has therefore been relegated to one of the smallest levels of any Department.  I would have thought that health warrants a higher priority, as should education.  However, the Government has chosen to give 25% of the entire capital programme to roads and transport, as well as another 25% to housing and the environment.  At the same time, we are spending less on health and education combined than on roads.We have a massive roads infrastructure and I would like to see extra road projects.  We have built motorways and additional Luas lines as well as toll bridges, underpasses, overpasses and flyovers.  That infrastructure is a credit to where we are today and it helps competitiveness, but in times of scarce resources I thought that health and education would have featured more strongly in terms of the Government's priorities.  If capital expenditure in 2012 is to be €3.9 billion, then so be it.  I would like it to be more but that is a Government decision.  Within that figure, however, I am disappointed that health and education are to receive so little.  I would like to concentrate on those kinds of issues and I would support a rejigging of priorities within the overall budget to give greater priority to health and education.  If children do not get a good education, it will cause difficulties later.  Equally, older people also need to be looked after.  Deputy Stanley and I were with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, last night talking about the closure of nursing homes for the elderly in Abbeyleix and Shane.  The Minister was convincing and I was happy with the outcome of the meeting because what he is trying to do sounds positive.  Although it is running against this direction, he wants to maintain as many people in HSE facilities for the elderly as possible.  That can be done for a small extra amount.  I know HIQA has new standards coming in but the figures being brought forward in that area would be a tremendous boost for the health services which need it.As the main Opposition spokesperson on the public service, I told the Minister that we would support lifting the recruitment embargo for nurses.  I think everybody in the House would support such a move because that embargo is causing the problem with all those nursing homes.  Nurses are retiring and are entitled to do so as part of the agreement by moving out before next spring.  If teachers or doctors retire, they are replaced, as psychiatrists and psychologists can be.  By and large, teachers are exempt from the recruitment embargo, although some posts are not, such as non-teaching principals and assistant principals.  Generally, however, if a mainstream teacher leaves a classroom, that teacher will be replaced and the same applies to doctors, surgeons and consultants.  We now need to do the same for nurses.  We would therefore support a reallocation of priorities within the budget to help health services and the education sector.There is no mention of job loss or creation figures in this infrastructure and capital investment programme.  None the less everything we are doing now should be focused on jobs, which is the biggest issue.  The more people we get back to work, the fewer we will be paying on social welfare.  The priority should be about jobs, although there is nothing in the programme about that, apart from job reductions.  The same applies to the other public sector reform document I mentioned.  There is nothing in it apart from job reductions.It is intended to raid the National Pensions Reserve Fund for another €250 million.  Last July, €500 million was raided by way of the pension levy, but that money was not spent on job creation.  In fact, the majority of it has still not been spent.  I know people on the Government side are smiling at me but those are the facts.  More than €200 million of that has not been spent, although they say it will be spent next year.  That may be so but the money is being deducted this year for job creation, yet it is not being spent.  The Government is upfront and accepts that the money has not been spent.  It is in the Government figures which were produced at the end of September.  Nonetheless the Government reduced VAT in that jobs initiative to increase employment.  However, it is now proposing to increase VAT in the forthcoming budget.  People may say it has not been decided but we know it has been.  As that will cost jobs, I cannot understand where the Government stands on jobs.  It reduces VAT to help job creation but then turns round with the biggest macroeconomic statement of the year to announce a VAT increase.  By definition that will cost more jobs.  When one adds up the loss of jobs in this infrastructure and capital investment programme and those announced by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, last week for public service reductions, which are greater than those ever planned by the Labour Party or Fianna Fáil going into the last election, as well as job losses as a direct result of the budget, it is worrisome that priority is not being given to jobs.I would like to see this plan being fleshed out further.  Where construction work is going ahead, including on school buildings, a mechanism should be put in place so that small and medium-sized local businesses will get an opportunity to tender for such jobs.  Most tendering bodies, whether they are local authorities, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills or other Departments, only want companies that have had a massive turnover in the previous year to be allowed to tender.  The majority of companies that are well capable of doing this work are not even allowed to tender at the moment.  As a result, big companies are getting all the work while small and medium-sized companies lose out, although they do provide local employment.  For example, in County Laois about four or five schools are under construction but not one of the contractors comes from Laois, and some of them do not even come from Leinster.  They are coming from all over the place.It is well documented in the Department of Education and Skills that people who are in the black economy are working on every publicly funded contract in County Laois.  The main contractor employs subcontractors who, in turn, employ other subcontractors, and they employ people who are on the dole.  They are working at a cheap rate.  I have documented these matters regularly and have given examples to the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, is having a meeting on that issue because if they are publicly funded contracts, we must ensure that people in the white economy get those jobs, not those in the black economy.  People who want to work properly should not be disadvantaged by those working in the black economy.  I do not even need to put it on the record here because it is well documented in the Department of Education and Skills by way of correspondence.  When I make statements like that, I always back them up.I welcome the fact that we have a plan but I am disappointed that priority has not been given to health and education.

#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on the important issue of public expenditure and reform.  When the textbooks of modern Irish history are written, and there has been much analysis in recent times, they will clearly show the inability of the last Government to manage our finances correctly.  We have been left in the situation that we are now in, but we can see how the proceeds of the property bubble were used to fuel a bloated public sector and growth in public sector numbers over the years.  We have also seen the use of stamp duty revenues and capital gains tax to promote and increase public sector numbers.  Many of our public servants do great work, which I acknowledge, but we have seen many quangos and small committees in every area and in every Department that have taken from the public purse.  Before the election Fine Gael gave a commitment that we would merge, reform and reduce quangos, and it is good to see in this public service reform report that the programme for Government's commitment to reforming the public sector is taking hold this year in the merger and abolition of a certain number of quangos.In our manifesto we also discussed reductions in the numbers within the public service of up to 30,000, with the programme for Government settling on a figure of 25,000.  Many of these will come from not replacing those people who retire, although there is a view to protecting front-line staff.  I agree with Deputy Fleming that we have seen a new energy with Fianna Fáil in opposition, both in my constituency and the other constituencies which it represents.  The new energy looks to argue what we should do without taking responsibility for what the party did while in government.  I agree that the moratorium on recruitment of nurses and other front-line staff in hospitals must be examined.  Unfortunately, there is a case in St. Francis's nursing home in Galway that we would prefer to have sorted out but a decision of the previous Government is coming home to bite with a possible closure.  Such closures may be seen all over the country, unfortunately, as a legacy of the last Government.We have seen much money spent on planning major bypasses and transport projects around the country.  Although this has created a certain amount of employment, many people do not see those projects going anywhere.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, made a tough decision to suspend the planning on such projects when there was no realistic expectation that we can conclude and complete them.  That was the right move.  There is no point in trying to fool people by saying we will do this, that or the other, continuing to plan those projects without having the relevant finances available when the planning process finishes in 18, 24 or 36 months.There has also been a suspension of interest from international companies in public private partnerships, PPPs, and there has been none for the past two years.  That shows recognition of the reluctance of international companies to invest in the State because of the dire economic circumstances.  Firms wondered if they would get money back, which was the whole point of investing in the State.  The Minister's plan is about dipping our toe into the water with PPP projects, and he has indicated that a number of smaller projects will test the level of interest from international companies for investing in the State.We have seen a more positive view of the country over the past eight months since the new Government, with a strong mandate, has taken over.  That can be compared with where we were this time last year, when there were questions about when the Government would collapse.  We have come a long way and the view of international markets and companies of our country is more positive.  It is important to consider what the reaction will be when we seek public private partnership companies to invest in various projects.I will be slightly parochial with regard to a number of projects which have at least been mentioned within the reform proposals in transport, including the Galway city outer bypass.  It is significant and a large project but by seeing how we get on within the smaller projects within PPPs, we can better judge how to progress the Galway city outer bypass.  This large project would require considerable investment by outside companies and I am confident we will make progress on this vital project.  It has the best cost-benefit analysis result of any road project in the country and it is imperative that in the coming years we make progress towards commencement and construction of the project.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I am glad to be able to speak today on the capital programme for the next few years.  As a civil engineer I realise the importance of investment in our nation's infrastructure.  There is no doubt that the nation's capital investment has been very successful in developing infrastructure over the past 20 years and in County Meath, there are now four motorways, with each making it easier for jobs to come to the area and for businesses and people to operate.  We have reached the stage where there are very few shortfalls and gaps in our road network.  With any remaining gaps there is an issue of providing bypasses while ensuring the current road network is well maintained.  That is in preference to the construction of new motorways.We must learn lessons from the motorway construction programme, particularly how effective was the spend and if the capital costs were in some cases excessive.  For the next four years we have managed to find €17 billion for capital budgets and next year will see us spend approximately €4 billion.  That is a reduction of €750 million but it is still a large amount.  Deputy Fleming spoke of us raiding funds, which is totally unacceptable, particularly since the Deputy and his party raided each and every citizen of the country and put children into hock for generations.  I do not accept such terminology.  He spoke about the lack of job creation in the €17 billion capital programme but I remind him that when his party left government we had 440,000 people on the unemployment register.  We are trying to get out of that mire by creating jobs and this capital investment programme will go a long way in doing so.We must get the best value for money from this expenditure and we must target the expenditure on those projects which will give us the best return for our money.  I have designed and overseen the construction of many road projects and I want to see more bypasses built.  This is for a number of reasons.  They reduce travel times for motorists and make it easier for businesses.  They relieve clogged towns and villages and make it more attractive for people to visit and live in such places.  They also reduce the number of accidents in towns and villages and create jobs in the construction phase.Schemes like the bypass of Slane on the N2 will achieve all these objectives.  I am glad the Minister has ensured there will be sufficient funding in the budget to proceed with the purchase of land for this bypass and in the next few years I will push him to release more money for construction.  Every euro spent on a bypass such as that at Slane will give €3 back to society through social and economic benefits.I mentioned that prior to entering politics I worked in the transport sector.  One of my roles was as investment appraisal manager for new transport projects for British Rail.  While there, I was responsible for carrying out a cost-benefit analysis for a new underground line in London known as Crossrail.  I learned much about the various benefits that could be delivered by new metro systems.  From examining the published documentation on metro north in Dublin I remain unconvinced as to whether the current proposal represents the most effective use of public money.  Taking into account social benefits, time savings, road decongestion, accident savings, job creation, climate change benefits and all other items included in a standard appraisal, it appears that the project even then just about washes its face.We are in a time when other projects may give a greater return for public investment.  As we must be very selective about investment as funding is limited, it is only right that we think again about metro north.  We must ask if a slimmer version would be better and if a more intensive quality bus network would be a better option.  As funding is limited, we should use it wisely.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  The report on infrastructural and capital investment is a wasted opportunity to invest in the green economy, jobs and sustainability.  Next year's capital budget has been cut by €755 million to €3.9 billion.  This report locks the State into economic stagnation and increased unemployment, and it will result in the loss of 7,500 jobs, which is significant.The Government, like its predecessor, is choosing to ignore the role capital spending plays in the economic recovery process.  There can be no recovery without job creation; suggestions to the contrary are fantasy.  Sinn Féin has a different vision and the party's pre-budget submission, entitled Route to Recovery, outlines a comprehensive investment package for the next three years that maintains current capital commitments funded by the Exchequer and additional investment streams.  This investment package includes the development of the green economy and, in particular, alternative energy.One of the biggest omissions in the Government's report is the lack of commitment to alternative energy.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of oil consumption in the world.  Investment in wave and wind power and other alternative sources of energy must be a priority.  The planned removal of the energy efficiency grants is lazy and ill thought out.  At a time when 1.4 million homes are in need of retrofitting the Government should redouble its efforts to encourage insulation and upgrading.  In removing these grants the Government has not dealt with the disadvantages of expecting utility companies to loan the money to householders.  There are currently 200,000 homes in negative equity and, therefore, they may be considered a credit risk.Sustainable Energy Ireland reported that every euro spent on the better energy homes scheme delivers a net benefit of €5 to society, through savings on energy, CO2 and other pollutants.  The Sustainable Energy Ireland analysis shows that investment in home energy upgrades will be fully repaid through energy savings within eight years.  Yet the Government is committed to phasing out those important grants that have been useful.From the point of view of health service users — I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, picks up on the point — the capital programme is undermined by the savage cuts to current spending that continue to be imposed.  For example, the HSE appears to be retreating from care of the elderly, as shown by the closure of nursing homes in my constituency such as Shane in Portlaoise, in Abbeyleix and also in Dublin and Athlone.  The health capital spend for the next four years amounts to more than €1 billion less than the annual cost to the State of the Anglo Irish Bank debt.  We had a fruitful meeting yesterday with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, on Abbeyleix.  I appeal to him to actively examine the provision of the €1.2 billion investment that is required in Abbeyleix.  I also appeal to him to partially lift the moratorium on the recruitment of nursing staff.  We have provided for that in our budget proposals.  One cannot make such calls unless one says how a plan is to be funded.  We recognise that there is a shortage of money but we have set out in our budget proposals how to introduce a limited lifting of the moratorium on the recruitment of front line staff in limited cases.The Government is committed to introducing water charges, yet the State's water distribution network is antiquated.  Decades of under-investment means that in some local authority areas more than half the water is leaking away.  Capital investment in water is being cut from approximately €435 million in 2011 to €331 million in 2012.  That is a cut of €100 million or more than 25%.  It is a cut of nearly €200 million on the 2010 allocation, with more cuts planned until the budget is just €266 million.  Unfortunately for the public, there is a commitment to water rates.  Today's plan commits the Government to "deliver high quality competitively priced water services to customers."  It is not the householder, but the water distribution network, that is the biggest culprit when it comes to leaks.  We all know the system is leaking in towns and cities but the Government is announcing a series of cuts which mean that the network will not be updated.Sinn Féin firmly believes that housing is a right.  The "Prime Time" television programme earlier this week highlighted that the number of homeless people is on the increase.  Sleeping bags are being handed out to the homeless because the hostels cannot cope.  People cannot get a bed or find a hostel for a night.  Those who languish on local authority housing lists will get little comfort from the report given the proposed cut to the housing programme of €150 million.  That will only increase expenditure by the HSE on rent allowance but also the spend by local authorities on social leasing and the rental assistance scheme where we continue to subsidise tens of thousands of private landlords, many renting homes that are not up to standard and that are not registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Once again, this is a missed opportunity to provide a long-term solution to the State's housing crisis.  The plan gives a vague commitment to prioritising the regeneration of Limerick but offers no details and mentions no other regeneration project.  This is particularly frustrating for families in Dublin in areas where they have been waiting years for regeneration projects to commence.The slash and burn politics of the Government is highlighted in the massive cut in spending on the environmental infrastructure.  This is a time when the Government should invest in our green industry to boost the economy and provide jobs.  The capital budget to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been cut by €287 million.  That includes cuts in investment for water services by €65 million and in the rural water programme by €10 million.  There is no commitment to investing in water harvesting which aims to re-use rain water and little commitment to fixing existing leaks in the system.  This investment would not only create badly needed jobs but would reduce water consumption by a third.The massive cuts to capital and infrastructural spending clearly shows the Government has no interest in growth, sustainability or developing a green economy.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I will use the time available to highlight a missed opportunity in the capital programme.  Far more could have been done in capital investment projects at this time.  The decision not to do so has been a mistake.According to the European Commission investment in this country has fallen 74% since 2007 with the EU average being at only 11%.  This crisis in investment coupled with a continued fall in domestic demand represents a significant element within the economic crisis facing the country, which is not replicated among other European counterparts.  The opportunity to invest in worthwhile capital projects represents a part of the economic alternative that is open to this country.  I specifically refer to the metro project on which I disagree with my colleague, Deputy Hannigan.  The metro was scheduled to run through my constituency.  Postponing investment in public transport simply pushes up costs in the long term and reduces prospects for economic growth.  The building of metro north, which was scheduled to run from the city centre as far as Swords, would have been not only of societal benefit and a key resource for the local community but it would also have provided part of the economic stimulus this country requires.One might ask how we would source such an investment.  First, we could begin by broadening our tax base and increasing taxes on capital and wealth in this country which are well below the average tax take in other European countries.  Unlike Fianna Fáil, which suggested that the National Pensions Reserve Fund was being raided, I believe it should be used in a constructive way in the next four years to promote capital investment and job creation.  The only time Fianna Fáil used the fund was to pay off banks.We also require immediate renegotiation of the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes which would generate significant savings for ordinary people.  The publication of a timeline for the metro project is essential.  As far as I am concerned, while it may have been deferred; the metro is something that remains worthwhile and must be on the agenda.I have inquired of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, about the work that will now be done to find the €1 billion which would have been sourced through private investment and whether the €500 million promised by the European Investment Bank as funding for the project will still remain in place?  What is the justification for the €200 million already spent on the planning process?  That will have gone into a black hole if the project is not pursued.  The deployment of €1.2 billion over the next four years from the NPRF into investment projects would yield significant return.  Metro north is a suitable candidate for such investment and I believe it should be done.Despite investment in infrastructure in previous years, particularly in the road network, we still rank below OECD averages on the infrastructural issues facing the country.  Ireland's distribution infrastructure is perceived to be poor.  While Ireland scores high on air and water transport and improvements have been made in recent years, the quality of our energy infrastructure remains weak.  In that context, I agree with other Deputies who have argued that we need to invest in measures such as retrofitting and rain water harvesting now and not row back on them.A modern service provider and modern economy requires a world class telecommunications infrastructure which is vital to the country's ability to do business.  Within the OECD Ireland ranks 22nd out of 30 countries in upgrading local broadband infrastructure.  We need to invest in such infrastructure to promote economic development and ensure we will have a world class telecommunications network.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has committed to this.In a matter of weeks the budget will be announced in the House.  Spending cuts across the board will be proposed.  The reason for the economic crisis in the public finances is the disastrous policies pursued by the previous Government in guaranteeing and socialising private bank debt, as well as the disastrous taxation policies with property based tax loopholes and the reliance on property based taxes.  The crisis cannot be viewed in isolation from the wider economic and social issues facing the country such as unemployment and the infrastructural deficit.  The way to tackle the economic challenges is through growth, investment and job creation.  This will require capital spending and further debate about how we invest in the capital programme int the next few years.  Mistakes were made in not pursuing the metro north project.  I hope that decision will be re-examined and that we will grasp opportunities in the years ahead.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I agree with Deputy Patrick Nulty.  The cut in the capital infrastructure programme represents a gross missed opportunity.  However, the Deputy has a neck to make these points, as he is a member of a party which is in government and responsible for the axing of the metro north project, among others.  If he was serious, he would make a stand like Deputies Naughten and Penrose and vote against the Government in the upcoming budget.  His constituency colleagues told us before the general election that they would support the metro north project, but the Ministers, Deputies Leo Varadkar, Joan Burton and James Reilly, now have nothing to say about it.  This is an insult to the people of Deputy Patrick Nulty's constituency, but more than this it will have a detrimental impact on jobs in the area.  This is a shovel-ready project that could immediately employ 600 people and would open up the north side of Dublin for economic development.  It is a magnificent project which would transform the lives of citizens in the area.  Given that it would cost the Government only €700 million in the course of the next couple of years, it is lunacy to shelve it.  I appeal, even at the eleventh hour, to have the project be re-inserted in the capital budget.Last week the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform tried to say this debate was about choices and that we either had to cut deeper into current expenditure on education, health services and so on, or cut the capital budget.  He said he had chosen to cut the capital budget and was putting these projects on hold because the country could not afford them.  That is utter nonsense.  Choices must be made, but these are not the only ones.  The biggest rise in Government expenditure between 2008 and 2010 was on servicing the debt, much of which had been accumulated by private individuals.  The cost of servicing the debt went from €2 billion to €4.9 billion.There can be no economic recovery until people are put back to work.  Therefore, we cannot afford to cut the capital infrastructure budget.  The private sector is not investing money.  There is a strike of capital and we need the lead to be taken from the Government benches.  There is no other way.The Minister made the point that there was no money available for capital expenditure.  Our answer is that he should go and get it.  He should get it from the wealthy in the form of a personal assets tax.  Some 46.8% of net wealth is held by 5% of the citizens of Ireland.  It is not unreasonable to ask the people concerned to pay a levy in this regard.  There are many ways of increasing taxes on higher earners.  There are numerous ways of getting the money if the Government really wanted to do so.  Clearly, that is not a choice it is willing to make.  It wants to protect the wealthy to the detriment of job creation.  That is just not good enough.There are many projects which were costed, developed and targeted during the boom and which now need to be reconsidered.  The Minister said they had nothing to do with him, but that is not an acceptable answer.  A major sewage treatment plant is planned for north County Dublin as a result of the greater Dublin strategic drainage study.  That project will ultimately cost €2.5 billion and no one in the area wants it to go ahead.  The Government could save money by going back to the drawing board and looking at the alternative of providing smaller, more regionally based local plants which could be phased in over time.  Given that the pinch point is not until 2020, there is no need to go bald-headed after this project.  We pose this suggestion as an alternative.  The Government could save money on the project and transfer it to the metro north project.  All communities and businesses in north County Dublin would be very appreciative of that measure.Some €30 million has been expended on land acquisition for the Nevitt landfill project which is at a halt, but families in the area have the death sentence of compulsory purchase orders hanging over their homes and do not know what is happening.  However, we know that the project will not proceed.  The Government should come clean, get rid of it and save the money allocated.It is clear that the Government plans to charge for water supplies and, ultimately, privatise water services.  The installation of water meters represents a shocking waste of money which should be used to reinvigorate the network.In every local authority area an audit should be undertaken of the decisions made during the boom, to re-examine all the decisions made in these changed times and come up with an alternative budget.  We would save a fortune if we were to do so.  It is not good enough to say it is a matter for individual Departments.  The Minister should order them to re-examine projects.  That would free up money to be invested in worthy projects for which communities and workers are clamouring.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Working towards job creation in the immediate future, as well as making serious investments for the long term, would make very good sense in the current economic climate.  Sadly, the Government has continued along the path taken by the previous Government in accepting the austerity package lock, stock and barrel.  This neo-liberal agenda suits the markets.  The notion that we introduce austerity and expect the ordinary citizens of Europe to pick up the tab for failed banking institutions is getting harder to take the more the crisis deepens.It is a pity the Government lacks the courage to do something different which would be regarded as a greater investment in the country and its people and our society.I understand the supply of money is not limitless and that the Government cannot spend everything it wants on infrastructure.  Therefore, I agree with the withdrawal of a number of projects.  For example, we have spent enough mad money on the Thornton Hall project.  While money must be spent to improve prison conditions, we should not expand the number of prisons.  Instead of locking more people away, it would make better sense to invest more in the social aspect of crime prevention and address the root causes of crime.  More than enough people are in prison.  The scrapping of the Thornton Hall project was a good move on the part of the Government.Given the current economic climate, a number of road projects were over the top.  Ten years ago there was a serious deficit in the road structure, but there have been many positive advances since.  That said, we probably got carried away with ourselves and I am not sorry to see some projects being shelved.  For example, the grandiose Wexford and New Ross bypass projects were beyond——

#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I welcome the chance to contribute on this important issue.  The capital programme shows a marked reduction on previous transport allocations.  Much has been delivered in that field in recent years, but we are in a difficult financial position.  While they are not of the Government's making, we must make difficult decisions to address the problems facing us.  It is welcome that 85% of the funding available under the programme will go towards restoring and maintaining existing road and rail infrastructure and replacing buses and trains.Where did the money go?  For years it was not well spent.  To an extent, I agree with Deputy Wallace that some of the money was spent on buying land at exorbitant prices, but who watches the watchers?  In a race to the bottom we tried to pursue the most grandiose projects at the grandest costs, but they provided no value for the taxpayer or the country.Whenever I drive to Dublin and use the eFlow system, I spend €2.70 on the M4 and might drive onto the M50.  After examining my bills at one point, I reckoned that I was spending approximately €1,000 a year.  It is another tax.  Many drivers use the Enfield-Kilcock road because they are not prepared to pay €2.70 each way.  For trucks, the charge is €6 or €7.  We need to get real.  The companies which are making a great deal of money should bring their costs down.  Otherwise, people will take to side roads and projects will not be used as much as was intended.The port tunnel nearly cost €1 billion to build.  I have argued long and hard to have the cost for cars using the tunnel to be reduced.  It is good that the charge has fallen to €3, but I cannot understand why taxis are charged for using the tunnel.  If I take a taxi from Dublin Airport to the city centre, if I do not use the tunnel, the journey takes 15 or 20 minutes longer and costs €25 or €26.  If I ask the taxi driver to use the tunnel and pay the €3 charge, I will get into the city ten or 15 minutes sooner and save €6 or €7.  Taxis should not be charged for using the tunnel, as doing so is anti the tourism industry and is a poor use of the infrastructure in which we invested so much money.In terms of road maintenance, it is welcome that the Ballaghaderreen bypass, a shovel-ready project, has received the go-ahead.  It will create employment in counties Roscommon and Mayo.  It is nice that common sense has been used to approve this necessary project.The work on the A5 with the Northern Ireland Executive presents a difficulty.  We are in a restrictive position, but we made commitments and, if one is coming from County Donegal and the island is viewed as a whole, the project makes sense.  Some believe we should not spend the money, but we must live up to our commitments under the Good Friday Agreement.  This gesture of goodwill will also represent value for money, as the country needs national infrastructure.The Galway city bypass project needs to move beyond legal delays.  The situation is crazy.  In the middle of July I travelled two or three miles in an hour and a half.  People elsewhere do not fully realise how bad the traffic is in Galway.  The issue needs to be addressed.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware of the position, but I did not realise how bad it was until I was sitting in traffic.  The project needs to be advanced.On smarter travel initiatives, the investment in key cycling and walking infrastructure is welcome.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal is well used, while the old railway line from Newport in County Mayo is being used by cyclists everyday.  We must consider in greater detail how we can link towns and villages along railway lines, canals and rivers using cycling infrastructure.  Cycle paths in Holland and Germany are not used by other vehicles.  A similar initiative here would help tourism.  The existing commitments regarding tourism will be fully honoured, which I welcome.  The reduction in VAT and airport tax stimulated the tourism economy.  That creates jobs because people spend money when they come into the country.  We must try to get people around the country and we have much to offer.  The new Ryanair route to Knock Airport will get people to the west.  Tourism needs to be spread around the country.  When one walks around Temple Bar tonight or tomorrow night, it is evident what the tourism dividend means to this country.  Unfortunately, many native people do not seem to apply for jobs in cafés, restaurants and pubs.  The jobs pay the minimum wage but there are many opportunities out there.  I walk by restaurants and I see signs for waitresses or publicans wanted; there are opportunities.Connecting the two Luas lines makes very good sense.  Going up towards Broombridge, which I know from the Sligo line, there is an area without many houses, which is linked to an industrial area.  There are opportunities for those areas.We have talked about metro north and we would love to see these projects built.  We have not used the port tunnel to its maximum value.  One can get on a bus at Connolly Station or Busáras and be at the airport in five or ten minutes by using the port tunnel.  It is a bit like the Bertie bowl.  Croke Park stadium is fantastic, as is the IRFU stadium.  I shudder to think what would have happened if we had spent €1 billion on the Bertie bowl because it would not have been filled.  Other Deputies have outlined how, when the reigning world champions South Africa were in town a few months ago, the stadium was half full.  People cannot afford to attend.  I am delighted that the Bertie bowl was not continued.Infrastructure is vital and I pay tribute to Irish Rail for upgrading its fleet and competing.  On the Sligo line, people are voting with their feet and taking the train.  The cost of trains is exorbitant.  I note that there are safety issues but they need to come up with more innovative ways to get people on the train.  If I am in Boyle or Sligo, it would cost €39 or €40 for a return ticket to Dublin.  If I drive to Longford, which is in the commuter belt, I can get the train for €10.  This is what puts people off.  Many people are using the train services but they drive to an area where they can get the train at a cheaper price when travelling to Dublin.  We will not have a satisfactory public transport system if the cost of driving a car is less than taking public transport.  Infrastructure provides jobs and a competitive economy and I welcome these measures.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I wish to take up one of the points mentioned by Deputy Frank Feighan regarding the proposed development of the A5 north of the Border.  It is an important project for the island and is very important for Donegal.  My Dáil colleague, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, my Seanad colleague, Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill, and the MEP for the North-West, Pat the Cope Gallagher, have been vocal in their support for this project.  If one is in business in Donegal and trying to bring product to the ports or airport in Dublin, it is essential to have a good arterial route to the capital.  I ask the Government to review the decision.  The project was identified after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  It is not only beneficial to counties Tyrone and Derry but also to my constituency, particularly County Monaghan, and Donegal.  Crossing the Border at Aughnacloy on the Monaghan-Tyrone border, the road deteriorates very quickly.  The route is not adequate for the volume of traffic travelling from Derry and towns along the route.Previously, when debates took place, officials from Departments attended.  The current practice seems to be a new departure.  A few weeks ago, we had a debate on social welfare and a number of Deputies from all sides of the House raised matters.  I noticed that there was no official taking notes.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot always be present for debates.  That day, the Minister for Social Protection was not present for that part of the debate.  I am sure she had other commitments but there was no official from her Department present.  In the past, officials from the Department would take notes and, if queries were raised by Deputies on any side of the House requiring clarification, the relevant Minister or Department would revert to that Deputy.I refer to an issue exercising the minds of the people and the local authority in Monaghan regarding a decision by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to withdraw funding due to be allocated by the National Roads Authority to Monaghan County Council to complete a project between Monaghan town and Emyvale.  Part of the work has been completed satisfactorily and all preparatory work to complete the remainder of the project has been undertaken.  This is a matter of road safety concerning the removal of dangerous bends on a national primary route that is not up to standard.  I ask the Minister to review the decision, which concerns relatively small amounts of money given the capital budget for the Minister's Department.  The Mayor of County Monaghan, Councillor Seamus Coyle, and Councillor Robbie Gallagher spoke to me in recent days about this issue.  They are anxious that the decision is reviewed.Speaking about the province of Ulster and not just the three southern counties, I am appalled at the proposal to increase VAT by 2% in the forthcoming budget.  That will lead to significant job losses in Border communities.  I appeal to the Government, through the Minister of State, to think twice before loading another 2% VAT on consumers this winter.  Whether this happens immediately after the budget or on 1 January, it will be devastating and will do enormous damage to the economy of the Border counties.  I am concerned about the economy of Cavan and Monaghan and areas south of the Border counties.  Already we see businesses north of the Border capitalising on reports that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are set to increase VAT by 2% in the forthcoming budget.  We see advertisements encouraging shoppers to travel across the Border for a better price.  For small businesses across my constituency and further afield that are already struggling, such a significant hike will be disastrous as they head into the difficult winter months.  The Government should be encouraging consumers to support their local economy rather than incentivising them to flock across the Border for what might be termed better value.  Before and after the election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party claimed that job creation would be their top priority in office but their actions since coming into power show quite clearly that this is not the case.  By frontloading VAT increases, pushing the cost of sick pay onto employers and cutting the rebate to employers on redundancies, this Government will stifle businesses and hamper entrepreneurship.  That is the last thing we want to happen at a time when the economy is facing major challenges.  Every household is also facing major challenges.  There is still time for the Government to see sense and not accept the proposal from the Minister for Finance to frontload a VAT hike.  I appeal to the Minister of State and Government Deputies to review this proposal.  It was proposed in the four year plan published a year ago.  If VAT was to be increased under that plan, it was to be increased by 1% and 2013 and 1% in 2014.  The idea of frontloading it in the budget in two weeks' time is ridiculous and will do enormous damage.I have represented Cavan-Monaghan in the Dáil since 1992.  Far too often, we have seen business literally ebb away from our towns.  Those towns during the years of economic progress saw new shops and centres developed and they all provide top class value and great choice for the consumer.  Such an increase in VAT will do enormous damage and we sincerely hope that will not happen.The Minister for Education and Skills has rightly outlined that he faces formidable challenges in providing accommodation for all the new entrants into the school system.  The welcome growth in our population places particular demands on ensuring the Department has primary school and secondary school places available.  We have seen a huge transformation in the education infrastructure of the country in the past decade, with the provision of new facilities and the upgrading of existing facilities at primary, post-primary and third level.  There is always a need to continue the refurbishment programme and the provision of new facilities.  The Minister, however, has indicated that there will not be funding for the summer works scheme or the emergency building works scheme.  At Question Time a week ago, I appealed to the Minister to review that decision, with his Government colleagues.  All of us have seen exceptionally good value for money where schools have drawn down money under those schemes and have been transformed as a result of small grants.  The taxpayer has got the best return on those investments and I appeal to the Minister to reinstate those programmes in the next few years.We have all seen the expansion and upgrading of facilities at third level.  In June, the Department of Education and Skills showed the demand for higher education is set to grow by 62% in the next 20 years.  That will be a welcome development.  In the last ten years, the participation at third level has increased by 60%, growing from 100,000 to 159,000.  We have seen people from homes with limited income getting the opportunity to go on to third level.  In 2009, we reached the situation in the European Union of the highest tertiary level attainment rate among 25 to 34 year olds.  That is great evidence of the success of the programme of investment in the facilities and the human capital.It is vital at a time of challenging economic circumstances that we prioritise education expenditure.  Other countries that face formidable economic circumstances in the past all prioritised Government expenditure.  The first debate in this Dáil was a Private Members' motion I tabled on behalf of Fianna Fáil in April and we won unanimous support from all sides that the Government would prioritise education for expenditure despite the challenging economic and fiscal circumstances.  I call on the Government to do that on the revenue side and the capital side.  We can be satisfied with the progress that has been made but more progress is necessary.  Investment is needed in our schools at primary and secondary level and at third level.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I realise the difficulties the Government is facing.  It has been left in a difficult situation where cuts are essential but investment in infrastructure is also essential.  It is in an unenviable position.  It has made plain where cuts must be made and to some extent that is the easy part.  In theory, it is easy to draw a line through the metro project, Thornton Hall prison and other plans.  There might be local difficulties but it must be done.The difficult part is the investment.  In that area, the Government has shown it does not have a great deal of scope or imagination and does not hold out much hope.  I take the point that the report emphasised the potential of public private partnerships but it is only potential and I do not see an enormous degree of optimism that it will be able to raise money in that sphere.  Private money requires profit; it does not look for any social or community benefit.  There are very few investors who want to invest in Ireland at the moment; that is the reality.  There are very few who want to invest in Europe, as we saw from the German bond auction yesterday.  The lack of hope and optimism in that area in this report and in the Minister's speech is ominous.I note with alarm the rather desperate way the report looks towards pensions.  There was a time when the National Pensions Reserve Fund was looked upon as a source for investment in infrastructure in the areas we have now cut as a result of Government policy.  Those coffers are now empty and in this report once again the pensions industry and the pensions pot is being looked at as a way to rescue the Government.  The report says it will make offers to pension funds to invest in the infrastructure it cannot fund itself.  That is a desperate situation that is based on the alarming realisation that the money will not come from anywhere else.  The State is out of money and so the pension funds are being eyed in exactly the same way as when the State applied the 0.6% levy.It is a dangerous precedent to look at pension funds as a source of funds for State projects.  We are not going down the road of confiscation but we are going down the road of pressure.  If we start to pressurise pension funds to put money into projects that are for the benefit of communities, they are being asked to deny their commercial mandate.  Once they do that, they are betraying the pensioners who put money into them.  It is a difficult conflict to resolve but it is very dangerous for those pensioners if the pension funds go into non-commercial, Government directed projects for the good of the community.  The community must be looked after but it is wrong to look after them from private pension funds if they are put under non-commercial pressure to do it.The other area where investment is most important is multinationals.  It is indicative and depressing that the report mentions education and health as priorities but it admits that there will be cuts in third level education because there is not enough money to fund all educational requirements.  What does that mean?  Multinationals, I suspect, will look upon us with a more jaundiced view than in the past.  They will look at the education infrastructure and say we are not educating our people for the jobs they have created here.  There was evidence of this recently when the American Chamber of Commerce came out and revealed there were at least 2,000 unfilled jobs because the education had not been provided at third level to train people for those posts.Broadband is another area that must be examined if multinationals are to continue coming here.  If the word goes out, and we have been lucky so far that it is not more widespread, that broadband in this country is not up to scratch, the multinationals will look elsewhere.An alarming phrase in the report pertains to the setting up of a next generation broadband task force.  Using the weasel words used when one is not going to fulfil one's requirements, the report states the purpose of the task force is to discuss the optimal policy environment required to facilitate the provision of high speed broadband across the country.  This means a task force has been set up to solve a problem it cannot solve.  It is considering projects that will not be developed in the timescale in question.  This is an amber light, a danger signal that there is no commitment to broadband provision.  There was no such commitment by the previous Government.  I brought forward two Private Members' Bills on the matter.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	373	As a matter of courtesy, the Deputy should allow Deputy Fleming to contribute.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	374	Road projects which are advanced regarding planning and land acquisition and which are shovel-ready will have to be prioritised.  They are vital to completing the jigsaw required to enable our economy to rise from its currently depressed state.  Apart from jobs related to the transport and communications aspects, jobs generated in the construction of road network projects were never more wanted.  I ask the Cabinet to reconsider and re-evaluate the investment programme.In Kerry, the Killarney-Farranfore primary route project has been shelved.  The corridor for the new road has been mapped and negotiations with landowners have practically been finalised.  There has been considerable expenditure of public money on these exercises.  Kerry has the most successful regional airport in the country, namely, Kerry Airport in Farranfore.  Kerry is the home of the Irish tourism product.  The road in question is essential to enable Kerry to get back on its feet and exploit its great potential.  Access to the county and within the county is very badly needed.  Access routes would make the county more attractive to potential investors, including those interested in foreign direct investment.  At present, Kerry is at a huge disadvantage in this regard.  The main approach from Cork, through Macroom, to the Kerry county boundary, is very seriously deficient.  This is a major drawback for the economy of the south west and it militates against the economic development of County Kerry.  I urge the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to make progress on this vital artery, keep it on the programme and expedite the new road construction project.With regard to the Dublin side and the west, the Adare-Abbeyfeale approach has sections that need to be completed.  These sections are relatively short and it is not beyond the means of the Exchequer to complete them.  The approval of these road projects would give a much-needed stimulus at construction stage and would generate activity that would create thousands of jobs.I commend the National Roads Authority on its national road developments, over the past ten years in particular.  Journey times have reduced drastically, which is of considerable benefit to the domestic and commercial commuter.  Public private partnerships have been successful, and the access roads to Kerry should be considered seriously for completion under such partnerships.I welcome the statement on next-generation broadband and its inclusion as a priority.  I hope its roll-out will be country-wide and proceed at an early date.  Two private projects, in Dublin and Wexford, are already up and running.  Recently, by means of a priority question, I urged the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, to extend private projects to take in Kerry because it is the hub of tourism.  It attracts a considerable number of visitors every year.  There are some black spots in the county and we need to increase broadband speed and bandwidth.Currently Kerry's infrastructure in this area is far inferior to what is required for businesses.  Consider the requirements for large events and conferences, for instance.  The infrastructural inferiority was illustrated twice over the past two years during the Irish Open.  Only for the on-the-ground expertise of our technicians, the foreign media would have been inconvenienced seriously when reporting this major event.I welcome many of the developments with regard to the National Children's Hospital and I urge the Government to give priority to education and the creation of jobs.  I commend the Government on what it has done for the tourism product this year, for instance.With regard to agriculture, the report gives a figure of 170,000 workers, but we were told by the IFA today that 300,000 are engaged in the agriculture and food industry.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I welcome this debate.  The claim by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on 16 November that creating jobs would be made a top priority of the Government simply does not stand up against the facts.  On what is the idea that the IDA is on target to create 105,000 new jobs, with 640 investments, based?  In effect, there is an investment strike by the private sector.  Since 2009, non-financial corporations in Ireland have made over €30 billion in profit.  They are not investing this.  Despite falling wages and rising profits, they are sitting on these funds.  The State must take the lead with an emergency jobs programme to meet the needs of the 450,000 who are employed.  Instead of doing this, the Government's approach to the capital programme is to make cuts.  Projects that would create jobs, such as metro north, have been axed.The commitment of €1.6 billion towards water infrastructure is pathetic.  It would cost more just to deal with leaking water mains and the completely inadequate Victorian sewerage system in Dublin city alone.  Next Monday, Dublin City Council will be presented with a capital expenditure estimate of €356.9 million in respect of water and sewerage systems for the period 2012-14.  This sum is paltry; it is a drop in the ocean.  Expenditure will depend on whether the council gets the money from the Government.  The figure is an estimate and could be much lower.  The money must be used for flood relief, water treatment in Ringsend, the new reservoir in Saggart and the fixing of broken water pipes.There is a need for a programme of emergency works to renew water mains and drains.  It is an absolute scandal that drains in Dublin city are so old that they keep backing up.  Around the corner from me, on O'Donoghue Street, residents have been contacting the council continually over problems associated with the back-up of water every time there is a flood.  Only three or four weeks ago, they had three or four feet of water in their homes owing to the heavy floods.  This is outrageous.  The problem is systemic in my area and I am sure it features all over the city.There is a need for a programme of emergency sewerage works in both urban and rural areas.  There is a need for rainwater harvesting systems, as have been mentioned, flood prevention, road repairs, insulation of public buildings and the conversion of used public buildings into public facilities.I have not really heard the question of regeneration mentioned today.  People are condemned to live in unfit properties.  Residents in Dolphin House live in conditions such that they are facing a denial of their human rights.  Residents and council tenants in St. Michael's Estate and O'Devaney Gardens have all been let down by previous Governments, and public private partnerships condemn them to live, over the coming years, in abject housing conditions.  There is no funding for completing these projects.The United Left Alliance prepared a budget proposal that it believes would immediately create 100,000 jobs through direct employment on foot of dealing with the issues I have mentioned, at a cost of approximately €5 billion per year.  This proposal has been costed and the money could be raised through wealth taxes, including an asset wealth tax.Mass unemployment and emigration now comprise a structural feature of our economy and society and will remain such unless the Government breaks with its failed policy of austerity, which has destroyed domestic demand.  The State must play a key role in the creation of jobs.  I do not know if I am abusing my time.  This morning I heard that a Nigerian taxi driver died after being violently attacked last Monday.  I condemn that attack and send my sincere condolences to his family.  I think my sentiments will be echoed by every Member of this House.  This was a racist attack and we cannot accept the killing of a man while he is doing his job.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I concur with the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker regarding a horrific murder.  Nobody carrying out his or her lawful work should be subjected to such attacks.  It is a tragedy.I welcome the publication of the Government's capital expenditure programme but I am disappointed about what it contains.  When I sat on the benches opposite I had to listen to the current Chief Whip, Deputy Kehoe, and his colleagues as they demanded more and more.  He interrupted Deputy Wallace today to speak about projects in New Ross.  We all have projects in our own areas.  The cuts in capital spending in education and agriculture alone will do enormous long-term damage to this country.I met a delegation from the IFA earlier today.  Agricultural exports have increased from €7 billion three years ago to almost €9 billion today.  The cuts proposed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, will set the sector back at least ten years.  Farmers helped us out our last two recessions and they can help us again this time.  They are willing to take small cuts but they will not tolerate a slash and burn approach to grant schemes.The Government is blaming its predecessor for the mess in which it found itself but it is hoping that it can continue to cut for the next two years and still be seen as the good guy in three years' time.  That is a false hope.  I lived through the same attitude among Ministers in the last Government.  The people cannot take any more.  Ordinary people cannot live with these cuts.  It does not appear to bother the Government that it is breaking every promise it ever made.I can understand the reason for scrapping certain major infrastructural projects given the costs involved but smaller projects could still proceed.  In County Tipperary, we accept we will not get an upgrade of the N24 to motorway status between Pallasgreen and Carrick-on-Suir but Tipperary town is jammed with traffic and needs a 3 km bypass.  The bypass that was constructed around Cashel 12 years ago became part of the N8.  That was a case of forward thinking.  We can achieve unprecedented value for money because 450,000 unemployed people are ready, able and willing to do the work and the projects are ready for tender.  If we do not reconsider the cuts to smaller projects we will close down the country.Across County Tipperary, from Tipperary town to Carrick-on-Suir, the talk is about closures.  Government backbenchers came out of their most recent parliamentary party meeting announcing that 40 hospitals would be closed.  They are scaremongering.  I realise that some of these hospitals will be closed but they should not frighten the daylights out the elderly people who have done so much to build up this country.  If we added up all the cuts the Government has leaked over the past several weeks, it would amount to nearly €3 billion.  The Government wants a soft landing on 7 December but it is stifling investment and frightening people who are entitled to nursing home care and hospital places.  These are people who paid their taxes.  The Government has lost the plot and is spinning like a top.  It has more spin doctors than previous Governments.Even though the rural public transport scheme operates on a paltry budget of €10.8 million, it is a fabulous system.  It depends on voluntary groups such as the Carlow-Kilkenny-South Tipperary Ring a Link, members of which I will meet this evening in Kilkenny.  The Ring a Link is operated by two staff and drivers employed on a community employment scheme.  It offers a wonderful service to people in rural areas.Next week we will be debating a Bill which discriminates against rural dwellers who have bought their sites, received planning permission and built their houses.  They will face penal, if not criminal, taxes.  Inspectors will crawl around back gardens like the peep of day boys to inspect what these people have worked hard to build.  The county councils will impose registration fees even though they should be able to compile a register of every septic tank in their areas from their planning records.  They have planning files stretching back God knows how many years, unless they have been burnt or shredded.  It is further bureaucracy from the Government and the Civil Service.  The people cannot and will not take any more of this.  Why should rural dwellers be penalised to the tune of €10,000 or €15,000 when we have spent hundreds of millions of euro on water and sewerage schemes in our towns?  Why do we have a two-tier system in which rural dwellers are criminalised and required to pay for appeals?  Ratepayers will also have to pay if they want to appeal their rate bills.  As a representative of the people, I do not accept this imposition.

#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Government's capital programme.  Certain aspects of the programme, such as the commitments to primary care, mental health provision and the national children's hospital, have been praised by the media and experts.  However, the programme's commitments mean nothing because they are subject to the availability of financial resources over the coming two or three years.  Within weeks of the report's publication, rumours have started to appear in the media that community hospitals may close and mental health services may not receive the €35 million which is supposedly ring-fenced for next year.Politicians often say that polls are a snapshot in time.  This report is also a snapshot in time because it is already out of date.  It will be subject to significant roll-backs over the coming several years while the Government continues to slash and burn public service programmes.  The reduction of €750 million in next year's capital programme will stifle job creation and remove stimulus from the economy.  Any benefits that would be generated from these construction projects will be lost forever.  The result will be further austerity in next year's budget.  Rolling back on capital investment does not make sense at this time.  This issue has been thrashed out many times in the House and in public discourse.  Capital investment should be maintained if not increased during this period because value for money can be achieved, construction costs are lower and they have a multiplier effect for the economy.  They would boost confidence and, ultimately, increase revenue for the Exchequer.Last week's North-South Ministerial Council meeting was lauded as a success for saving the A5-N2 project.  However, the Government is only committing €50 million to the project in 2015 and 2016, which is no more than it offered to invest prior to the meeting.  The only light coming from the meeting is the Northern Assembly's commitment to match this €50 million.  Instead of a project that will deliver first class infrastructure and access to the north west, we will get €100 million worth of road improvements over the coming five years and a woolly commitment from the Taoiseach that further funding will be made available after 2017.  The commitment to the A5-N2 project was part of an international agreement entered into by this State and its British counterpart.  The Government can roll back on that commitment but there is no movement on other sovereign agreements.  When it comes to the bail out, the Government cannot do anything.  What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  If this sovereign agreement does not mean anything then any other sovereign agreements into which we have entered do not mean very much either.Regarding the upgrading of broadband, the Government's entire focus seems to be on developing wireless communications, which creates major fears within the community regarding the increasing number of masts required to provide all the wireless services.  There is little confidence in local communities that this is acceptable to them.  The recent Forfás report on broadband indicates that there is consensus across Europe that the roll-out of fibre should be the backbone of any state's broadband policy.  Ireland has 13% fibre penetration for broadband access.  Countries such as Latvia and Lithuania, which would be classified on the lower tier in the European Union for Internet access and the knowledge society, are considerably better than we are.  Latvia has 41% access to fibre broadband and Lithuania has 44% access to fibre broadband.  In ten years we will not get anywhere near those figures based on the Government's plans.  As Forfás has pointed out, the capital infrastructure investment programme should commit to rolling out fibre to all towns with a population of more than 1,500 people.  Forfás projects it would cost approximately €2.2 billion, but it would be a worthwhile investment that would pay back in spades to the State by allowing us truly to become part of the knowledge society.  It would allow businesses to access markets and avail of Internet sales.

Tá a lán bainte amach ag an gCoimisinéar Teanga agus ag an bhfoireann atá aige le seacht mbliana go leith anuas.  Tá a lán bainte amach acu chun cearta teanga a chur ar an gclár náisiúnta.  Tá díomá ar a lán daoine roimh ráiteas an Rialtais go gcuirfear Oifig an Choimisinéara isteach le hOifig an Ombudsman.  Tugtar tacaíocht láidir don choimisinéar ag Teachtaí Dála agus ag Seanadóirí.  Nuair a ath-cheapadh an Coimisinéar Teanga tugadh tacaíocht ag gach pháirtí sa Dáil, ag an Taoiseach agus ag an Tánaiste don chinneadh sin.Oifig bheag neamhspleách is ea Oifig an Choimisinéara, agus cúig go leith duine ar an bhfoireann faoi stiúradh an choimisinéara. Tá an oifig ar léas ó Údarás na Gaeltachta agus cíos dá réir á íoc ar ais sa Státchiste.  Ní ceart go ndúnfar an oifig.  Státseirbhísigh ar fad atá ag obair ar fhoireann na hoifige agus tá an coimisinéar féin ceaptha ar chonradh sé bliana, ó Feabhra 2010 go Feabhra 2016.Tá a lán díospóireachta déanta againn faoi Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.  Deirtear i straitéis sin an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge go gcuirfear Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 i bhfeidhm go hiomlán.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh Coimisinéar Teanga againn agus oifig agus dualgais aige chun an straitéis sin a chur i bhfeidhm.Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire Stáit cén fáth go bhfuil na hathraithe seo ag teacht anois.  Cén fáth go bhfuil an Rialtas ag rá go mbeidh an dlúth-cheangal seo idir an coimisinéar agus Oifig an Ombudsman?
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Teachta Micheál Kitt as an deis seo a fháil labhairt leis an dTeach inniu maidir le cinneadh an Rialtais Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga a chónascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman.  Ba mhaith liom a bheith an-soiléir nach bhfuil Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga le dúnadh. Is é an cinneadh atá tógtha ag an Rialtas go ndéanfar feidhmeanna na hoifige sin a chónascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman agus go gcuirfear an cinneadh sin i gcrích i gcomhthéacs an athbhreithnithe ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 atá ar siúl ag mo Roinnse i láthair na huaire.  Go deimhin, tá sé luaite go sonrach sna téarmaí tagartha don athbhreithniú go "mbreithneofar na forálacha a leagann amach ról Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga".Sílim go mbeadh sé cabhrach dá bhféadfainn cinneadh an Rialtais i dtaca leis an gcónascadh seo a chur i gcomhthéacs don Teach.  Rinne an Rialtas seo soiléir ón tús ina chlár Rialtais go raibh sé tiomanta do leasuithe substaintiúla a dhéanamh ar an tseirbhís phoiblí, go háirithe ar an mbealach a dhéantar seirbhísí a sheachadadh don saoránach.  Mar chuid den athbhreithniú cuimsitheach caiteachais atá ar siúl ag an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe faoi láthair, tugadh treoir do na Ranna Rialtais go léir dul trí gach uile líne caiteachais, lena n-áirítear aon chaiteachas ar áisíneachtaí agus ar oifigí éagsúla.  Is mar thoradh ar an bpróiseas sin a rinne an tAire Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe moltaí don Rialtas chun athchóiriú a dhéanamh ar an tseirbhís phoiblí, moltaí ar glacadh leo ag bord an Rialtais.  Tá na cinntí Rialtais seo tógtha mar chuid den athbhreithniú cuimsitheach caiteachais a thionscain an Rialtas agus atá faoi stiúir na Roinne Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe.Is í an phríomhaidhm atá le plean an Rialtais chun athchóiriú a dhéanamh ar an tseirbhís phoiblí ná a chinntiú go mbeidh seirbhís níos trédhearcaí, níos cuntasaí agus níos éifeachtaí ann ar mhaithe le saoránaigh an Stáit.  Ní hamháin chun costais a ghearradh a bhfuil cinntí tógtha ag an Rialtas, athchóiriú a dhéanamh ar an tseirbhís phoiblí.  Creideann an Rialtas go mbeidh buntáistí le baint as líon na gcomhlachtaí poiblí a laghdú, ní hamháin i dtéarmaí laghdú costais ach i dtéarmaí timpeallacht riaracháin níos simplí agus níos éifeachtaí a bheith ann.  Tiocfaidh na buntáistí is suntasaí ón dtimpeallacht riaracháin sin, rud a thabharfaidh cuntasacht dhaonlathach níos fearr, níos lú dúblála agus línte freagrachta níos soiléire maidir le seachadadh seirbhísí don saoránach.Ba mhaith liom a mheabhrú fosta nach é Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga amháin an t-aon oifig ombudsman atá luaite i bplean an Rialtais chun athchóiriú a dhéanamh ar an tseirbhís phoiblí.  Tá cinneadh tógtha ag an Rialtas oifigí éagsúla, a bhfuil feidhmeanna ombudsman acu, a chónascadh ar mhaithe le cur chuige níos éifeachtaí agus níos sruthlínithe a chur i bhfeidhm maidir le seachadadh seirbhísí do shaoránaigh an Stáit.Tá sé soiléir ó phlean an Rialtais go bhfuil Oifig an Choimisinéara Cosanta Sonraí agus Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga le cónascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman, chomh maith leis na feidhmeanna cúloifige a bhaineann le hOifig Ombudsman na Leanaí.  Ó thaobh an tsaoránaigh de, luíonn sé le réasún go mbeidh cur chuige níos éifeachtaí ann mar thoradh ar dhaoine a bheith in ann triall ar Oifig an Ombudsman in ionad iad a bheith ag triall ar oifigí éagsúla Ombudsman.Tá go leor ceisteanna á gcur maidir le cur i bhfeidhm an chónasctha idir Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga agus Oifig an Ombudsman. Ar an gcéad dul síos, teastóidh leasú reachtaíochta chun an cónascadh a chur i bhfeidhm. Cé is moite de leasuithe reachtaíochta, déanfar na mionsonraí maidir leis an gcónascadh a oibriú amach i gcomhthéacs an athbhreithnithe ar an Acht teanga.Maidir leis na himpleachtaí don fhoireann in Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga, is státseirbhísigh iad an fhoireann, cé is moite den gCoimisinéir Teanga féin.  Dá bhrí sin, níl aon chailliúint post i gceist.  Maidir leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga féin, athcheapadh don dara téarma é sa bhliain 2010 agus maireann a théarma go dtí an bhliain 2016.  Beidh mo Roinn ag plé na himpleachtaí a eascraíonn ón gcinneadh seo leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga agus leis an bhfoireann in Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga sa tréimhse amach romhainn.  Aontaím leis an Teachta Kitt go raibh sár obair á dhéanamh ag an gCoimisinéir teanga sna dualgais agus na freagrachtaí a tugadh dó agus is é sin an fáth gur tugadh síneadh ama cúig bhliain eile don oifig anuraidh.  Is cinnte gur vóta muiníne é sin.  Ach mar adúirt mé, is é cuspóir an Rialtais ná na heagraíochtaí uilig a bhíonn ag plé le hábhair mar sin a chónascadh sa dóigh is go mbeidh sábhailt airgid ann nuair a bheidh seo curtha i gcrích, ach ag an am céanna go mbeidh teacht ag an bpobal ar na seirbhísí.  Dúirt an Taoiseach é féin maidir leis an scéal nach mbeadh ísliú ar bith ar éifeacht, fhreagracht ná cur chuige an Choimisinéara teanga, fiú amháin nuair a bheidh an cónascadh seo déanta.

Táim an-bhuíoch don Aire ach ní aontaím leis an méid atá ráite go h-iomlán.  Labhair sé faoi chaiteachas ach ansin dúirt sé nach caiteachas amháin atá i gceist.  Ar ndóigh, aontaíonn an tAire Stáit liom go bhfuil sár-obair á dhéanamh ag an gCoimisinéir teanga agus a fhoireann, ach an bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil coimisinéir teanga ceaptha anois sa Bhreatain Bheag agus gur thóg an tír sin sampla Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga sa tír seo leis an cheapachán sin a dhéanamh.  Aithníonn an Bhreatain Bheag Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga i nGaillimh mar shampla de "best practice" sna gnóthaí seo.  Tá an-mholadh tuillte ag an gcoimisinéir as an moladh sin a fháil ón Bhreatain Bheag.Mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit, ní chaillfidh aon duine atá ag obair san oifig a phost.  Tá an fhoireann ag obair go dian do chearta teanga.  Cinnte, ní bheidh aon airgead le sábháil go dtí 2016, mar tá an coimisinéir athcheaptha go dtí sin.  An cheist atá agam mar sin ná: Cén fáth an bhfuil an tAire Stáit ag caint faoi athruithe nuair atá an coimisinéir agus a fhoireann ag déanamh sár obair agus nuair nach mbeidh aon athrú ann go ceann cúig bhliain eile?  Ba mhaith liom dá ndéanfadh an Roinn athbhreithniú ar an cheist seo ar fad.

Ba mhaith liom a rá arís gurb é an cinneadh atá déanta ag an pointe seo ag an Rialtas ná comhtháthú agus cónascadh a dhéanamh idir Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga agus Oifig an Ombudsman.  Níl aon socrú eile déanta ag an bpointe seo.  Is é an t-aon socrú eile atá déanta, agus bhí sé seo i gclár an Rialtais a d'aontaigh na páirtithe, ná go ndéanfar athbhreithniú ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla atá ag feidhmiú anois ó 2003.  Dúradh freisin go ndéanfar san athbhreithniú sin, athbhreithniú chomh maith ar ról agus ar Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga.  Sin an t-aon socrú atá déanta go dtí seo.D'fhógair mé i gCill Áirne ag an Oireachtas cúpla seachtain ó shin go bhfuil an t-athbhreithniú sin faoi lán seol anois maidir le Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla.  Beidh muid ag súil le aighneachtaí ón phobal agus na heagraíochtaí agus tá mé cinnte go gcuirfidh siad a gcuid tuairimí agus a gcuid barúlacha in iúl agus go mbeidh a gcomhairle le fáil maidir leis an socrú nó cinneadh seo atá déanta ag an Rialtas a chur i bhfeidhm.  Níl muid ach ag tús an scéil anseo.  Tá bóthar fada romhainn agus tá na mion sonraí go léir le socrú.  Déanfar iad sin a shocrú agus déanfar cinneadh ansin i dtuilleamaí an comhairlí agus an phróisis athbhreithnithe athchóirithe.Déarfaidh mé arís, ní hé Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga an t-aon oifig den chineál a bhfuil cónascadh á dhéanamh uirthi.  Luaigh mé cinn eile.  Is é dearcadh an Rialtais ná go bhfuil an-chuid áisíneachtaí sa tír agus go gcaithfidh muid comhtháthú a dhéanamh.  I mo thuairim, is é an phríomh rud ná go mbeidh seirbhís iomlán agus seirbhís chomh maith ar fáil nuair a bheidh an cónascadh curtha i gcrích, cibé cén dóigh a ndéanfar sin, agus atá go dtí seo in Oifig an Choimisinéara.  Bhí mé san oifig agus tá meas agam ar a chuid oibre.  Tá mé cinnte agus lán dóchasach nuair a bheidh an próiseas seo críochnaithe go mbeidh an oifig lán chomh héifeachtach agus atá sí anois.Luaigh an Teachta an Bhreatain Bheag.  Bhí Acht teanga acusan agus thug muide isteach Acht teanga cosúil le Acht na Breataine Bige.  Sílim go bhfuil an Bhreatain Bheag ag cur an tAcht teanga ar ceal anois agus go bhfuil sí ag tabhairt isteach coimisinéir.  Athraíonn rudaí ó thír go tír.  Mar a dúirt mé, tuigim an obair thábhachtach atá le déanamh maidir le cur i bhfeidhm an Achta nuair a bheidh sé leasaithe.  Beidh reachtaíocht le tabhairt isteach chomh maith.  Tá an tAcht agus Ombudsman bunaithe ar reachtaíocht agus tá muid i dtús phróisis.  Tá an comhairliúchán ag dul ar aghaidh agus is cinnte go mbeidh deis againn éisteacht le tuairimí gach duine agus scaifte sula mbeidh na cinntí agus na sonraithe críochniúla déanta.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for taking this topical issue and for his recent reply to my questions regarding the flooding in Dublin city.  I welcome both the long-term redress measures outlined in the Minister of State's reply to me and the different stages in which things will happen in the next couple of years.  However, I am greatly concerned by the here and now and by what measures are being taken to help flood victims living across the Camac and Poddle rivers, many of whom have been left homeless for weeks with nothing but the clothes they wore on their backs when they left that evening.  As winter approaches, what is being done by the Office of Public Works and Dublin City Council with regard to the recurring floods that may take place in the coming weeks and months?Last month, residents of Kilmainham Lane, Carrickfoyle Terrace, Millbrook Terrace, Harold's Cross and Kimmage were devastated by the flash flooding.  In a matter of minutes, some suggest it was as few as eight minutes, their homes were completely flooded and in some cases, to an extremely dangerous level.  Having witnessed personally many houses that had been flooded to the ceiling, it was difficult to understand how people had managed to escape.  All their possessions were destroyed and in some cases, major structural damage was done to the houses with the result that some people may never enter them again.  For instance, this is the third time since the 1940s that the Lady's Lane-Carrickfoyle Terrace area has been flooded.  As a result of flooding in the past, residents there have found it very difficult to get insurance.  Moreover, it now appears as though the small number who previously have managed to do so will not be able to get insurance in the future.  At present, with nothing but sandbags to keep the water out of their homes, they themselves state they have no hope of being insured by anyone unless immediate action is taken.I wish to compliment the Civil Defence, the emergency services and Dublin Fire Brigade in particular, which reacted quickly on the evening of the flooding.  They appeared in certain areas within minutes simply to help people from their homes, never mind to deal with the water that was surging through the walls.  As the water level rose quickly, there was little time to save many of the homes, some cars and in particular, personal belongings.  I stood in many houses after the waters had subsided and many residents had lost treasured and beloved personal items that never can be replaced.  Tragically, as Members are aware, two people lost their lives during the floods and one must do everything possible to prevent such deaths in future.At present, sandbags along the Camac River are not the solution.  A permanent emergency structure must be installed to reinforce the boundary wall of the river.  I am not an engineer or anything like that but in the past I have noticed how some places have been shored up with steel plate girders to reinforce the banks while waiting for the measures that will be taken later.  I understand perfectly that money and everything else may be an issue.Unfortunately, however, many of the people concerned have been left with nothing.  I am very concerned about them, their mental health and everything else.  They still feel abandoned and that they have been left on their own.  I ask the Minister of State to make a statement on what can be done to immediately help them.  I welcome the Minster for Social Protection, Deputy Burton's fund of €10 million which has really started to kick in, although it has taken time to organise on the ground.  If anything can be done immediately to help those living on the banks of this river who find that their only protection against another flood in coming months is sandbags, it should be done.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to set out for the information of the House some issues regarding the Camac and Poddle rivers.  Many residents of Dublin city suffered trauma on the night of 24 October.  I take the opportunity to express my personal sympathy and concern to the victims of the flooding, in particular those who lost family members, and other members of the public who had homes and businesses destroyed.The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, as the co-ordinating Department, under the emergency management framework is carrying out an in-depth review of emergency response procedures, actions and mechanisms with a view to identifying improvements within the framework.  In the light of the severity of the flooding event on 24 October, that Department is carrying out a review of the event for consideration by the Government task force on emergency planning at its next meeting.I understand Dublin City Council is still compiling its reports on the impact of flooding in its area, including the impact of the flooding of the Camac and Poddle rivers on the night of 24 October.  Owing to the multiplicity of the flooding instances on the night, it will take some time to complete this report.  When it is completed by the council and it asks the OPW to take action, either by way of the minor works scheme or alternatively by way of a longer term solution, possibly under the CFRAM proposal, we will follow up on this.  I assure the Deputy the funds are available in the Department, although the lead Department is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Our task is to respond to ideas that come from local authorities.  We have yet to receive the report but when we do, we will work with the city council on the measures that can immediately be taken.The minor works scheme is very effective because applications come in on a 24-7 basis to my Department and are turned around on one criterion only, namely, that if there is any value to be gained in spending the money, we will spend it.  However, we are in the hands of Dublin City Council until it brings forward applications on a range of measures it considers necessary.  We will then take action.  Funds are in place this year and for next year.  We have managed to ring-fence the capital budget for the purposes of flood defences, which are very important.  Approximately €250 million will be spent in this area in the next five years, some €45 million each year for the next five years.As I said, we are very much in the hands of local authorities.  I can understand in the case of Dublin City Council why it might take some time for it to assess the damage done and produce a report.  When the report is received by my Department and we are asked to take action on emergency or more long-term measures arising from the CFRAM study of both rivers being examined, we will take action.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I am happy that money has been put aside.  I perfectly understand that dealing with what happened in October crosses many Departments.  However, since the initial response was made on the night by Dublin City Council, it has taken a while to get things in place.  I know about the concerns of people living along the Camac, that the only things between them and rising water in the next couple of weeks are sandbags.  I hope the Minister of State's Department or Dublin City Council will consider providing for an emergency structure, for example, steel plates to provide reinforcement.  On Lady's Lane, many people have begun to clear out their homes to undertake remedial works to try to get back to live in them in basic conditions; many are living with their families, sleeping on settees and so on.  This is not an adequate solution to their problems.Many apartment blocks were flooded on the night and many people lost cars.  I have heard stories that people are still being asked to pay management fees and rent, although in some buildings the electricity has not been switched back on.  While that has nothing to do with the Minister of State, I make the point nonetheless.  Although I may have to raise this issue with other Departments also, I welcome the response of the Minister of State and hope that when the report is compiled by Dublin City Council, the work will be done quickly for those who want to remain in their homes for the next 100 years, given that the houses on Lady's Lane are 140 years old.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I again thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  Mine is a funding Department which gives out money based on applications received.  Within the Department there is considerable expertise in engineering and hydrology.  We will work with the local authorities concerned.I understand the Deputy's frustration at the length of time it is taking to have the report published.  In each of the affected local authority areas, whether it be South Dublin County Council or Dublin City Council, it takes time to find out the number of houses affected and the number with or without insurance.  Obviously, it is very important when an event happens that we encourage people in the first instance to contact their insurance companies.  Most of the claims have already been made and are being turned around.  As the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has informed the House, there is a very substantial humanitarian fund of up to €10 million available which can be accessed on the basis of needs, particularly by those who do not have insurance cover either because they are unable to obtain such cover because of a past event or, alternatively, because they cannot afford it.  It is crucial that we turn around applications as soon as possible and receive the report.  We would appreciate any effort the Deputy could make with the local authority to have applications submitted to us and she may be assured that they will be turned around as quickly as possible.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his staff for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter which relates to the provision of funding for the Northside Community Law Centre, an independent, community-based legal centre which serves to protect the legal, social and economic rights of individuals and groups.  It provides services for individuals and groups which reside in the Dublin North-Central and Dublin North-East constituencies, as well as for other residents in north Dublin.  It is a registered charity and governed by a voluntary board of directors.  More specifically, it seeks to provide free information and advice for those individuals who require legal advice but are not in a position to pay for it.  It also seeks to raise awareness in the community of issues that have an effect on it and empower residents through education and other campaigns.Last year the centre assisted over 3,300 people with information, advice and legal representation.  Its services were most readily sought in dealing with family law issues, welfare queries and employment law matters.  A significant amount of advice was also proffered on debt and debt resolution issues.  The centre has embraced new legal remedies and facilitated mediation on a range of issues such as parental conflicts, workplace difficulties.  It also provides conflict coaching.  The number of volunteer hours amassed by the centre in 2010 came to an impressive total of 1,500.The centre was able to provide its invaluable services owing to funding provided by the Department of Social Protection.  In fact, 63% of the centre's income came from the Department last year, in addition to some funding provided by the Law Society of Ireland, the Bar Council of Ireland and the Community Education Network.  The funding from the Department of Social Protection, which represents 45% of the centre's funding, was continued for this year but there was a 17% reduction in it.  The Bar Council of Ireland has not provided funding this year to date and now the centre is faced with the prospect that the Department of Social Protection will not be in a position to provide funding next year.  The centre has been advised that the funding stream is not secure and that it needs to secure funding from alternative sources such as the Department of Justice and Equality.The law centre has carried out a comprehensive investigation of the possibilities of securing funding from other sources, but the Department of Justice and Equality has informed the centre that it is already funding FLAC, which its considers is providing a very similar service and as such it would not be in a position to fund the centre.I have spoken in depth with the management of the centre and it has highlighted the differences between the service it provides and the service FLAC provides.  Unquestionably, FLAC provides a very good service but it is not at the heart of the community on the northside where the Northside Community Law Centre is based.  The centre has been operating in the area since 1975 and knows its community and the problems and obstacles the people there face.  It does not simply make legal representations for individuals when the need arises but is dedicated to providing ongoing training and support to members of the community on issues that affect them in their daily lives.  The centre can be said to be more accessible than FLAC as there are advice clinics held on a weekly basis as opposed to on a monthly or fortnightly basis.  A dedicated family law solicitor is on hand every two weeks and appointments outside this timeframe can also be made.A significant factor is that the law centre provides advice on appointment with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and it is specifically retained to advise MABS.  This gives the centre a significant insight into the debt concerns and problems people are experiencing and it is very knowledgeable about the debt problems that average households in the communities face.  The centre is critically aware of the problems in this area and as such is well equipped to inform the community on how to navigate through their difficulties with debt.Funding for the centre is an important issue and one that needs to be addressed in light of the service it provides to a significant number of people on Dublin's northside.  If the centre is unable to secure future funding from the Department, it will not be able to provide the service on which so many people have come to rely.  To ensure those most vulnerable are represented and have access to free legal advice and support, we must ensure the funding is made available.  On behalf of my constituents in Dublin North-East, I call for funding to be made available to ensure the Northside Community Law Centre can continue its invaluable work.  I hope to receive an assurance from the Minister of State that discussions can resume with the Department of Social Protection on this matter.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The Minister for Justice and Equality has asked me to thank Deputy Flanagan for providing him with the opportunity to debate this matter.  The Minister understands that the Northside Community Law Centre, NCLC, which is based in the Northside Civic Centre, Dublin 17, has been in operation since 1975 and that it was the first community law centre in the Republic of Ireland.The Minister notes from its website that the NCLC provides services to individuals and groups that reside within the Dublin North-Central constituency and Deputy Flanagan's constituency of Dublin North-East.  The NCLC, in addition to being a community law centre, is an independent law centre and, as such, is not one of the local law centres established by the State to provide legal services in regard to civil law matters by the Legal Aid Board.The Legal Aid Board, which comes under the remit of the Department for Justice and Equality, is an independent, publicly funded organisation.  It has been in existence since 1979 and was set up as a statutory body on foot of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  The board's objective is to provide a professional, efficient, cost-effective and accessible legal aid advice service.  The board has an executive management structure primarily located at its head office in Caherciveen, County Kerry and also at an office in Mount Street, Dublin.  Most importantly, particularly in regard to this debate, the board also has 33 full-time law centres located throughout the country, including seven such centres which are located in Dublin.  The board also operates a private practitioner service, a refugee documentation service and a library service in Montague Lane, Dublin.  In addition, the functions of the Legal Aid Board were recently extended to include a family mediation centre.In 2007, just over 10,150 persons sought legal services from the board in regard to general civil, non-asylum, matters.  This figure increased to 17,175 in 2010 while the number of applicants in the first six months of this year was almost equal to the total number for the 12 months of 2007.  As these figures clearly demonstrate, the Department of Justice and Equality and its agencies are, due to reduced financial resources being available, under severe pressure to meet the demands placed on them to provide existing services.The Minister for Justice and Equality understands that the Department of Social Protection has for some years provided finance to the NCLC.  The Minister is informed that a number of meetings took place earlier this year between the NCLC and officials from the Department of Social Protection and that, as a result, a total of €350,000 is to be made available to the law centre during 2011.  The Minister for Justice and Equality further understands that the Department of Social Protection will not be in a position to provide such financial assistance going forward.The Department of Justice and Equality does not fund the NCLC.  It has been approached on several occasions in recent years regarding funding for the law centre but no funding source was identified or money made available to the NCLC.The Department of Justice and Equality funds the Legal Aid Board which provides civil legal aid to persons of insufficient means.  While the Minister acknowledges the service provided to the community by the NCLC he does not have any financial resources which he can allocate to it or to similar bodies.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	394	Yes.  I thank the Minister of State for replying to this matter.  The Northside Community Law Centre assisted 3,300 people last year with the provision of advice, representation and education.  It provides many services to people on the northside.The centre received funding of €350,000 from the Department of Social Protection this year and it seeks that such funding will be ring-fenced and will continue to be provided for next year — it is not seeking an increase in funding.  Historically, the centre was funded through the Department of Social Protection but the Department of Justice and Equality has a responsibility in this area in that solicitors are being provided with training through intern schemes in the law centre and various services are being provided.  Volunteers provided 1,500 hours freely to deal with various issues and queries.  Debt issues can be complex and that is the reason people need help.  They would not use this facility if there was no demand for it in the first place.  It is imperative that this issue be dealt with.  The centre has been at the heart of the community since 1975 and the amount of funding required is very small.The centre has been involved in innovative solutions in the area of mediation in terms of the community, parental, workplace and elder mediation and conflict coaching.  It has been innovative and has provided a great deal of education, support and training for law graduates as well as helping people in the general community.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Department of Social Protection continues discussions with the law centre to ensure it remains on a stable footing for next year.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I appreciate the point the Deputy makes regarding the extraordinary work that goes on in the centre and the impact it has had on so many people who need recourse to legal advice but do not have means to get that privately.  I understand from the reply that discussions are not ongoing and that the view of the Department of Social Protection is that this money is not being ring-fenced.  I understand from the Department of Justice and Equality that it cannot provide funding for it either.  That is fairly concrete evidence from what both Ministers have said.  If this issue can be taken up again with either the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Justice and Equality——

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	397	It needs to be.  I advise the Deputy to raise it directly with both Ministers.  I will certainly make sure that both Ministers are fully informed of the important contribution he has made here and the case he has put so eloquently for the law centre and its work.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I welcome the Minister.  Three blocks of quite new apartments, namely, the Foundry, the Forge and the Kiln, are based at the junction between Railway Street and Beaver Street in Dublin 1.  Some of these are private apartments and others belong to Dublin City Council under Part V arrangements.  All three blocks are part of the same overall development which was developed by Townlink Limited.Bord Gáis conducted an inspection of some of the apartments in the Foundry and discovered degradation in the gas flues.  It then decided that the other units in the development would need to be inspected to establish the extent of the problem.  On inspection of the Kiln and the Forge it was discovered problems also existed there.  Bord Gáis then decided to turn off the gas supply to these units until a full inspection could be done by a competent engineering company.The problem rests with the developer who used McKeon Brothers mechanical engineering company to carry out the installation.  The boilers were sourced from a UK company which was contacted about the problem and insisted on coming to Dublin to monitor and inspect the work to be carried out to rectify the matter.  Parts had to be obtained which caused a further delay.The initial problem started on Thursday, 8 November, but nothing had happened by the weekend which is when I began to receive calls.  Luckily it has been a relatively mild November but one can imagine what it would have been like if it had happened last year.  People have been deprived of all heating and cooking facilities for more than a fortnight.  Dublin City Council provided heaters after a number of days had passed but the private owners of other apartments are in difficulty with little assistance.I understand work is to begin today with the parts having being supplied.  However, it was also supposed to have begun last week.  I am not sure how long it will take.  It is of major concern that part of the original construction and design work of three new blocks of apartments was faulty.  The gas flues between the ceilings and upper floors were not properly secured and degradation has already occurred in the joints.  This sounds very serious, and if this is the case, are we sure these are the only flaws in the construction and design?  I am concerned about the safety of the tenants and residents.  Their discomfort is the immediate problem but no home owner or tenant walking into a brand new development would have expected something like this would happen so soon.There have been many problems with pyrite in the constituency, and elsewhere we have had issues such as the inadequate development at Priory Hall.  I am very concerned that we will find similar problems here.  Will the Minister ensure when the work is completed that an independent survey is conducted of the construction, design and completed work?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I thank Deputy Costello for raising this matter.  Dublin City Council is aware of the serious safety concerns about the premises at Railway Street and is already taking appropriate steps to address the situation.  The safety of the residents is of paramount concern and I appreciate this is a stressful time for all concerned.The residential units at Railway Street were built by a private developer.  Dublin City Council purchased 25 units for social housing and took possession of them in 2005.  This includes 16 units at the Kiln and nine units at the Forge.Following boiler problems reported by residents, I understand the gas company investigated the matter and became concerned with the way the gas boiler flues were installed.  Potential health and safety concerns required the disconnection of gas supply to some units in the Forge and the Foundry.  Eight of the nine social housing units in the Forge were disconnected and the tenants were supplied with electric heaters by the council.The legal requirements in relation to building works to new and existing dwellings are set out under the Building Control Acts.  Part J of the building regulations in particular addresses the technical and safety issues relating to heat producing appliances.  Part D of the building regulations specifies that materials, which includes components and fittings such as heating appliances and their flues, should be fit for their intended use and installed to a proper standard of workmanship.  A comprehensive suite of related technical guidance documents provide detailed guidance on how to comply with the regulations in practice.Responsibility for compliance with the regulations rests with the builder and the owner of a building.  Enforcement is a matter for the local building control authority, which is empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings when considered necessary.Representatives of the residents met the developer following which the contractor responsible for installing the heating system agreed to inspect the units and rectify any problems.  The contractor went on site on Tuesday and is working from a vacant unit made available by Dublin City Council.  It is expected that the work will take five weeks to complete.  The manufacturer of the boilers has also sent a representative on site to ensure the works are completed to its recommended standards.I am satisfied that Dublin City Council as the designated building control authority and housing authority has the wherewithal to effect a satisfactory resolution in this matter.  The overriding priority is to ensure the optimum outcome for the households concerned by ensuring that defectively installed heating systems are remediated and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  I have asked Dublin City Council to liaise with the tenants in this regard to ensure that any issues in the social housing units are rectified immediately and satisfactorily.  The Department will continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council on the matter.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is of great concern that the expected works will take approximately five weeks to complete.  The initial estimation was that it would take only a few hours.  In five weeks' time we will be well into the Christmas period and the inconvenience the residents will have experienced between now and then will be enormous.  It will mean being without proper heating and cooking facilities for almost two months.  This will be a nightmare for them.  It is not acceptable that more than two weeks have already passed since the matter was identified but the work is still not taking place.  I am not sure anything happened on Tuesday.  I understand work was to commence today but we do not know what problems will arise.Is it possible to do something to speed up the process and ensure the work is carried out and completed before Christmas?  This involves families who require heating, cooking and privacy.  They do not want to have workmen in their homes over the Christmas period.  This would be a nightmare and unacceptable.  Will the Minister ensure every effort is made to have the work carried out more quickly?  Whatever extra measures or personnel are required to have it done in double time should be used so the workmen will have left the premises well before Christmas.  Will the Minister also ensure that Dublin City Council carries out a full inspection after the work is complete so that we have a report on the matter which will tell us where we are?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I share the Deputy's concern about the speed with which the work will be carried out.  I certainly undertake to contact Dublin City Council to ensure the work is completed as quickly as possible.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the issue of health and safety is the overriding concern for the tenants.  We do not want any particular difficulty arising from the escape of gas or any technical issues that might cause damage to the health of tenants.  Each unit must therefore be inspected individually and this may involve accessing the ceiling void to inspect fluids, connections and joint fixings.  I am told that some extra brackets may have to be installed.  The location of the boiler may have to be changed in a small number of units and it is expected to take that length of time in order to do all that.  I am talking about the overall project, although not every tenant may be so affected.  The manufacture of the boilers, Valiance, which is UK-based, has also sent a representative on site to ensure the works are completed to the recommended standards.  I will convey the urgency of this matter to Dublin City Council later today.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	403	Under the Capital Investment Plan 2012-2016, capital expenditure by my Department is estimated to total some €190 million, comprising €44 million in 2012, €38 million in 2013 and €36 million each year for 2014, 2015 and 2016.With regard to the specific details of this expenditure, I am currently prioritising plans within the context of the forthcoming budget.  However, I anticipate that expenditure will focus in particular on supporting jobs in the film and TV sector, and in the Gaeltacht.  It will also seek to target investment in priority areas in the culture and heritage sectors that will support cultural tourism as one of the most important elements of Ireland's tourism product.Expenditure will also be directed at ensuring compliance with EU directives, including investment in alternative solutions for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting in special areas of conservation.  Other investment will support the built heritage, strategic developments in our national parks and the development of our waterways in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrews agreements.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I thank the Minister for his reply.  A recent Indecon report cited the ability of arts organisations to support employment, which is directly related to the overall income of such organisations.  The report also said this has recently been impacted by the constraints in public finances and the collapse in consumer demand.  The Minister is now saying that in the coming years we will see significant reductions in the arts budget.  The Indecon report, the recent creative capital report and others all state that there is scope for the arts sector to create jobs.  Despite a serious cutback in departmental investment in the arts sector, is the Minister satisfied we will still be able to realise the job creation we so badly need?  Independent experts have signalled that the arts industry is due to grow, so should we not at least maintain our current level of expenditure for that sector?

Hopefully, the arts, heritage and Gaeltacht areas will not take a big hit.  I remind the Deputy that my Department was an amalgamation of a number of other departmental sections.  The arts, for example, came from the former Department of Arts, Culture and Tourism.  The arts budget was reduced from €78 million to under €32 million from 2008 to 2011, under the previous Government.  Meanwhile, heritage was reduced from €63 million to under €11 million this year, a drop of 83%, again under the Deputy's party's Government.  The budget for the Gaeltacht and islands was reduced from €73 million in 2008 to €12 million this year, which is minus 83%.  Even the North-South body's budget was reduced from €11 million to €6 million this year, a reduction of 45%.I have therefore come from a very low base where massive capital funding reductions have already been impacting on this Department.  Hopefully, we will fare better with current funding.  I hope to make up some of the loss from the taxpayer by encouraging philanthropists to invest and others to become involved in the arts.  In the budget I hope to set up a mechanism through which philanthropy will be encouraged.  In addition, we will also get funding from other sources.I agree with the Indecon report.  I have been saying for years that there is a major multiplier in the arts.  For every euro invested there could be a tenfold return, which makes perfect sense.  Hopefully, current funding will not impact as much as capital funding.  In defence of previous Governments, over €1 billion in capital funding has been invested in arts projects, including creative spaces, in this country over the past decade.  There has been a major investment therefore in capital projects in the arts, heritage and to a lesser extent in the Gaeltacht areas in the last ten years.The important thing now is to retain current funding as much as possible so we can retain staff in places like arts centres.  We must also ensure there are programmes they can pursue.  In addition, Arts Council funding must be protected as much as possible as it funds the majority of these community groups, events and centres around the country.

Is é an cinneadh atá tógtha ag an Rialtas go ndéanfar feidhmeanna na hoifige sin a chónascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman agus go gcuirfear an cinneadh sin i gcrích i gcomhthéacs an athbhreithnithe ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 atá ar siúl ag mo Roinn faoi láthair.  Tá sé luaite go sonrach sna téarmaí tagartha don athbhreithniú go "mbreithneofar na forálacha a leagann amach ról Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga".  Ar ndóigh, tuigfidh an Teachta go dteastóidh leasú reachtaíochta chun Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga a chónascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman.Ba mhaith liom a mheabhrú fosta nach é Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga amháin an t-aon oifig Ombudsman atá luaite i bplean an Rialtais chun athchóiriú a dhéanamh ar an tseirbhís phoiblí.  Tá cinneadh tógtha ag an Rialtas oifigí éagsúla, a bhfuil feidhmeanna Ombudsman leo, a chónascadh ar mhaithe le cur chuige níos éifeachtaí agus níos sruthlínithe a chur i bhfeidhm maidir le seachadadh seirbhísí do shaoránaigh an Stáit.Tá na cinntí Rialtais seo tógtha mar chuid den athbhreithniú cuimsitheach caiteachais a thionscain an Rialtas agus atá faoi stiúir na Roinne Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe.  Tá próiseas comhairliúcháin leanúnach ar siúl idir an Roinn sin agus gach Roinn Rialtais eile mar chuid den athbhreithniú caiteachais chun gur féidir leis an Rialtas na cinntí cuí a thógáil.Is é €670,000 soláthar an Státchiste d'Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga i mbliana agus baineann circa €450,000 den tsuim seo le costais phá don fhoireann.  Déanfar cinntí maidir leis an soláthar airgid don Oifig do 2012 agus do na blianta ina dhiaidh sin i gcomhthéacs an phróisis meastachán.Ar ndóigh, tá sé ráite go soiléir ag an Rialtas nach sábháil airgid amháin atá á lorg sna cúrsaí seo.  Tiocfaidh na buntáistí is suntasaí as timpeallacht riaracháin níos simplí agus níos éifeachtaí a bheith ann, rud a thabharfaidh cuntasacht dhaonlathach níos fearr, níos lú dúblála agus línte freagrachta níos soiléire maidir le seachadadh seirbhísí don saoránach.

Tá an-obair déanta aige agus níl aon locht ar obair an choimisinéara.Ní buille tubaisteach don teanga é.  Dúirt an Taoiseach féin, an lá a fógraíodh an cónascadh seo, nach mbeadh aon titim, aon dul ar gcúl nó aon chúlú siar ar an tseirbhís nó ar údarás an Choimisinéara Teanga maidir leis an jab atá á dhéanamh aige faoi láthair.Níl aon rud socraithe go fóill ach an cónascadh a dhéanamh.

The package offers qualifying turf cutters the option of a financial payment over 15 years or their relocation to non-designated bog, where they can continue to cut turf.  Those wishing to relocate can avail of a financial payment or the delivery of cut turf while relocation sites are identified and prepared.  The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State.The Government is committed to achieving a solution to this issue that protects the interests of those who have relied on these bogs for their fuel needs.  I have held discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in recent weeks to ensure that sufficient funds can be made available to meet the various schemes which we have put in place for the cessation of turf cutting on special area of conservation, SAC, raised bogs.  I assure the Deputy that this Government will make available the funds necessary to meet our commitments in this regard.These funds will come from central Exchequer sources and from my Department's share of the environment fund.  Final allocations between the various schemes have not yet been made but I am satisfied that the total amount available to me will be sufficient to meet the demands over the coming years.  Decisions relating to the allocations for the various schemes will depend on the expected demand for these schemes.  My Department will give consideration to that matter over the coming weeks.  More than 520 applications have now been received for compensation, through the financial payment over 15 years or through relocation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.The remit of the Peatlands Council includes an opportunity to review the compensation and relocation arrangements and to make recommendations to me.  For example, the idea for the free delivery of turf arose at the council and was accepted by me as an interim measure while relocation arrangements were being put in place.  My Department has 348 applications relating to SACs not yet finalised.  The Department will write very shortly to these applicants to offer them the opportunity to transfer to the recently announced compensation scheme as an alternative to completing the sale of their land or turbary right.  Those who decide to remain in the purchase scheme will have their applications dealt with in due course.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseAny decision to declassify an SAC is a matter for the European Commission in accordance with Article 9 of the habitats directive, where it is warranted by natural developments, such as those caused by landslides, erosion, climate change or other natural phenomena.  As this does not arise with Ireland's raised bog SACs, it is difficult to see how a case for declassification could be made.  With regard to the voluntary bog purchase scheme, around €26 million has been paid to date since its launch in 1999 and more than 1,000 individual transactions have been completed.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	413	There is no point in saying there are obvious differences between us on the issue and we will not go through them today because I am not asking about them.  It is important to say that when the Minister mentions 15 years of compensation or the delivery of turf, that delivery is not for 15 years.  Although we may be happy about aspects of that provision, it is an issue for another day.Time will tell if we agree on the following issue.  The last thing we want is people who have not been cutting turf applying for compensation to help them with burning turf or getting alternative fuel in their files.  I flag this as a potential problem because the only people who have contacted me about the compensation package have turned out not to be entitled to the package because they have not cut turf for years.  I only discovered this on delving into their requests.  I told them there was no point in applying for the scheme but the vast majority said they would apply for it anyway because they might get it.  Whatever about what we disagree on, I presume we agree there is a shortage of money in the State and if we are to pay compensation to people — if people want compensation it is their own business, knowing the pitfalls around it — we must be wary of people taking advantage of the scheme who are not entitled to it when it was meant for others.

I totally agree with him that the compensation that has been made available will have to go to those people who are going to be seriously inconvenienced by having to relocate.  I am the first to accept that.  I totally agree with that.I am sure Deputy Flanagan is aware that I have been left with no option.  When I was given the responsibility for this matter I contacted the European Commission to see whether we could renegotiate or if there was any wriggle room.  I was told there was not.  I got advice from the Attorney General's office.  I was told there was no place to go.  As Deputy Flanagan is aware, we had given the commitment 20 years ago.  The European Commission wants us to enforce the law.There was a reference to the matter in a newspaper article today.  Commissioner Potocnik was clear at the Petitions Committee last Tuesday — we can all read the transcript of it — that the Commission will move against this country and issue an injunction against us.  This could be the first time ever for the European Court to do it, if we do not implement the law.  It is very serious.All I can do for people at this time is to ensure they are compensated properly and that we provide relocation options so they can continue to cut turf.  If either of those two solutions do not suit, we will deliver 10 tonne of turf to their house.  I assure Deputy Flanagan that I will do everything possible to help those people, including cousins of mine who are cutting turf on the one bog in Kerry that was designated.Deputy Flanagan was quoted in a newspaper as saying that 75% of people who cut turf on bogs with which he is familiar are willing to relocate and that it is only in a small number of cases that problems arise.  I would like to engage with the Deputy as much as possible to try to resolve the matter in whatever way we can.  I mean that sincerely.As Deputy Flanagan is aware, I have met with turfcutters and contractors and I am available to meet them anytime.  I went to Galway and Roscommon by helicopter last March.  I am available to help out in every way possible but, unfortunately, as a country we are left with no room for movement.  Everyone realises that at this stage.  We could be severely embarrassed and punished as well if we do not comply with EU legislation that we have transposed into Irish law in this House.

The origins of the practice are believed to date back to the medieval period.  Graves were generally marked by simple, low, upright stones or slabs that usually lacked inscription or other carving.All known cillíní are listed as children's burial grounds in the statutory record of monuments and places maintained by my Department in accordance with the requirements of the National Monuments Acts.  In all, details of 1,393 cillíní are contained in the record.Given their inclusion in the record of monuments and places, cillíní are entitled to statutory protection under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994.  This provision requires any person intending to carry out work at or in relation to a recorded monument to provide the Minister with two months advance notice of the proposal.  This allows my Department time to consider how the work may proceed in tandem with the protection of the particular monument.  Failure to comply with the requirement to notify the Minister is an offence under the Acts and is subject to significant penalties.I am advised that no proposals likely to impact on cillíní have been notified to my Department in recent years.

We are not talking about stillborn babies only.  Some of those buried in unconsecrated ground were victims of infanticide or suicide or people who died in mental institutions or industrial schools.  Quite a number of people were, for various reasons, not buried in consecrated ground.I accept what the Minister says about the sites that are included in the list of monuments, but there are far more in the country.  In many places, there is a reliance on local knowledge and folklore to protect them.  In many cases there are no living relatives but in a significant number of cases there are.Could the matter of unmarked graves be pursued with the archaeology departments in our universities?  There is a danger that they could be lost with development.

If the Deputy has any information about unconsecrated burial grounds or locations where investigations should be carried out, I ask her to bring that to my attention so that I can arrange for her to meet the National Parks and Wildlife Service and senior officials in my Department on this very sensitive issue whenever she would like that opportunity.  If she wishes to pursue this matter I will help her in every way possible.  I agree that this is a very sensitive issue.In our own neighbourhoods we have heard of where there were graveyards in the past where infants were buried in various circumstances.  We may not have documentary evidence to prove this but some of this information may be accurate.  If I can assist the Deputy in pursuing this matter, I will do so.

An interesting survey is being carried out in Milltown Cemetery in Belfast involving Queen's University Belfast.  I will bring the Minister's offer to the people who have been asking me about this issue.I recently read an article about a certain developer who moved a 4,000 year old megalithic burial tomb out of the way of a proposed development.  We know that developer's life has completely changed.  Maybe there is a lesson for us in protecting our ancient burial grounds.

I will shortly introduce a new Bill which will give further protection to monuments.  My Department is working on the Bill at present.  So much legislation associated with the troika deal and the financial situation is coming through that this Bill had to be delayed to some extent, but I will introduce it shortly.  I am sure Deputy O'Sullivan will want to take a further look at this area when the Bill is debated.  If the Deputy can give me more information on what is happening in Milltown Cemetery, especially the work by Queen's University, I would be very interested in that.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	429	Further to Ireland's obligations under EU law to protect rare and threatened natural habitats, it is clear that further turf cutting and conservation of Ireland's 53 raised bog special areas of conservation, SACs, are incompatible.  Earlier this year, the Government announced a compensation package for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting in these 53 raised bog SACs.  The package offers qualifying turf cutters the option of a financial payment of €1,000 per year, index linked, for a period of 15 years or, where feasible, their relocation to a non-designated bog where they can continue to cut turf.  To date, my Department has received in excess of 500 applications under this cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.In April, the independently chaired Peatlands Council was established, comprising representatives of turf cutting interest groups, environmental groups, Bord na Móna and my Department.  The remit of the council allowed it to review the compensation arrangements and to make proposals to me.  In this regard it was suggested in the council that the State should provide a delivery of turf to those who must stop turf cutting as an optional interim measure for those who wished to relocate to alternative sites.  My Department has now tendered for such a service.  The council is also exploring other approaches such as alternative ways of dealing with the long-term energy requirements of affected turf cutters.In terms of relocation, agreement has been reached on the terms and conditions for relocation from the first of the 53 raised bog SACs to alternative undesignated bogs where the turf cutters involved will be cutting in 2012.  This relocation can now be used as a template for other groups who wish to continue cutting on alternative bogs.I will continue to work with the Peatlands Council and with all interested groups in seeking to resolve all the issues which arise from the cessation of cutting.  In the longer term, I would hope that the proposed national peatlands strategy, which is now the subject of a public consultation process, will set out an agreed strategy of how we manage all our peatlands into the future.  The list of SAC raised bogs affected by the cessation requirement is available on my Department's website at www.npws.ie.

What proportion of the total number of people who are aggrieved by the measure is represented by the 500 applications for compensation or relocation?  Along with the prospect of offering alternative turf cutting to those whose traditional turf cutting is to be interrupted, has consideration been given to offering alternative conservation areas, through the European institutions, to enable those involved in turf cutting in traditional areas to continue while meeting the conservation requirements?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	431	In the past, and in the 20 years since we gave this commitment, the measure suggested by the Deputy might have been discussed.  However, at this stage the Commission is very clear about what it wants us to do.  It wants us to close the 53 bogs.  If we do not do that and if there is cutting on those bogs next February, the Commission will impose an injunction on us.  The Commission has been quite clear in that regard.  That requirement was repeated last Tuesday in the Petitions Commission by Commissioner Potocnik.  That is the stark reality.Meanwhile, the Government has put in place the National Peatlands Council.  We also put in place a reasonable level of compensation of €1,000 per year, index-linked, for 15 years.  If that arrangement does not suit people, the Peatlands Council has suggested that they be supplied with fuel and we have decided to provide people who can no longer cut turf with 10 tonnes of turf, whereas the average household's normal requirement is 7 tonnes.  It is a generous provision.  We are also looking for alternative bogs on a daily basis.  A solution has been found in Deputy Kitt's constituency and it would be important if he could support it in every way possible alongside Deputy Connaughton.A good solution was found in Clara bog in County Offaly, which is being turned into a tourist attraction with an interpretative centre.  To counties like Kildare, Roscommon and Galway, it can act as an example of the tourism potential of raised closed bogs that are fully intact, especially given their appeal to Europeans.  Our bogs resonate with the Dutch and Germans in particular, who have a genuine interest in Ireland's peatlands to the extent that they purchased some of them.  Holland is trying to grow bogs at great expense.  Ireland is being asked to conserve 2% of our boglands, representing just 1% of our original boglands.  The EU believes it is a reasonable request, but people will be inconvenienced and I am trying to look after them as best I can.

To what extent has an examination been carried out of whether those who have been displaced regard the level of compensation or the principle of the matter as the most important factor?  While it is important that we all concur with the notion of conservation, we must also have due regard to those who are directly affected.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	436	Although the number has not been verified, I understand there are approximately 1,500 active turf cutters in the designated bogs.  More than 500 people, nearly 33%, have applied for compensation.Deputy Durkan asked whether it was down to inadequate compensation or the principle of not being allowed to cut turf on their own bogs that people had grievances.  For some, including Deputy Charles Flanagan, it is the principle.  However, those people and the generations to come will continue to own their bogs under this scheme and we will give them nearby bogs that they can cut.  This is not unreasonable, particularly given that no one will take the bogs they own from them.  People should review the principle of being unable to cut.Since entering the EU, we have accepted the habitats directive and other directives to protect our environment and other parts of our landscape are protected.  For example, one can no longer take sand or gravel from a shoreline.  The bogs are an addition to those areas.If Deputy Durkan can influence people in County Kildare, I am willing to meet them at any time.  I have met people in counties Roscommon, Galway, Offaly and, of course, Kerry.  I have not met anyone in County Kildare yet, but I will discuss the matter with people there at any time and explain to them what we are trying to do.

Cé gur laghdú é sin ar na blianta roimhe sin, is tuar dóchais é gur cruthaíodh 704 post nua in 2010 i gcliant-chuideachtaí de chuid an údaráis.  Taispeánann figiúirí fostaíochta an Údaráis gur éirigh go maith lena chliant-chuideachtaí atá ag plé le heaspórtáil, i gcomhréir leis an treocht náisiúnta.  Chomh maith leis na cláir thacaíochta atá ag an údarás féin, rachaidh gnéithe den tionscnamh post a d'fhógair an Rialtas i mbliana chun leasa a chuid gníomhaíochtaí.As an soláthar iomlán de €19.6 milliún atá curtha ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta ón Státchiste in 2011, tá €6 mhilliún curtha ar fáil mar bhuiséad caipitil don údarás.  Chomh maith leis an tsuim seo, tuigim ón údarás go bhfuil tuairim is €7 milliún ar fáil dó ó fhoinsí eile, ar a n-áirítear díol sócmhainní agus aisíocaíochtaí deontas.  San iomlán mar sin, tá buiséad caipitil de thuairim is €13 milliún ag an Údarás i mbliana chun tacú le cruthú agus le caomhnú fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.  Déanfar cinntí faoin soláthar a bheidh ar fáil don Údarás ón Státchiste don bhliain 2012 mar thoradh ar an athbhreithniú cuimsitheach caiteachais atá ar siúl faoi stiúir na Roinne Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe agus i gcomhthéacs an phróisis meastachán.Ar 31 Bealtaine 2011, thóg an Rialtas na cinntí polasaí seo a leanas maidir le struchtúr agus feidhmeanna Údarás na Gaeltachta go mairfidh an status quo maidir le feidhmeanna reatha Údarás na Gaeltachta go ginearálta, a chuid feidhmeanna fiontraíochta san áireamh; go mbeidh an fhreagracht maidir le forfheidhmiú na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge laistigh den Ghaeltacht ar Údarás na Gaeltachta; agus go ndéanfar foráil faoin mBille Gaeltachta atá beartaithe chun bord an Údaráis a laghdú go suntasach agus chun deireadh a chur leis an riachtanas do thoghcháin do bhord an Údaráis.Tá na dréacht-chinn den Bille Gaeltachta a thabharfaidh feidhm do na cinntí seo, de réir mar is cuí, dréachtaithe ag mo Roinn.  Táthar ag súil na dréacht-chinn a chur faoi bhráid an Rialtais go luath.  Tá an Bille Gaeltachta le foilsiú in 2012, de réir chlár reachtaíochta an Rialtais.Maidir le post phríomhfheidhmeannach Údarás na Gaeltachta, tá céimeanna sa treis ag an Roinn faoi láthair chun cead na Roinne Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe a fháil chun an post sin a líonadh i gcáil bhuan.Mar fhocal scoir, níl aon dabht ach gur comhartha muiníne é na cinntí polasaí atá tógtha ag an Rialtas i gcás Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Mar thoradh ar shaineolas agus ar thaithí Údarás na Gaeltachta sa Ghaeltacht ón uair gur bunaíodh é in 1980, tá cinneadh tógtha ag an Rialtas go leanfaidh an Údarás ag plé lena réimse saineolais agus le cur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.

Mar shampla, tá 20,000 duine dífhostaithe anois i dTír Chonaill.  Tá 22,000 duine dífhostaithe i nGaillimh agus ar fud na ceantair Ghaeltachta sa tír tá na mílte daoine dífhostaithe agus mílte daoine eile ag dul ar imirce.  Is ceist phráinneach í seo.  Tá an tAire Stáit ina chaothaoir aireach le hocht mí anuas ag an mbomaite seo, ach fós tá Údarás na Gaeltachta i Liombó.  I mo thuairim, tá an tAire Stáit ag bogadh ar luas seilide i dtaobh príomhfheidhmeannach an bhoird nua a cheapadh.  Níl slí toghcháin an bhoird nua roghnaithe fós aige agus tá an caipiteal infheistíochta laghdaithe, mar adúirt sé, ó €26 mhilliún go €6 milliún faoi láthair.De réir an tuairisc inniúchta, teastaíonn €12 milliún ón Údarás chun na poist atá ann anois a choimeád.  Má leanann an tAire Stáit ar aghaidh, beidh clú air mar an duine a chuir deireadh leis an Ghaeltacht.  An bhfuil an tAire Stáit ag iarraidh sin a dhéanamh?  Gan phoist, ní bheidh daoine ann, gan daoine ní bheidh teanga ann agus gan teanga ní bheidh an Ghaeltacht ann.  Gan an Ghaeltacht ní bheidh aon tobar teanga ann do phobal na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  Gan an Choimisinéir Teanga, ní bheidh cearta teanga ag muintir na hÉireann.  Táimid go léir bréan den bhriathar, ba mhaith linn beart.

Nuair a bhí deis agus pribhléid agam cuairt a tabhairt ar Ghaeltacht atá i ndáilcheantar an Teachta féin seachtain ó shin — bhí searmanas aoibheann againn i Rath Carn — chuir mé mo thuairimí ní hamháin mar Aire Stáit ach mar dhuine a rugadh agus a tógadh le Gaeilge in iúl gur comhartha dóchais é an rud atá á dhéanamh acu i nGaeltacht a bunaíodh sna 1930í agus atá ag dul ó neart go neart i láthair na huaire.  Tá an teanga le feiceáil ansin go soiléir, tá sí á labhairt i measc an phobail.  Aithním tábhacht na Gaeltachta.Aithním go bhfuil géar-ghá fostaíocht a chur ar fáil.  Mura bhfuil fostaíocht ann, is cinnte nach mbeidh daoine ann agus mura bhfuil pobal ann, ní bheidh teanga ann.  Aontaím leis sin.  Tá an-obair déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le blianta anuas.  Tá breis agus 7,000 ag obair i monarchan i gcliant-chomhlachtaí a dtug Údarás na Gaeltachta cuidiú, tacaíocht agus airgead dóibh le blianta anuas.  Ní bheidís ann ach amháin go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta ann.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil muinín agam in Údarás na Gaeltachta.Tá fadhb dhífhostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht; tá fadhb dhífhostaíochta ar fud na tíre agus níor tháinig na comhlachtaí faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta saor ó na deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta agus cailleadh poist.  Is dúshlán an-mhór é don údarás fiú na poist a cailleadh go dtí seo a athchruthú.  Ní fadhb í sin a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht, baineann an fhadhb sin leis an tír ar fad.  Sin an fáth nuair a tháinig mé isteach san oifig seo ocht mí ó shin go raibh imní orm agus ar an Údarás go raibh deireadh lena ré.  Nuair a tháinig foireann an Údaráis isteach ansin cad a tharla ach chuaigh an deontas ó €26 milliún anuas go dtí €6 milliún agus chuir sin scanradh, amhras, imní agus éadóchas ar an Údarás agus ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Sin an oidhreacht a fuair mé nuair a tháinig mé isteach, nach raibh ag an Údarás ach €6 milliún.Tá na deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta céanna againn go fóill.  Sin an fáth go ndéanfaidh mé gach dícheall dóchas a thabhairt don Údarás go mbeidh sé ann agus gur fhoilsigh mé an cinneadh a d'fhógair muid i mí na Bealtaine go mbeidh an t-Údarás ann agus cúraimí fostaíochta aige.  Bhí daoine ar thaobh eile an Tí agus sna meáin a rá go mbeadh deireadh leis an Údarás agus go gcuirfear isteach leis an ÚFT é.  Tá mé i mo sheasamh inniu agus an t-Údarás ann go fóill.

Bhí mé féin páirteach iontu nuair nach raibh mé anseo fiú.  Maidir leis an údarás tionsclaíochta, dúirt an Teachta go bhfuil sé ag tabhairt airgid amach do Shannon Development agus áiteanna eile.  Níor chuala mé sin go fóill.  Tá caidreamh an-mhaith idir Údarás na Gaeltachta, Fiontar Éireann agus an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail.  Bíonn cruinnithe ar bhonn leanúnach agus comhoibriú iontach idir na heagraíochtaí.  Tá an cuspóir céanna acu go léir — poist a thabhairt isteach sa tír agus a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht.  Luaigh mé níos luaithe go bhfuil cruinniú an-tábhachtach an tseachtain seo chugainn in Philadelphia le hinfheisteoirí agus tionsclaithe agus ní amháin go mbeidh Údarás na Gaeltachta ann, beidh an tÚFT ann chomh maith agus iad ag comhoibriú as lámh a chéile ar mhaithe leis an tionscal.Tá sé geallta i mBille na Gaeilge atá á ullmhú go mbeidh an comhoibriú sin idir Fiontar Éireann, an tÚFT agus Údarás na Gaeltachta mar tá an cuspóir céanna acu go léir, poist a thabhairt isteach sa tír, sa Ghaeltacht agus sa Ghalltacht.  Is í an Ghaeltacht mo phríomhchúspóir féin; tá daoine eile ag breathnú air seo taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá fadhb ann; tá deacrachtaí airgid ann agus déanfaimid ár ndícheall, leis an airgead teoranta atá againn, na poist seo a thabhairt isteach.  Ní mise a chruthóidh na poist seo, cruthóidh an t-Údarás agus tÚFT iad.  Tá feabhas ag teacht ar an gheilleagar agus cuireann sé áthas orm gur poist nua-aimseartha iad na poist atá á gcruthú sa Ghaeltacht anois, cuid acu teanga-bhunaithe, cuid eile bunaithe ar an nua-theicneolaíocht.

None the less my Department supports a number of schemes.  In 2011, I provided €650,000 through a structures at risk fund to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the planning and development Acts.  This fund replaced the local authority conservation grants scheme and the civic structures conservation grants scheme which were both suspended as a result of budgetary decisions in 2010.  The allocation for the structures at risk fund in 2011 is fully committed with 23 local authorities having been issued with grant offers for a total of 31 projects under the fund.  My Department is also providing capital assistance of €1.25 million to the Office of Public Works to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic properties and national monuments in State care, for example for works Cormac's Chapel in Cashel.My Department is also providing funding of almost €7.5 million to support the work of the Heritage Council.  This includes €1.5 million which is made available from the environment fund from receipts of the landfill and plastic bag levies.  The council supports a number of conservation grants schemes including the significant places of public worship grants scheme, the heritage management grants scheme, the large-scale heritage properties grants scheme, the conservation plan-led projects grants scheme and the Irish walled towns grants scheme which has, for example, just completed phase 3 works to Talbot's Tower in Kilkenny.  The level of funding available in 2012 and future years for these purposes will be subject to the normal budgetary and Estimates processes, noting that the total capital budget for my Department will see a further decrease next year.

Heritage was hit with an 83% reduction.  The reduction this year means there will be less funding for the protection of the built heritage.  We are doing our best to ensure that with the limited resources we have, we achieve as much as possible with those resources.  We had a huge allocation just two years ago for built heritage but it has been reduced drastically.  It follows that we will not be able to dedicate as much to conservation and protection of structures at risk.  Unfortunately that is the reality of the financial challenges we face.

Furthermore, the article provides that the Commission may only consider the declassification of a special area of conservation where it is warranted by natural developments.  As this does not arise in regard to the bog referred to in the Deputy's question, it is difficult to see how a case for declassification of the site could be made.Regulation 14 of the European Communities (Birds and Habitats) Regulations 2011 transposes Article 9 of the habitats directive into Irish law by providing for the de-designation of special areas of conservation where the agreement of the European Commission has been obtained.  However, as I stated, the decision to declassify is, in the first instance, is one for the Commission.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	455	If the Minister had been going home before the new motorway was built, he would have passed by Pike of Rushall between Mountrath and Borris-in-Ossory.  On each side there is a small bog, namely, Knockacollier bog, the larger of the two, and Coolrain bog, the smaller of the two.  The problem is that they have been designated as special areas of conservation.  Locals would be happy if the designation was lifted on either bog, even the smaller one, such that Coolrain bog would stay operational.  The Minister stated he could lift the designation only if it were warranted by natural developments.  The problem in south County Laois is that there are no options for relocation.The three methods the Minister has set out to deal with this issue are compensation, relocation and redesignation.  Compensation is a non-runner for turf cutters.  Relocation is also a non-runner, not because people want to be inflexible but because there is no suitable alternative bog within a radius of 20 km or 25 km.Designation has never been explained properly.  When were the people from the European Commission over on Knockacollier bog, or, as it is known locally, Butterisland bog?  Have they done tests on it, examined and re-examined it?  What straitjacket are we in?  Neither I nor the turf cutters have a problem working with the Department in seeking redesignation.  We can find other bogs that could be designated as special areas of conservation.  The problem is that in the small area in question both bogs have been designated.  People would be happy to use the smaller one only.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I can perfectly understand where the Deputy is coming from.  When the bogs were first designated, the designation was based on science, not economics or social implications.  I am sure that if the designator of the bog had realised the turf cutters would not be able to cut turf on it and would have to travel for miles if the adjacent bog was also designated, he or she would have considered the matter further.  I said this to the Commissioner when I met him and was very forceful in stating adequate consultation had not taken place at the time in question and that the people affected had not been sufficiently involved.  The result is the problem I am faced with today.  The practicalities in closing a bog without providing a real alternative to cut turf within an acceptable distance from the house of the people affected were not taken into consideration.I also raised the issue of redesignation when I met the Commissioner and it was just ruled out of order.  We signed up to the habitats directive 20 years ago.  We gave commitments to the European Commission that we would close all the bogs in question.  The discussion taking place should have taken place 20 years ago, at which time the Deputy was not in the House to raise the issue.  There is no doubt that people took their eye off the ball and did not realise the full implications of the directive for those using the bogs.  We are now threatened with injunctions.  I am convinced that there will be an injunction, judging from what we have all read following the petitions event last Tuesday.  The matter is serious.My officials have visited bogs around the country.  Any time I am driving home from the Oireachtas, I would not mind meeting the people affected by the designation with the Deputy and other colleagues to see at first hand the circumstances on the ground, if my doing so would be of any use to them.

Ar an ábhar sin, tuigfidh na Teachtaí nach mbeadh sé cuí domsa aon bhreithiúnas sonrach a thabhairt ag an bpointe seo maidir leis an tsamhail mhaoinithe iomaíoch nua.De réir an eolais atá curtha ar fáil ag Foras na Gaeilge, tuigtear dom go bhfuil 82 duine fostaithe ag na heagraíochtaí bunmhaoinithe.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	459	The arts, culture and creative sectors are important for the social, cultural and educative benefits that they bring to communities, large and small, around the country. They are an essential part of the narrative about the character of a new, different, changed and better Ireland. Indeed, I believe that dynamism in the arts and culture in turn leads to dynamism in a nation.Part of my brief as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is to increase awareness of the value and benefit of cultural activities.  I have already met the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss a range of ideas which are being further elaborated on by both Departments. The main aim of these proposals will be to increase engagement with the arts from the community up, with particular reference to young people.The national cultural institutions, which operate under the aegis of my Department, also play an important role in increasing awareness of the value and benefit of cultural activities.  In excess of 3.5 million people visited our cultural institutions in 2010, an increase of 7% on 2009 figures. The quality and diversity of the cultural exhibits and events on offer at our museums and galleries plays a key role in attracting such significant visitor numbers, and each has significant education and community programmes which are designed to create access to the institutions for all sectors of the public.My Department also supports the annual Culture Night initiative which has been such a spectacular success since its inception in 2006.   On Culture Night, arts and cultural organisations, including the national cultural institutions, extend their opening hours to allow for increased access. Indeed, one of our specific commitments in the Programme for Government is to expand the Culture Night concept and I have already set the wheels in motion in relation to this.My Department also provides a range of funding to other cultural institutions and regional and local museums throughout the country, which support our high-level goal in relation to enhancing access to the arts, culture and film sectors and recognising the social and economic role of these sectors in Ireland. Examples of bodies funded in this way are the Hunt Museum, Archbishop Marsh's Library and Foynes Flying Boat Museum.Question No. 13 answered with Question No. 7.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The legislation covering employment in local authorities is set out in the Local Government Act 2001, which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Under section 159 of that Act, each County and City Manager is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary to carry out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible.  A County or City Manager, who considers that there are insufficient staff resources to fulfil necessary obligations and functions, can apply to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for sanction to set aside the moratorium on public service recruitment.I, as Minister with responsibility for the Arts, am pleased that in the months since taking office I have engaged with the arts community at community, local and national levels.  I have met with many local arts officers.  In addition, my Department, in conjunction with Kerry County Council, has prepared a pilot interactive local authority strategy, which, I believe, will lead to more co-ordination in arts and culture activities at community and at local levels.  This strategy examines new approaches which will benefit the arts, craft and cultural tourism alike and can act as a template for any local authority which wishes to adopt a more interactive and consultative process.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	461	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently announced a radical streamlining of State bodies, including in respect of a number of bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group. This includes decisions to:combine the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland, while retaining their separate identities;merge the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission into the National Library, while maintaining their separate identities;merge the functions of the Language Commissioner with the Ombudsman's Office; andexamine options around shared services and the board structure of the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland.In addition, decisions have also been taken to critically review by June 2012 the streamlining and shared services agenda in respect of a number of other bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group, including the Chester Beatty Library, the Placenames Commission, the Heritage Council and Culture Ireland. More details in this regard can be accessed on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website at www.per.gov.ie.The Deputy will, of course, be aware of the real benefits that will come from a less crowded administrative landscape, resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for citizens — all leading to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.  In relation to savings that will arise from the rationalisation measures announced by Government, it has been estimated that savings of up to €20 million can be expected in relation to enhanced service efficiencies.With regard to the reduction of public service numbers across public bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group, I anticipate that these numbers will reduce over the coming period in line with my Department's Employment Control Framework. Indeed, the intended streamlining of State bodies can be expected to provide opportunities to redeploy staff to the areas of greatest need in the public service.I should also say that shared services have the potential to transform the efficiency of State bodies and my Department is actively pursuing this issue.  Sharing of back-office and other services will offer significant long term savings in the operation of State bodies generally and options in this regard are being examined by my Department.

I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies within its remit and I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for the arts sector.  In that regard I meet regularly with arts and cultural groups throughout the country to ascertain their views on the sector and to assist me in formulating the most appropriate polices to progress their activities.The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, that investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector and their potential for assisting with cultural tourism initiatives.  In the context of the 2012 estimates, I will, of course, be endeavouring to maximise continuing Government support for the arts and culture sector.On a practical level, over the summer I launched Culturefox, a mobile website and app to promote all Irish arts events.  The idea is that, because your smartphone is location aware, the Culturefox app immediately puts up on your screen all the arts events that are going on around you.  It lets you read about them, book tickets and even gives you directions to the venue.  The system is run by the Arts Council, and I understand that anyone running a bona fide arts event can upload and promote their event.

My own Department is responsible for the website www.irishgenealogy.ie, which contains nearly 3 million Church records of Baptism, Marriage and Burial from pre-1911, covering Dublin City, together with Counties Carlow, Cork and Kerry.  There is no charge for accessing this website.  It is also a valuable aid to those who wish to research their ancestry and, in conjunction with Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, it has a page dedicated to helping those who would like to visit the home of their forebears.  To date in 2011, over 320,000 visitors have visited this website.Since the National Archives digitised the 1911 and 1901 Census returns for all 32 Counties and made them available on-line in 2007, the use by the Irish public and the international Irish diaspora has been nothing short of remarkable, with almost 600 million hits registered on the website and 12.5 million visits.  Irish addresses account for just under half the hits/users and the remainder are people in the UK, the United States, Canada and Australia, New Zealand and the EU in descending order.  The 1926 Census was the first undertaken by an Irish Government and it is my intention to have the census returns digitised and made available on-line as a 1916 centenary project, subject to resources and the resolution of legal and other issues.I would also draw the Deputies' attention to a full-day seminar that I held on 7th September 2011 in the National Library of Ireland.  The seminar was attended by representatives from a wide range of organisations with an interest in genealogy matters.  Its purpose was to evince a more co-ordinated approach to this area.  Each organisation which attended was given an opportunity to make a presentation that outlined their views on the issue of digitising genealogical records and maximising the potential of roots tourism.  This involved some 30 presentations over the course of the day.  I am still considering the views of the various organisations on these important issues.

This legislation had the purpose of banning stag hunting by riders and hounds.  I have a broad remit to protect Ireland's wildlife and natural heritage.  One of my biggest challenges will be to work towards greater common understanding of the issues we face in protecting our natural heritage.  My Department also has significant challenges before it to ensure that Ireland is in full compliance with EU Directives on nature conservation, and that we ensure that the richness of Ireland's built and natural heritage contributes to national economic recovery.  It is my view that the resources of my Department should be focused on those areas.  I will continue to keep all provisions of the Wildlife Acts under review and introduce improvements to the law, where appropriate.

The focus of the review is to examine the potential merger of the functions of the Council into my Department.The Heritage Council has made a significant contribution since its inception in 1996 to vastly improving our collective appreciation and understanding of our rich national heritage.  However, the Government is intent on putting in place a more streamlined public sector and there have been significant legislative and policy developments in the heritage area since the Council was established, which need to be taken into account.  We need to consider how best to promote and cherish our heritage, and how best to deliver an accountable and high quality heritage service in the context of a smaller public sector and reduced resources.  This will be the focus of the review over the next few months.  Issues around levels of service and cost will be considered as part of the review, as will the context of the totality of resources available to my Department.On the general issue of ensuring the continued protection and enhancement of our national heritage, my Department will continue, within available resources, to:promote the role which Ireland's heritage has to play in making Ireland an attractive destination for sustainable tourism and inward investment, andprovide for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage in accordance with best practice and legal requirements, both nationally and internationally.

In 2011, the organisation referred to was paid a capital grant of €21,726 by my Department.  Funding for arts and cultural capital projects is primarily from the Cultural Development subhead of my Department, which has an allocation of €7.8 million in 2011.  This funding is fully committed and there is no scope for any further funding being provided.  The Deputy will appreciate that, given the current economic situation, it is unlikely that a new capital infrastructure scheme will be announced in the near future.  In any case, my Department has not received any further application for funding from the organisation in question.Applications for current funding should be directed to the Arts Council.  Under the Arts Acts 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent of the Minister in its funding decisions and in its processes and the Minister is not the responsible authority to the Dáil on these matters.  Section 24(2) of the Arts Act 2003 precludes interference by the Minister in Arts Council funding decisions.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	470	As the Deputy will be aware, the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) Plenary Meeting in July 2007 agreed to proceed with the restoration of the section of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne.  The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of €35 million. However, Government Accounting procedures do not provide, in that sense, for the ‘ring-fencing' of funds for projects of this nature.I am advised that it was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  I am advised that it was also a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets — a scenario that was affected negatively by the economic downturn.It was noted at the NSMC Plenary Meeting held in Armagh on Friday last 18 November 2011 that the Ulster Canal project is progressing incrementally.  In this regard, an application for planning for the project was submitted in October with the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction and I trust that the Deputy will agree that this is a significant milestone.  I can confirm to the Deputy that I intend to continue to explore all possible options that may assist in the advancement of this project.  To that end, I met recently with senior officials of Monaghan County Council, Fermanagh District Council and Waterways Ireland to discuss approaches to setting up an inter-agency group that could examine ways in helping to advance the Ulster Canal project.  I look forward to that work continuing in the period ahead.

I have met the chair and chief executive of NAMA in relation to the potential use of NAMA buildings for cultural purposes.  NAMA was set up to acquire loans from certain financial institutions and it does not own property as such.  In most cases, the property securing these loans is under the control of the debtor and will remain so as long as the debtor continues to meet his obligations.  In the case of certain debtors, NAMA has taken enforcement action and the property securing the loans is now under the control of receivers or other insolvency agents appointed by NAMA.  My Department will continue engagement with NAMA in instances where assets of shared interest arise.

The order was made on the grounds that No. 16 is a monument, the preservation of which is of national importance by reason of its historical significance as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the Provisional Government.  The effect of the order is that works affecting these properties, including any excavation or ground disturbance within, around or in proximity to them, will require my consent under section 14 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, as amended.The proposed development of the Carlton Cinema site, of which Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street form part, and for which approval has been granted by An Bord Pleanála, envisages the retention of these buildings and the provision of a commemorative centre to the 1916 Rising in No. 16.  The developer's application to my Department for consent to these proposals under section 14 of the National Monuments Acts is being examined.  As part of the process, I have visited the monument site and met various interest groups, including relatives of the 1916 leaders.  My Department is currently in consultation with the National Museum of Ireland in relation to the application and a decision will be made on it as soon as possible.  Any wider plans for the development of the Moore Street area would be a matter for the relevant landowners and the development authority, Dublin City Council.

Under this plan the Government proposes:—to combine the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland, while retaining separate identities;to merge the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission into the National Library while maintaining separate identities; andthat my Department will examine the issue of shared services and the Board structure of both the National Library and the National Museum.It is too early at this stage to identify what the practical effect of these proposals will be.  My priority, in implementing all of these decisions, will be the maintenance of service levels to the public and the maximization of shared efficiencies.

Following dialogue with local arts officers, a pilot interactive strategy has been put in place which, I believe, will lead to more co-ordination in arts and culture activities at community and at local level.  I believe that the next 5 years can be an exciting time for the arts, culture and film sectors.  Their integration into a new Department with the Irish language, islands and heritage responsibilities, makes eminent sense and I look forward to building on the self-evident synergies between these areas.The Government's priorities for the arts are set out in the Programme for Government, while responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved primarily to the Arts Council, as the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:to stimulate public interest in the arts;to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; andto assist in improving standards in the arts.The Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.

This includes decisions to combine or merge a number of such bodies. In addition, decisions have been taken to critically review, by June 2012, the streamlining and shared services agenda in respect of a number of other bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group, including in relation to the merging of the functions of Culture Ireland into my Department. More details in this regard can be accessed on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website at www.per.gov.ie.The Deputy will be aware that it is recognised, most recently at the Global Irish Economic Forum last month, that arts and culture are Ireland's global calling card and one of our world-class, distinctive strengths as a nation.  The international promotion of Irish arts through my Department's Culture Ireland programme has made a signficant impact — especially in the US this year with the Imagine Ireland   programme — in restoring our global reputation at a critical time and expanding international markets and audiences for Irish artists.  Equally, in the coming years, the promotion of Irish cultural and creative excellence in Europe and in key growth markets, such as China, offers vital opportunities for the country, working in tandem with the promotion of trade, investment, tourism, food and science.  In particular, our EU Presidency in 2013 will present a platform to strengthen our cultural links with key European partners, such as Germany and France.I am committed to ensuring that we will be able to continue to deliver the functions of Culture Ireland effectively in the future. The critical review requested by Government is already under way in my Department and I expect to be in a position shortly to take definitive decisions on the matter.

It is anticipated that the results of the impact assessment process will be available for consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget.  As is customary, I do not propose to comment in advance of the Budget on any matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 50 and 51 together.Income Tax relief in respect of trade union subscriptions was abolished in Finance Act 2011. This was in line with a recommendation of the Commission on Taxation.  The removal of this relief which previously applied to a large number of employees, suggested that, in order to provide a degree of equity, a similar measure should be implemented for those employees who are members of professional bodies. This was also accomplished by means of Finance Act 2011.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the tax years 2004 to 2010, Section 118(5E) Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provided that expenses incurred by an employer on behalf of an employee in connection with the payment (or reimbursement) of annual membership fees of a professional body were exempt from tax where such membership was regarded as "relevant to the business" of the employer. Following the enactment of Section 7 of the Finance Act 2011, this tax exemption is not available for the tax year 2011 and subsequent tax years.However, separate and distinct from the tax exemption provided for in Section 118(5E) TCA 1997, Section 114 TCA 1997 provides for a tax deduction in respect of expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily by an individual in the performance of the duties of his or her office or employment. In the context of annual membership fees of a professional body, whilst each case is examined on its own facts and circumstances, Revenue operate in accordance with guidance published in 2011.As regards professional subscriptions paid by a self-employed individual or by a practice, such subscriptions are a normal business expense in the accounts of the individual or practice in arriving at profit for tax purposes.  In relation to costs, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as regards employees, during the tax year 2010, Section 118(5E) TCA 1997 referred to above provided for a tax exemption as regards professional fees paid by an employer on behalf of an employee.  As such tax exemption was given at source by employers, figures are not available as to its cost.For professional subscriptions paid by an individual who is an office holder or employee, costing figures are not available in respect of expenses claims for tax relief under Section 114 TCA 1997 on the cost of such subscriptions wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by that individual in the performance of the duties of his or her office or employment. Such costs are subsumed into the overall tax cost of allowing relief under section 114 for the various types of expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by individuals in the performance of the duties of an office or employment.As regards professional subscriptions paid by self-employed individuals or by a practice, as such subscriptions are a normal business expenses in the accounts of the individuals or practice in determining profit for tax purposes, again tax costing figures are not available as the costs are subsumed into the overall tax costs of allowing tax relief for business expenses.  In circumstances where there is a need to maximise tax revenues as much as possible it is considered that the available tax relief should be tightly focused on fees that were absolutely essential to the performance by an individual of his or her job, profession or business.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	487	Income Tax relief in respect of trade union subscriptions was introduced in 2001. In 2008, the relief was increased to €350, which equated to a €70 tax credit per annum for union members.  The most recent year for which the necessary detailed information is available regarding tax relief for trade union subscriptions is the income tax year 2009, in which the cost to the Exchequer is estimated at approximately €26.7 million.This tax relief was abolished in Budget 2011. The Commission on Taxation recommended that the relief should be discontinued on the basis that membership of a trade union is more likely to be influenced by the benefits of membership. Furthermore, the Commission considered that there was a significant element of deadweight associated with this tax relief.Questions Nos. 50 and 51 answered with Question No. 48.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	488	The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 provided for a second reduced VAT rate, of 9%, on a temporary basis in respect of certain tourism-related services and goods for the period 1 July 2011 to end 2013.  This measure was estimated to cost €120 million in 2011, €350 million in 2012 and in 2013, and €60 million in 2014.  Businesses must account for VAT at the 9% rate on these specified goods and services provided by them on or after 1 July 2011.  Where the goods and services are supplied to another VAT-registered business a VAT invoice must be issued, charging VAT at the new rate.  However, where the supplies are to unregistered customers there is no obligation to show the VAT separately.  Businesses dealing with unregistered customers are not legally obliged to reduce their (VAT-inclusive) pricing to reflect the lower VAT rate, but would be expected to do so.However, in reducing the VAT burden on activities related to the tourism industry, the introduction of the 9% VAT rate is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.  With this in mind, the VAT reduction will be kept under review and evaluated before end 2012 in order to determine its effectiveness in aiding the industry.  If it is shown that the VAT reduction has little or no effect in aiding the industry then the measure is open to being reformed or abolished.  In addition, checks on the correct operation of VAT, including the rates of VAT applied are integral parts of Revenue's audit and compliance programmes.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	490	It is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	491	With regard to the decision to charge VAT on entrance fees to historic houses and open farms, I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that fees charged for entry to historic houses, stately homes and gardens (collectively referred to as historic houses) and open farms were until recently treated as VAT exempt "lettings of immovable goods".  This VAT exempt treatment followed a 1970s Revenue Appeal Commissioner's decision, in a particular case, relating to a right granted to a person to enter a house and gardens.Irish VAT legislation must be in accordance with the EU VAT Directive and must be interpreted in a manner set out in decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).  Having regard to a number of decisions of the ECJ, and a recent challenge by the owner of an historic house to the existing exemption from VAT of such activities, the entry fees to historic houses, and other facilities such as open farms, could no longer be treated as fees for VAT exempt lettings.  Therefore, in order to be compliant with EU law it was necessary to bring such fees within the charge to VAT.  A start date of 1 January 2012 was chosen to allow a lead in time to prepare for the 2012 season.  Full details of the changes were set out in a VAT Information Leaflet issued in August 2011.In relation to the different VAT treatment applied to historic houses and open farms, paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 provides that the reduced rate (at 9%) applies to admissions to exhibitions of objects of historical, cultural, artistic or scientific interest where these objects are displayed in a manner similar to a museum or art gallery.  So, for example, the display of furniture, paintings, etc. in a grand hall in an historic home is a display of historical or artistic interest.  However, as paragraph 8 does not apply to admission fees to open farms; such fees cannot apply at the 9% rate and as such are liable to VAT at the standard rate of 21%.I would point out however that an exemption from VAT may still apply to historic houses and open farms in certain circumstances.  Historic houses and open farms, like any other service business, may opt not to register for VAT if their entrance fee turnover is under the registration threshold of €37,500 per annum.  Where this is the case VAT will not apply to admission fees.In the case of historic houses and gardens, separate from their turnover, they may in addition qualify for VAT exemption under the "activities in the public interest" provisions set out in paragraph 3(5) of Schedule 1 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  This provides that an exemption may apply where the supply is of a cultural service by a cultural body.  In this regard, cultural bodies for the purpose of this exemption are determined on a case-by-case basis by Revenue, generally where such exemption would not distort competition and the body is non-profit making.While the impact of this new ruling on the tourist trade has not been evaluated, the change in the VAT treatment of entrance fees to historic houses and open farms was not optional; it was required in order to be compliant with the EU VAT Directive as interpreted by the ECJ.  I will, however, look at this issue further in the context of the Budget.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	492	Under Section 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 2011 responsibility for all functions relating to public sector superannuation matters was transferred to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who has responsibility for the Superannuation Vote (Civil Service pensions) and for pensions payable from the Central Fund.  The Paymaster General's Office in my Department acts as the paying agency for these pensions on instructions from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Pension payments are subject to the Public Service Pension Reduction at the following rates:First €12,0000%Between €12,000 and €24,0006%Between €24,000 and €60,0009%Above €60,000 12%In addition, pensions are subject to statutory deduction for taxation and Universal Social Charge, but the actual amounts deducted would depend on the individual circumstances of each payee.  Pensioners may also have voluntary deductions, for example, contributions to a health insurer.

The Government does not interfere in the day to day commercial decisions taken by the board and management of the bank including its product offerings.  The matter referred to in the Deputy's question would clearly fall into this category and I have no direct function in the matter.  The Central Bank of Ireland has a role in ensuring that the best interests of consumers of financial services are protected.  The Central Bank of Ireland's Consumer Protection Code stipulates the general principles that regulated entities must adhere to in all dealings with customers or potential customers.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 134(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) and Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 (Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (as amended) provide for permanent relief from the payment of specified maximum amounts of VAT and VRT for persons registered under the scheme.  A claim under the above scheme was received in the Central Repayments Office on 19th October 2011 from the person (details supplied).  This claim was processed on the basis of the invoice supplied, which referred to adaptations carried out on a V.W. Transporter.  A cheque issued on 1st November 2011 in respect of the repayment of VAT incurred on these adaptations.  In this case, the vehicle was a used vehicle which was purchased privately rather than from an authorised dealer.  No VRT was incurred by the named person and there is no further repayment due in respect of this vehicle.Correspondence has been circulated to the Irish Wheelchair Association and The Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland clarifying aspects of the legislation governing this Scheme.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.As I said in my reply to parliamentary question number 36529/11 yesterday, I wish to make clear that I and my colleagues in Government are deeply concerned that this draft confidential information has become public before Government had finally made all of the necessary budgetary decisions.  Furthermore, we are concerned at the manner in which this information was put into the public domain.As the Deputy will be well aware, we are in a programme of financial support with the EU and the IMF.  As part of this programme, we are obliged to share information with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF — the External Partners.  Such information is shared on a confidential basis, with the understanding that its circulation is restricted.  As such, certain draft technical information which is clearly signalled as being still subject to Government decisions is transmitted to the External Partners.  This information flow is part of the necessary transmission of information which is required to facilitate discussions amongst senior officials at Eurogroup Working Group level.Following each review mission by the external partners, the Irish authorities agree updated programme documents, specifically the Letters of Intent, the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. These are discussed between the partners and authorities in draft format before being signed and published.Each review considers both the performance against targets to date, and progress in relation to future commitments.  A key concern at all stages of the process is the sustainability of the fiscal position.  In that context, the external partners requested information about Ireland's next steps, specifically measures to be introduced in the Budget.  While the Government agreed to provide broad outlines in October, it was also explained that the final shape of the budget would not be known until budget day.While the overall scale of adjustment required each year out to 2015 was published in the Government's Medium Term Fiscal Strategy, the External Partners sought further specific information to facilitate approval of the review and thus the next drawdown of funds under the programme.  It was in this context that the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform provided some additional data on budgetary options on the understanding that this was for internal use by the External Partners as well as for background briefing by the Commission to the EuroGroup Working Group and the Economic and Financial Committee only.  This information was marked both draft and confidential and was contained within square brackets in the text — which is the normal way of showing that the relevant text remains to be finalised and subject to further decision making.  On many occasions during the Troika review mission and since then, we highlighted that such material was indicative and had to be agreed by Government before the documents could be finalised.As I understand it, and notwithstanding the strict confidentiality applied to the material supplied to the Troika, this information was sent by Commission staff to the German Finance Ministry.  It was then forwarded by them to their Parliament.  Neither Government nor the Irish officials were informed that this transmission of confidential budgetary documentation would take place.  Further, that this occurred before the information was agreed by Government and then provided to the Oireachtas serves only to heighten our concerns.  Since becoming aware of the leak and the internal Commission process that they have in place we have raised our serious concerns with the Commission, and also with the German authorities.Germany's Parliamentary requirement arises from its position as a guarantor of the EFSF and its own legal and constitutional provisions.  The process by which this is implemented is a matter for the German authorities.  We were nevertheless surprised to learn that documents that we provided found their way to the German parliament.In conclusion, I will repeat that the Government did not approve the transmission of this information to the German Parliament, and that I and my Government colleagues are very concerned at this development.  We must nevertheless recognise that we remain in a programme, and continue to rely on the support of the External Partners.  In expressing our concern, we need also to continue working with our partners.  On Tuesday, I laid the relevant draft documents before the Houses of the Oireachtas, in order to make the information available to all.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	496	VAT is charged on the supply of goods and services, and the rate applying is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  While many tourist related services were made subject to a new temporary lower reduced VAT rate of 9% from 1 July, it is not possible to extend this treatment to the goods and services that remain subject to the 13.5% rate.  While hairdressing services apply at the new temporary 9% rate, services consisting of the care of the human body, including beautician services, remain subject to the 13.5% rate.This arises from the fact that many of goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, including services related to care of the human body, have their basis under an EU derogation that provides that as we applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue applying that reduced rate to those items.  However, this continuation of reduced rate application is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%.  These are known as ‘parked' items, and are provided for under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive.  As beautician services are part of these parked items, it is not possible for Ireland to apply the rate of 9% to them.It is for this reason that the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 introduced a 9% VAT rate in respect of tourist activities such as restaurant and hotel accommodation services, while other tourist activities such as tour guide services and the short-term hire of cars, boat, caravans and mobile homes remain liable to VAT at the 13.5%.  However, it should be noted that in the majority of EU Member States services consisting of the care of the human body apply at their standard VAT rate of up to 25% in some cases, compared to 13.5% in Ireland.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.The taxation of individuals in the State is broadly in line with that prevailing in most other OECD jurisdictions.  In general,(a) individuals who are resident in the State for tax purposes are taxable here on their worldwide income and gains; and(b) individuals who are not resident here for tax purposes pay tax here only on income arising in the State and income derived from working here; those who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident are only liable to Irish tax on gains from certain assets in the State.The current residence rules are based on counting days of presence in the State.  An individual is regarded as resident if s/he is present in the State for 183 days in the current year and 280 days between the current year and the previous year.  These rules are in place since 1994.  Prior to 1994, the Irish tax residence rules were derived from case law rather than statute law and were broadly similar to the UK tax residence rules, which are still derived from case law.  The "91 days over four years" test, also called the "habitual residence" test, was abolished in Ireland in 1994 and replaced by the "280 day" test.Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 introduced changes for 2009 and subsequent years whereby an individual is regarded as present in the State for a day if he or she is present in the State at any time during that day.  Previous to this change an individual had to be present in the State at midnight on the day for that day to be counted.The "183 day" residence test is common among OECD countries and is a feature of most tax treaties.  The "280 day" test ensures that people with a consistent physical presence in the State are treated as being resident.  As the Commission on Taxation pointed out, even if the number of days of presence to become tax resident was reduced, individuals could still manage their affairs so as not to be present in the State to avoid becoming resident.A reduction in the number of days of presence to become resident would increase the possibility that individuals who were not trying to manipulate the day counting rules — for example, those working here on short term contracts — would be resident both in Ireland and their home country in a tax year.  If certain income was taxable in both countries, they might be required to apply for relief under a Double Taxation Agreement.  A change such as is suggested might therefore lead to additional administrative burdens for no extra tax yield, could deter individuals from moving to Ireland for work, and affect our ability to maintain and expand our tax treaty network.For these reasons, I have no plans at this time to change the current day counting tests.  As with all areas of taxation, the tax residence provisions are constantly kept under review and any changes will be determined in the context of Budget and Finance Bill.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	498	The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for the timely collection and recovery of a range of taxes and duties due to the Exchequer.  I know that Revenue has a clear focus on making sure that every person and business complies with the requirement to file the relevant returns and to pay the appropriate tax or duty on a timely basis.  That is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse.In that regard Revenue provides a range of supports and services to individuals, businesses, tax practitioners and agents to facilitate and support a voluntary compliance culture.  Where timely compliance is not forthcoming then in accordance with the powers and sanctions provided to Revenue by the Oireachtas, a range of sanctions can be applied by Revenue such as, for example, charging of interest on late payment of taxes and duties or the application and collection of penalties for failure to file returns on time.  Interest on late payment of tax operates not only as a compensation for the Exchequer for the late payment of monies due to it but also as an essential support for timely voluntary compliance by ensuring a level playing field between those who meet their obligations on time and those who pay late or who may attempt not to pay at all.Penalties for the late or non-filing of returns is recognition, for example, of the importance of compliance with an essential tenet of the self-assessment system i.e. that you file your return on time with Revenue.  It underpins the voluntary compliance culture that is a welcome feature of the behaviour of the vast majority of individuals and businesses in this country.  On the matter of businesses deciding to wind up, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in their experience the marginal cost of interest or penalties is not a determining factor in the decision.I know, however, that Revenue is conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate that prevails and how this can pose challenges for business and individuals in being timely compliant.  Revenue responded to the difficult environment by actively encouraging businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise to find an agreed way through those difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.  Revenue has, for example, published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties on its website at www.revenue.ie.  I commend Revenue for the work that it has done in that regard and in the practical support and assistance it is providing to viable businesses.  I am aware that tax practitioners and representative bodies have recognised the Revenue efforts in this regard also.Overall I am satisfied that the current regime of interest and penalty sanctions for late filing of returns and late payment of tax and duty achieves the correct balance in supporting timely compliance and securing the monies due to the Exchequer on a timely basis.  I am satisfied that Revenue's actions in the charging and collection of interest and in the application of penalties for failure to file returns are reasonable having regard to the importance of timely compliance and the need to ensure a level competitive playing field across businesses and individuals.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The Universal Social Charge (USC) is an individualised charge and as such the yields are calculated for individual incomes of more than €100,000, €125,000 and €150,000 rather than dual incomes of more than €200,000, €250,000 and €300,000.  In addition, it is assumed that the Deputy proposes to create two new top rates of USC which would be 8% for PAYE income earners and 11% for self employed income earners on individual incomes of €100,000, €125,000 and €150,000.On that basis, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, of creating the proposed new rates of USC for incomes over €100,000, €125,000 and €150,000 respectively would be of the order of €70 million, €55 million and €50 million respectively.  These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2012. They are therefore provisional and may be revised.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I assume the measure to which the Deputy refers is the Domicile Levy announced in Budget 2010 and introduced in Finance Act 2010.  The Deputy will be aware that a Domicile Levy of €200,000 is charged on an individual who is Irish-domiciled and an Irish citizen whose worldwide income exceeds €1m, whose Irish located property is greater than €5m, and whose liability to Irish income tax was less than €200,000.Where a person liable to pay the levy has paid income tax, s/he will be entitled to a credit for the tax paid in calculating the amount of the levy. The levy applies to both resident and non-resident individuals who meet the above criteria.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the first valuation date for the Domicile Levy was 31 December 2010 and the tax return and payment of the Domicile Levy for 2010 was due on 16 November 2011.  As of today, ten returns have been received in relation to the Domicile Levy for 2010.  The tax paid in relation to these ten returns was €1,479,813.It is not possible to estimate the full amount of revenue that may be raised from the Domicile Levy into the future.  As the "Pay and File" deadline date and the deadline date for payment via Revenue On-line Services (ROS) have passed, no further yield from the Domicile Levy for the 2010 tax year is expected in 2011, unless a late return is received.To date the Domicile Levy has affected seven non-resident individuals. Many non-resident individuals who file Irish tax returns would not be subject to the levy, either because they are not Irish citizens, they have a foreign domicile, or their worldwide income or the value of their Irish located property are below the threshold amounts shown above.  In 2009, some 8,493 Irish income tax returns showed one or both spouses as non-resident.  The equivalent figures for 2010 are not yet available.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	502	Neither the Central Bank nor I, as Minister for Finance, have a statutory role in the setting of interest rates charged or paid by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank.  Based on the recent advice received from the Central Bank, I have no plans to recommend to Government that legislation be introduced to compel lenders to reduce their standard variable rates. The question of how interest rates paid on deposits should be treated would also have to be considered in the context of such legislation. However, I will keep the matter under review.The Central Bank have informed me that, using their existing powers,  they will engage with lenders which appear to have standard variable mortgage rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds. Credit institutions are not primarily or always funded from the ECB, but rather from a number of sources.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	503	The Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) is the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 to prevent over-funding of pensions through tax-relieved arrangements. The SFT was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 by over 50% to a level of €2.3 million with effect from 7 December 2010 with transitional arrangements to protect the capital values of the pension rights of individuals where these exceeded the reduced SFT on that date.   There is currently no underlying data available to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners on which to base reliable estimates of the savings from a further reduction in the SFT to the level indicated in the question.Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements. For these reasons, the estimated savings included in respect the Budget and Finance Act 2011 change in the SFT were quite conservative, based as they were, on incomplete data and using very broad assumptions.My Department has been engaging with representatives of the pensions industry with a view, among other things, to gathering private pensions-related data which may be of value into the future in estimating the costs of potential changes in the pensions' tax area. These engagements are ongoing.

This estimate does not take into account any behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such a measure.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year cost to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, of increasing the existing exemption threshold of €4,004 per annum for the Universal Social Charge (USC) to €15,000 per annum would be €120 million.  These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2012.  They are therefore provisional and may be revised.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as medical cardholders are not generally separately identified on tax records there is no statistical basis on which an estimate of the cost of exempting medical cardholders from the USC could be compiled.  However, based on information derived from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) conducted by the Central Statistics Office, it is tentatively estimated that the full year cost to the Exchequer of exempting medical card holders from the USC would be €175 million in 2012 and €245 million from 2015 when the transitional concession ceases.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	506	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the 2010 "Study on Interest Rate Restrictions in the EU (Final Report) (Ref. No. ETD/2009/IM/H3/87)" which followed wide consultation with Member States and is available on the European Commission website.  It should be noted that the views expressed in the study are the views of the consultants who drafted the study and not those of the European Commission.The Study, which runs to over 400 pages, provides the European Commission with an overview of the many types of interest rate restrictions that exist in EU member states and assesses the relevance of such restrictions.  Importantly it concludes that interest rate restrictions, where they are applied, do not affect ordinary mortgage loans because actual rates are usually far removed from the interest rate ceilings set, and also that interest rate restrictions can affect the supply of credit, as recently pointed out by the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank.  I understand that the Study's findings will be taken into account by the European Commission if developing any future position on interest rate restrictions.  Neither the Central Bank nor I, as Minister for Finance, have a statutory role in the setting of interest rates charged or paid by financial institutions in Ireland regulated by the Central Bank.In a recent letter to the Taoiseach, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank stated that the power to exercise close regulatory control over retail interest rates is not sought by the Central Bank at this time.  The Deputy Governor goes on to point out the difficulties which would result from Central Bank powers to set interest rates.  These include a reduction in the availability of credit particularly to less secure customers, a chilling effect on entry of sound competitors in the market and an impediment to progress towards the re-establishment of bank management practices that could ensure a healthy and free standing banking system no longer dependent on the Government for bail outs.Based on the advice received from the Central Bank I have no plans to recommend to Government that they introduce legislation to compel lenders to reduce their standard variable rates.  However, I will keep the matter under review.

The directed portfolio (the part of the Fund which is managed by the Commission on foot of directions from the Minister for Finance) was valued at €9.6 billion, while the discretionary portfolio, the investment of which remains the Commission's responsibility, was valued at €5.3 billion at 30 September 2011.   The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) Commission publishes a performance and portfolio update quarterly on the NPRF website www.nprf.ie. The value and asset allocation of the discretionary portfolio as at 30 September 2011 as published on the website is as follows:    Asset Class€m% of Discretionary PortfolioLarge Cap Equity1,04719.8%Small Cap Equity1142.2%Emerging Markets Equity3346.3%Quoted Equity1,49528.3%Eurozone Government Bonds00.0%Eurozone Inflation-linked Bonds631.2%Eurozone Corporate Bonds2755.2%Cash1,01819.3%Financial Assets1,35625.7%Private Equity88816.8%Property5109.7%Commodities2134.0%Forestry300.6%Infrastructure2755.2%Absolute Return Funds1883.6%Alternative Assets2,10439.8%Value of equity market protection (put options)3286.2%Total Discretionary Portfolio5,283100%I am informed by the NTMA as Manager of the Fund that all the discretionary portfolio investments in quoted equity, financial assets and the equity market put options can be accessed relatively quickly — generally within a period of between one and three weeks.  As regards the investments in alternative assets —(i) the investments in commodities are held through investment funds which can be cashed in at any time,(ii) the absolute return investments are held through investment funds which can generally be sold within a month,(iii) the investments in infrastructure are listed securities which can generally be accessed within a period of between one and three weeks, and(iv) the investments in forestry, private equity and property, with a total value of €1,428 million, are illiquid.In addition, I understand that the NPRF has (i) outstanding commitments to invest further monies in private equity, property and infrastructure funds totalling some €950 million, of which €420 million is to Innovation Fund Ireland, the Irish Infrastructure Trust and other Irish venture capital funds, and (ii) contracted sales of some €160 million that are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2011.  The effect of these two factors is to increase the amount of illiquid assets by approximately €790 million.  Drawdown of committed monies on a phased basis is a normal feature of investment in such funds.  Other than in the case of Irish-based investments, these outstanding commitments were all made in the period 2005 to 2008.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on information regarding the cost of the Mid-Shannon Scheme, which has been received and collated for the tax year 2009, the latest year for which data is available, the annual yield to the Exchequer from the abolition of this relief could be in the region of €0.2 million.  The Palliative Care Units Scheme was not commenced.All other such schemes have been terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for certain schemes where projects were already in the pipeline.  However, due to their nature these reliefs continue to entail ongoing costs on the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information provided in tax returns on the annual amounts of claims for property based tax reliefs is not sufficiently detailed to provide a basis for deriving an estimate of the remaining legacy cost to the Exchequer.  I am not therefore in a position to provide the information requested by the Deputy related to savings.  The estimated annual cost to the Exchequer of all "legacy" property-related tax schemes in 2009 was €341.8m.As the Deputy will be aware an economic impact assessment of potential changes to the "legacy" property-based tax relief schemes is currently underway.  This assessment includes an examination of the benefits that may accrue to the Exchequer in terms of additional tax yield from restrictions to the reliefs.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a number of studies have been undertaken in the last few years to determine the level of cross-border shopping and how much this affects Exchequer revenue.  The Report on the Implications of Cross Border Shopping, which was undertaken on behalf of the Minister for Finance by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office, was published in March 2009.  This was followed on 4 December 2009 by the results of a survey of cross-border shopping as part of the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) conducted in Quarter 2, 2009.  On 12 November 2010, the results of the QNHS cross-border shopping survey for the year to Quarter 2, 2010 were released.The report undertaken by Revenue and the CSO estimates the value of cross-border shopping in 2008 in the range of €350m to €550m and the potential loss in VAT and excise revenues at between €58m and €90m (for reference, the higher estimate represents 0.4% of the total VAT and 0.6% of excise revenue in 2008).  In addition to the VAT and excise loss, there is a possible corporation tax revenue loss that is tentatively estimated to be in the range of €15m to €24m. However, it should be noted that all estimates for corporation tax revenue should only be considered as indicative of the potential loss given the difficulties in calculating a figure for the direct impact of cross border shopping on such activities.Total household expenditure on cross border shopping in Northern Ireland between Quarter 2 2008 and Quarter 2 2009 was estimated at €435 million.  The combined VAT and excise revenue loss is estimated at €63m and a possible corporation tax revenue loss in the range of €19m.The results of the most recent report for Q2 2010 indicate that 14% of households in the Republic made a shopping trip to Northern Ireland in the twelve months to Q2 2010, compared to 16% in the previous year.  While there was an increase in cross border shopping in the border area from 41% to 43% over the year; there was a marked decrease in shopping activity by people from Dublin, where 15% made a shopping trip in 2010, compared with 21% in 2009.The QNHS also showed that the majority of trips involved purchases of groceries, alcohol, clothing and durables, similar to the previous year.  The report estimated that the total expenditure in the year to Q2 2010 on cross border shopping trips at €418 million, reduced slightly from €435 million in the previous year.  Based on the data contained in the survey, Revenue has estimated that the VAT, Excise and Corporation Tax losses in this period due to cross border shopping was in the region of €80 million, a similar level to the €81 million the previous year and suggesting that the level of cross border shopping had stabilised.The statistics in the QNHS Reports were broadly in line with the results of the March 2009 Report on the Implications of Cross Border Shopping, which noted that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic were operating costs, profit margin (mark-up), taxes and a significant depreciation of Sterling against the Euro.  While variations in the VAT rates widened some price differentials, their impact remained small compared to the significance of the change in the exchange rate.

In general, the amount of VAT and other taxes collected from internet trading is not separately identifiable as businesses are obliged to calculate and return VAT and other taxes by reference to their entire taxable activities, which includes both traditional forms of business and internet sales.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioner, who are responsible for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in fuel products that they are aware of the threat to the Exchequer posed by laundered fuel.  The predominant illicit activity in the mineral oil area in both Northern Ireland and the Republic is the laundering of marked diesel and its sale through illegal outlets.  In both jurisdictions the respective difference in excise rates between marked (rebated) and normal diesel offers a considerable incentive for oil laundering and this illicit activity poses a serious threat to the Exchequer and the economy on both sides of the border.The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to accurately estimate the loss to the national exchequer from individual activities within the shadow economy such as fuel laundering.  Revenue employs a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies to detect and counteract illegal practices involving mineral oils.  These include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem; development and sharing of intelligence with agencies on both sides of the border; the conduct of intelligence driven operations using covert surveillance to identify oil laundry locations; seizure of illicit product, laundering equipment and vehicles; physical sampling at road checkpoints; closure of unlicensed or improperly licensed outlets and seizure of stock and prosecution of those involved in illegal activities in relation to mineral oils.So far this year, nine oil laundries have been detected, together with 327,000 litres of laundered fuel, and nine oil tankers and twenty-nine other vehicles have been seized.  Sixteen persons were arrested in the course of these operations and files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has to date issued directions to prosecute on indictment in respect of two of these cases. The Deputy will appreciate that there is some time-span between the detection of an offence and the appearance of a defendant before the courts.  So far in 2011, in addition to the 327,000 litres of fuel seized in the course of raids on oil laundries, a further 516,270 litres of illicit mineral oil has been seized, the large majority from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets.  Revenue has obtained two convictions in the courts this year against the proprietors of filling stations that were found to be selling laundered mineral oil as auto diesel.Revenue is currently engaged in a vigorous campaign targeting specific locations nationwide, with the intention of immediate closure of unlicensed outlets and the challenging of other instances of non-compliance.  As part of this drive, warning letters have been issued to unlicensed retail outlets and a number of these have been effectively closed down by the actions of Revenue enforcement teams.  This campaign is ongoing and Revenue is in the process of seizing illicit product and closing down a further number of unlicensed or otherwise illegal retail outlets.  This month alone, in a recent targeted enforcement operation by Revenue officers, ten filling stations, one fuel depot and two private dwellings in counties Dublin, Galway and Louth were raided.  A total of 158,000 litres of fuel were seized from three of these premises, including two tankers of fuel, and approximately €39,000 was detained under the Proceeds of Crime legislation.Revenue is also reviewing the effectiveness of legislation and regulations in relation to combating the illicit trade in mineral oil and I expect to bring forward proposals to strengthen controls in relation to mineral oils in the context of the next Finance Bill.  I am also pleased that Revenue is receiving very good cooperation from the major oil distributors in the State and from the Irish Petrol Retailers Association, which represents the majority of legitimate retail outlets, in their efforts to counteract the threat posed by the sale and distribution of illicit mineral oil.

This includes reviewing powers, penalties, etc, and making recommendations to my Department where legislative amendments are required.  The ongoing review of effectiveness includes consideration of alternative approaches, as referred to by the Deputy, to tackling the illicit removal of fuel marker.General consideration has been given, in this context, to a rebate system. However, Revenue advises me that such a system would pose different problems.  It would involve the establishment of a very extensive repayment system, giving rise to a very significant administrative burden for oil traders, consumers and for Revenue and would pose significant cash-flow difficulties for those who currently use marked gas oil.  Repayment regimes are vulnerable to abuse and liable to be exploited by criminal elements, such as those currently involved in fuel laundering.

As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10th November 2011, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years. Given the constraints on capital funding, the Government has to prioritise school building projects and the very real need to ensure that every child has access to a school place. It is unlikely, therefore, that funding will be available for the works referred to by the Deputy in the foreseeable future.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	521	As the Deputy will be aware, the reality of our economic situation presents significant challenges that have to be reconciled with limitations on public resources. This is a very stark reality, which, unfortunately, means that changes to any public service provision, including the student grant scheme, cannot be ruled out.I empathise with students and I am very conscious of the played by the student grant scheme in supporting families who are putting their children through further and higher education. However, the state of the public finances is such that tough decisions have to be made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. For this reason it is the responsibility of Government to take into consideration all areas of public service provision when formulating Budget 2012. Ultimately, our budgetary decisions now will play a major part in creating a sustainable economy and in regaining our economic independence. I will take the concerns of students into consideration during the budgetary process in this context and I will try to protect, to the greatest extent possible, the most disadvantaged students in further and higher education.

The matter of parking on public roads does not come within the remit of my Department and is appropriate to the relevant Local Authority. The position relating to a school subsidising staff parking on public roads from within its own resources is a matter for the individual school authority.

These measures will be confined to teachers teaching State examination classes in post-primary schools and do not apply to teachers with no exam classes or to primary school teachers.Post-primary schools may re-employ teachers who retire between 1 December 2011 and 29 February 2012 and who, immediately before their retirement, have been teaching students preparing to sit the Junior or Leaving Certificate examinations in 2012.  These teachers may be re-employed until the summer holidays for the teaching duties for which they were timetabled immediately before their retirement.  Where a teacher's pre-retirement duties included both teaching and non-teaching duties, such as in the case of an Assistant Principal or Deputy Principal, the teacher may be re-employed for his or her teaching hours only.  There is no additional cost of this measure.  Those teachers who have retired would, in any event, receive their pension and lump sum.  In the event that retired teachers were not re-employed for classes preparing for the Junior and Leaving Certificate then other teachers would be recruited to fill these teaching hours.  Those retired teachers re-employed until the end of the teaching year will be paid at the reduced rate applicable to post Jan-2011 new entrant teachers.I am aware that there are a large number of qualified and registered teachers who are unable to source work at the current time.  I am also very alive to the pressures our young people are under to perform well in their State exams.  I believe that the approach being adopted strikes the right balance between the needs of students who face into significant examinations, the retiring teachers who have invested a huge amount of time and effort in preparing students for their examinations and those teachers who are looking forward to the opportunities presented by the increased level of retirements at a time of constrained resources.

The legislative proposals followed extensive consultations with survivors of residential abuse and the groups which support them, together with a public consultation process. In this context, the report on the consultation process and the General Scheme of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill were published on my Department's website.Some former residents advocated a simple distribution of the available money rather than the establishment of the Statutory Fund. However, as I outlined when I published the legislative proposals, I believe that the Fund should target resources at services to support former residents' needs. The General Scheme outlines the range of services proposed.I had a very constructive meeting with groups representing survivors of residential institutional abuse on 22nd July last, when we discussed the Government's approach to the proposed Statutory Fund. Attendees at that meeting raised a number of issues regarding aspects of the proposed approach as set out in the General Scheme of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill. I have also received a number of submissions from groups and individuals in relation to the proposed legislation. Work is progressing on the drafting of the Bill and the various views expressed to date are being considered as the drafting process continues.

Fee-charging schools do not receive capitation grants or related supports.  The only current funding provided to fee-charging schools by my Department in 2011 is the Assistive Technology grant for students with particular special educational needs. Almost €22,000 was paid to fee-charging schools in respect of this grant to date this year (as at 21 November 2011).  The total amount of capital funding provided to fee-charging schools this year, up to 21 November, is €2.15m. It must be noted that this is just over 0.4% of the entire capital budget for education in 2011.In addition to this funding, teachers employed within the approved annual staffing allocation granted by my Department in fee-charging schools are paid by the State; an arrangement that predates the introduction of free education arrangements and which has existed since the foundation of the State. The estimated cost of these posts in 2011 is in the order of €100m. I am already on record as saying that this is not a simple matter as these arrangements, which are historic and of long standing, impact upon a substantial number of schools which cater for religious minorities.

The NCSE has advised my Department that, irrespective of the assessed levels of ability of the child, there are schools placements available for this child. I also understand from my officials that the parents of this child have been advised of their placement options by the NCSE. It is now a matter for the parents of the child concerned to engage with the schools in question and to apply to have their child enrolled to a school.The purpose of the Home Tuition Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who are unable to attend school for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, or for whom there are no available placements.  Home tuition was approved for the child in question by my Department from the start of the school year until the end of September 2011 as there was no available placement. Home Tuition was subsequently extended until 14th October 2011, for the purpose of completing the enrolment process. My Department may consider whether there is a requirement to extending this period further to facilitate transitional arrangements, as an exceptional measure, once a school based placement has been accepted by the parents.

This practice note sets out the duties of the Contractor and the Employer’s Representative (usually the Project Architect) under the relevant contract used for individual school building projects.  Where complaints regarding compliance with employment rights legislation arise, the appropriate statutory body for investigating such complaints is the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA). Its remit includes both inspection and enforcement (and prosecution) services. NERA’s website is http://www.employmentrights.ie.The Deputy may be interested to know that I have asked the relevant officials in my Department to discuss a proposal suggested by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which may lead to a higher level of compliance on all school building projects funded by the state. Discussions on this will continue in the coming period.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	534	It is understood that the Deputy's question refers to my Department's policy on the education of children with autism. My Department's policy is centred on an inclusive approach promoting the use of a range of autism specific interventions including TEACCH, PECs and Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA).  Under this approach, each child can benefit from a number of different interventions to ensure the optimum individualised educational programme for him/her. Educational intervention for children with ASD needs to be child-centred and tailored to meet the needs of each child, rather than matching the needs of a child to one particular or exclusive intervention.In arriving at the preferred policy which is currently in place, my Department has considered published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001) and the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (2006), both of which are available on my Department's website and have informed the policy. My Department was also mindful of contributions of many other experts at international conferences/visits which have also informed the development views.  It is not possible to exhaustively list all of the contributions and contributors who have informed and influenced the Department of Education and Skills position on educational provision for children with autism.The report of the Task Force on Autism and the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (2006), describes Applied Behavioural Analysis as an approach and contains significant and comprehensive commentary on this approach. I see no reason to call this description of Applied Behavioural Analysis into question.

The relevant councils also brought the works through the planning process. The final element to the scheme is being implemented by Fingal County Council with the replacement of a bridge in Mulhuddart.  Maintenance of the channel in the area referred to by the Deputy is currently a matter for Dublin City Council. OPW is not aware of any particular location in that area where maintenance would be required.The views of local residents will be taken fully into consideration in preparing plans for the management of coastal flood risk. This will be done within the Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, which will initially identify areas of potential significant risk of coastal flooding and for possible further assessment. Management plans will be prepared on a catchment basis, including coastal areas, which will outline the appropriate measures to best manage the coastal flood risk. Draft management plans will be subject to public consultation and Strategic Environmental Assessment will also be undertaken in respect of the proposed measures.OPW has appointed engineering consultants to 5 of the 6 river basin districts and the final one is at tender stage. OPW expects to make the final appointment in the coming weeks. It is expected that a public consultation on the Eastern area CFRAM will take place early in 2012.  Further public consultation will also be necessary under the existing Environmental Impact Assessment, Planning or Exhibition Processes prior to detailed design stage.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	536	The previous three budgets cover the period from the Supplementary Budget in April 2009 to Budget 2011 which was announced in December last. Significant reductions have been effected to the pay, expenses and pensions of Oireachtas members in the period and since the current Government took up Office.The pay rates of Oireachtas members have been reduced through the application of the Financial Emergency Measures Acts 2009. This legislation applied the pension related deduction with effect from March 2009 and the pay reduction from January 2010 to all public servants including members of the Oireachtas. This represented a cumulative reduction of 15% in respect of members of the Dáil and 13% for members of the Seanad. Also, under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009, the payment of Long Service Increments to members ceased with effect from the formation of the current Oireachtas.  The cost of allowances in the nature of pay paid to members in respect of parliamentary duties as Chairs of Oireachtas Committees, Party Whips, Members of the Oireachtas Commission etc. has been reduced by the Government in the current Oireachtas by some 50% from 2010.For senior Office Holders including An Taoiseach, Ministers, Ministers of State, Ceann Comhairle, and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the cumulative reductions in salaries including those announced by the Government on taking office, have resulted in significantly higher reductions ranging from 24% to 37%.In conjunction with the Oireachtas Commission a major reform of the system of expense allowances for Oireachtas members was made last year. The new system provided for a single, transparent and verifiable parliamentary allowance system to cover the parliamentary and representation costs of Deputies, Senators and Ministers.  This major reform carried through the reductions already imposed on Oireachtas members' expenses in 2009. The mileage allowance was reduced by 25% and other allowances were reduced by 10%.  New lower limits have also been set to the entitlement to prepaid envelopes for Members. This is now 1,250 envelopes per month for Deputies and 750 envelopes per month for Senators.In relation to pensions, a number of measures have been implemented. Following the recent General Election, members who are elected to either House may not be paid an office-holder pension while a sitting member.  This measure was provided for in the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009. The Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) applies to former members of the Oireachtas. In addition, the pay reductions applied to members' salaries since 2010 will impact on pension benefits for those retiring after the end of the ‘grace period', i.e. from March 2012 onwards.  Those retiring on pension before that date are subject to the PSPR.

I will bring proposals to Government later in the year in relation to these. These projects, detailed in the table, include those where temporary accommodation was provided for advance parties of various sizes pending permanent accommodation for the entire project; those with permanent accommodation that now face the prospect of significant staffing shortfalls due to the change in the staffing outlook; and some that have business/operational effectiveness issues that require further consideration.The review of the 17 advance party projects, including the one currently at Tubbercurry (for Charlestown), will take account of property and cost issues; the possibilities for integration with other regional or national offices; staffing and IR issues; and any business, operational effectiveness and related considerations that pertain, including any proposals to curtail and close down programmes and agencies.The majority of advance party projects were decentralised as viable/stand alone units and moved in accordance with detailed implementation plans. In the event that any significant changes to individual projects are necessary in the light of the review, my Department will work through the implications of any decision, in consultation with decentralising organisations, and the unions as appropriate.LocationAdvance PartiesTotal Posts due to decentraliseStaff moved to organisation at end January 2011AthyOffice of Revenue Commissioners  (Advance Party)25373BirrFÁS (Advance Party)39820CarlowJobs Enterprise and Innovation (Advance Party)257103CavanCommunications Energy & Natural Resources (Advance Party)30157Claremorris (Phase I)Office of Public Works (Advance Party)10431ClifdenPobal (Advance Party)4225DundalkSustainable Energy Ireland (Advance Party)3411PortarlingtonData Protection Commissioner (Advance Party)2323Portlaoise (for Portarlington)Equality Tribunal (civil service) (Advance Party)428Portlaoise (for Portarlington)NCCA (civil service) (Advance Party)3712PortlaoiseAgriculture Food and the Marine (Advance Party)595317RoscreaEquality Authority (civil service) (Advance Party)4116ShannonEnterprise Ireland (Advance Party)29266Tipperary TownJustice & Equality (INIS) (Advance Party)18663ThomastownHealth & Safety Authority (Advance Party)11633ThurlesGarda Headquarters CGVU & FCPS (Advance Party)199133Tubbercurry (for Charlestown)Environment Community and Local Government (Advance Party)16410017 Projects2,8981,091LocationAdvance PartiesTotal Posts due to decentraliseStaff moved to organisation at end January 2011CurraghDefence Forces4130Clonakilty**BIM9020LimerickDevelopment Cooperation, Foreign Affairs & Trade134134Newbridge ***Department of Defence201165RoscommonProperty Registration Authority230775   Projects1,068396Overall Total                                          22   Projects3,9661,487*The projects to be reviewed include some where permanent accommodation has been provided but where there are staffing shortfalls or business/operational effectiveness issues that require consideration.**The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (47 staff) were subsequently allocated some of the space provided for BIM.***To review HQ designation only.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	538	You will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies.  In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Mr Brian Hayes has been working with Senator Quinn to develop the Construction Contracts Bill, which is now before the Dáil, into a robust piece of legislation.  In order to address a number of issues that were raised during the consultation on the Bill a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was carried out. The RIA was completed and published on 27 September.  The Report is available on my Department's website: www.per.gov.ie/reports.
The RIA examined issues relating to payment practices in the construction sector and assessed the need for legislative intervention.  It found that legislation is desirable to improve payment practices and to allow swift resolution of payment disputes by way of adjudication, allowing projects to be completed without wasting time and money in litigation.  In addition, the RIA examined the main proposals to amend the Bill that were raised during the Seanad debate and subsequent consultation.  It found that there were merits to considering amending the Bill in a number of respects e.g. to bring lower value contracts within its scope and to make the adjudicators award binding in payment dispute cases.  It concluded that any such amendments should be formulated in such a manner that would protect the taxpayer.Minister Hayes is now reflecting on the findings of the RIA and is preparing legislative proposals which will be brought to Government shortly for approval.  It is essential that the solution to this issue needs to be balanced so as to avoid imposing regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	541	The Office of Public Works constantly benchmarks the rent it pays against rent paid for similar buildings in the private sector.  Property consultants CBRE were commissioned in 2008 to benchmark OPW rental performance against market outcomes.  The consultants found that overall, OPW are achieving comparable value for money.  OPW has adopted a twin track approach to reducing the annual rent bill:(a) rationalisation of the leasehold portfolio through targeted surrenders of leases and (b) pro-active pursuit of reductions at rent reviews, notwithstanding "upward only" review provisions in leases.Under the property rationalisation programme, leases surrendered in 2010 resulted in a reduction of €8.75 million in annual rental value.  Leases surrendered so far this year will achieve an annual rental value saving of €3.17million.  Rent reductions in 2010-2011 to date, achieved by negotiation, reduced the annual rental bill by a further €2.75 million.  The rent reduction strategy and the property rationalisation programme will continue to be rolled out in the next 3 years and will be regularly reviewed and adjusted to achieve maximum savings in the annual rental bill.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The radical streamlining of state bodies is a key deliverable of the Government's Reform Programme and will, I believe, lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.  It should not be viewed solely as a costs saving exercise.  The Government believes that real benefit will come from a less crowded administrative landscape resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for citizens.  As set out in the published documents the direct savings likely to accrue from the rationalisation of State Bodies are estimated at about €20 million.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The estimates allocation and overall budgetary process will set out the approach to be taken to Government expenditure.  This framework does not assign specific savings targets to those areas that are covered by the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.  However, the Agreement provides for an annual review of the savings generated from its implementation.  The first such review undertaken by the Implementation Body, which was published in June 2011, established that sustainable Exchequer pay bill savings of €289m had been achieved during the first year of the Agreement (i.e. the 12 months to end March 2011), driven primarily by the reduction in public service numbers of 5,349 over that period.  The Body’s report also provided evidence of significant non-pay savings achieved across the public service over the review period.  Further reports will be published by the Implementation Body on an annual basis.The Government's new Public Service Reform Plan announced on 17th November last provides for reducing the total number of Public Service employees by some 23,500 by 2015 compared to the total number at the end of 2010.  In 2011, it is expected a further reduction of some 5,000 in staff numbers across the Public Service to bring the numbers below 300,000 (whole time equivalents) by the end of 2011.  New high level targets for each sector in respect of 2012 will be set out at Budget time.  In total, it is expected that by 2015, Public Service numbers are expected to have fallen by 37,500 since 2008 (a reduction of almost 12%).  When delivered, this will have reduced the gross pay bill by over €2.5 billion (or 15%) since 2008.This reduction excludes the effect of the pension related deduction on the exchequer paybill which gives rise to a further saving of some €900m on an annual basis.  The public service number reductions are expected to be achieved through retirements and restrictions on recruitment except where existing exit mechanisms apply.  The Croke Park Agreement provides the framework within which these reductions can be made and is a key enabler of the Government's public service reform programme.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21438	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	546	The role of my Department is to drive Ireland's competitiveness and productivity by creating the conditions where enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation can flourish and quality employment opportunities are grown and maintained.  Funding is provided to a number of State Agencies under its aegis including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.The role of the CEBs is to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at a local level primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small and micro-enterprises.  The Boards form a nationwide support network for small business and are considered to be a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in businessWhile my Department provides funding to the CEBs neither I nor my Department officials have any role or function in the day-to-day decision making activities of the Boards.  The CEBs are independent companies, limited by guarantee and therefore legal entities in their own right.  Decisions on applications for assistance from the CEBs are made independently by the Boards, subject to eligibility criteria, on the advice of their evaluation committees, and any person wishing to consider starting up a business is therefore advised to contact their local CEB in the first instance.Contact details for each of the CEBs is available on their national website www.enterpriseboards.ie.  The Dublin 5 area falls within the catchment area of Dublin City Enterprise Board, 5th Floor, O’Connell Bridge House, D’Olier Street, Dublin 2, phone 01-6351144, email gswift@dceb.ie, website www.dceb.ie.  In addition to the supports and services of the state agencies under the aegis of my Department, the promoter may also wish to be made aware that the Department of Social Protection also provides assistance through various Back to Work (Enterprise) Schemes and an Employer (PRSI) Incentive Scheme.In addition and subject to certain eligibility criteria, persons returning to the workplace (having been unemployed for over a year) may be able to avail of Revenue's Job Assist.  In this regard, the promoter may wish to contact the Departments of Social Protection at www.welfare.ie and Revenue at www.revenue.ie for further information.With regard to internship placements, my Department participates in the "JobBridge National Internship Scheme" that provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period.  Currently, my Department has no positions advertised, however positions will be advertised in line with business demands and therefore I would advise that interested persons regularly view the JobBridge website www.jobbridge.ie  for details of placements as they arise across a variety of organisations.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14232	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	547	While the areas around which public R&D budgets have been oriented to date (ICT, biotechnology, aspects of energy policy) were appropriate for building a broad base of national expertise in fundamental, underpinning science and technology we now need to leverage the strengths that have emerged from the investment that has taken place.  We need to target investment so that we have critical mass in areas that link more precisely to sustaining or growing jobs.The recommendations of the independently constituted Research Prioritisation Steering Group, chaired by Jim O'Hara, former General Manager, Intel Ireland, will be key in implementing efficiency and effectiveness in our system of public investment in R&D, and this will be complemented by other initiatives, notably the forthcoming legislation to extend the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to enable it to fund applied research.The report of the Research Prioritisation Group has been completed and submitted to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and myself and will shortly be brought to Government for consideration.  Future focus of investment on the priority areas identified will require greater cohesion of funding across Departments and agencies.  Achieving this cohesion is likely to be more impactful than a single funding stream per se.

This is as a result of Ireland's being part of a single European Labour Market. Any costs involved in the promotion of these vacancies are paid by way of grant from the European Commission.With regard to non EU/EEA jobs and specifically in relation to the Canadian Job Fair held in Dublin on 12th and 13th November and Cork on the 8th November, FÁS (International Employment Services) were asked by the Governments of the Canadian Provinces of Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Islands and Labrador to assist the Irish Canadian Business Association with their organisation of these Job Fairs. They were anxious that Irish jobseekers going to Canada had the full facts of the Canadian visa requirements, full information on the recognition of their qualifications and were making the right decision for themselves and their families.The Fair was attended by the Immigration Departments of the above Provinces who offered help and assistance with the immigration and visa process in addition to representing many Canadian employers with well paid opportunities. The Fair was also attended by almost 20 Canadian companies who wished to recruit directly.

Notwithstanding the positions of the Department in rejecting that liability for these costs falls to be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department, and the unions representing CE supervisors.In the event that funding was required from FÁS, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of €3m with retrospective costs of the order of at least €30m.  The Deputy should also note that FÁS is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.  Neither was FÁS a party to the Labour Court dispute on this matter.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.

The extent to which employers are liable varies significantly — for example two years in the Netherlands, twenty eight weeks in the UK and 9 days in Finland.  The specific manner in which such schemes operate — in terms of coverage, payment rates, compensation for certain employers and so on also vary considerably.  A preliminary analysis based on estimates of absenteeism indicates that if a sick pay scheme with a duration of four weeks were to be introduced, it would add between €1-2 per employee per week to the costs of employment.

The statutory role of the Board is to monitor and supervise the operation of the Pensions Act 1990.

The McCarthy report also recommended the amalgamation of both agencies and a review was carried out at that time which concluded that such an amalgamation should not take place due to the crisis in the pensions and financial sectors and the limited savings which would accrue. My Department undertook to re-examine the feasibility of amalgamating both agencies in 2012. This review will take place within the required timescale.It should be noted that the Pensions Board is funded by levies on pension schemes. Therefore, there would not be financial savings accruing to the Exchequer. However, until the review takes place, it is not possible to quantify if there are other efficiency gains to be achieved from such an amalgamation.

A number of planning authorities, representing a broad geographical spread of both urban and rural areas as well as both large and small authorities, had been selected to assist in the review of policies and practices by reference to a number of cases raised with my Department.The Programme for Government includes, inter alia , specific commitments better to co-ordinate national, regional and local planning laws in order to achieve better and more co-ordinated development that supports local communities, to develop a coherent plan to deal with the issue of unfinished estates and to ensure that there is adequate access and participation by citizens and public representatives in decision making and policy formation.  The resources of my Department will be directed primarily towards supporting the implementation of the Government’s commitments in these areas.My Department is currently finalising the review of a number of specific complaints, following the initiating of the process by the former Minister Mr. John Gormley.  When this review is completed, I will issue a public statement outlining the complaints at issue, my response and any appropriate actions to be pursued in regard to further policy development and guidance, in line with commitments in the Programme for Government.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	580	The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 provides the legislative basis for the €200 charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR), including the application of late payment fees.  The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property which is situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance and there is no obligation on local authorities, who levy and collect the charge, to issue notifications or invoices.Nationwide advertising took place in each year since the introduction of the charge in 2009 to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  In tandem, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally.  Some advertising on the charge was also placed in publications/newsletters circulating in areas in which large Irish populations are residing abroad.  Communications have also been issued to persons who paid the charge in respect of previous years reminding them of their possible liability for the charge.  Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and the liability dates.  However, the charge is based on self assessment principles and it is a matter for persons with a liability to pay the charge by the due date to avoid late payment fees.

However, I understand that the offices in question are currently in the process of being sold.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	582	The vision for the future of the housing sector in Ireland, as set in the Government's Housing Policy Statement published in June 2011, is based on choice, fairness, equity across tenures and on delivering quality outcomes for the resources invested.  The overall strategic objective will be to enable all households access good quality housing, appropriate to household circumstances and in their particular community of choice.The main focus in terms of housing supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs — the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources.  The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to very large capital-funded construction programmes by local authorities.The provision of sheltered housing is mainly funded through my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), which will continue to provide capital funding for the provision, by approved housing bodies, of housing to meet the accommodation needs of persons with specific categories of need, including older people, people with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability and homeless persons.  Given that individual approved housing bodies may cater for a range of special housing needs and considering that the accommodation provided by these bodies under the CAS may be multipurpose, it is not possible to disaggregate the expenditure figures to provide information in relation to any specific category such as sheltered housing.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	583	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to complete ratification of the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters.  The three pillars of the Convention are partially implemented in EU law by two Directives.  The first of these deals with public access to environmental information and was transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007.The second, known as the Public Participation Directive, deals with public participation in decision making and access to justice. Several pieces of legislation have been used to transpose the Public Participation Directive into law.  The most recent measure is the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, which introduced new cost rules that apply in certain environmental cases.  This Act also implements certain aspects of the Convention that are not implemented by EU Directives.The effect of these measures is that Ireland has now implemented the provisions of the Convention.  My Department is currently carrying out a final assessment of all implementation measures in co-operation with the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to ratifying the Convention during the first half of 2012.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	584	State aid refers to any aid granted by a Member State which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or goods.  EU Member States are required, under State Aid rules that originate in the Treaty of Rome, to submit a notification to DG Competition in the European Commission when they propose to provide state support for schemes and programmes that could be considered to distort competition in any way.  Commission Regulation EC 1998/2006 allows for aid of up to €200,000, known as de minimis aid, to be provided from public funds to enterprises over a period of three years as this amount is considered too small to have an effect on economic activity between competing forces.  In the original Rural Development Programme (RDP) document approved by the European Commission in July 2007, Ireland outlined that, as the aid to be granted under two of the Axis 3 measures of the RDP would not in any way distort competition, it would not constitute State Aid and would, therefore, not require notification to DG Competition.   The measures concerned, Basic services for the economy and rural population — €49.61m and Village renewal and development — €54.2m, provide support for non-commercial community based projects and focus particularly on community infrastructure.Recently Ireland was notified by the Commission that only DG Competition has the competence to judge whether or not state support can be deemed to be State Aid, and that a State Aid notification in the context of these two measures should have been submitted when the original programme was being prepared in 2006/2007.The notification process was not undertaken at the time of programme design and Ireland is now required to complete the notification process as soon as possible and obtain the necessary state aid clearance in order to proceed with projects requiring grant aid in excess of €200,000.  As the consequences of non-compliance with State Aid rules are significant, particularly for project promoters, it is necessary to suspend the allocation and approval of projects with grant amounts of over €200,000 in order to avoid non-compliance.I am aware of the importance of addressing this issue as soon as possible and my Department is in the process of submitting the necessary State Aid request to DG Competition.  As soon as the issue has been resolved we will notify all Local Development Companies.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	585	The task of ensuring efficient and effective provision of housing services by both housing authorities and approved housing bodies is an ongoing one.  On 16 June 2011 the Minister of State for Housing and Planning launched the Government's new housing policy statement which will serve as a framework for a sequence of legislative and policy initiatives in the short to medium-term building on new supply directions already initiated such as the social housing leasing initiative.  The new framework for housing policy responds to current and emerging conditions in the housing sector, taking account of the dramatic cycle of rapid growth and sudden collapse in the residential property market.We are committed to responding as quickly as possible, and on a larger scale, to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms including through increased provision of social housing by both local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.  In relation to efficiencies generally in the local government sector, the Local Government Efficiency Review Group, in its Report in July 2010, identified a number of efficiencies in the delivery of housing services.  I have established an Implementation Group to oversee the implementation of relevant recommendations from the Report.

Applicants are advised to make their application at least eight weeks in advance of the proposed date of travel.  It should however be borne in mind that the timeframe of eight weeks acts as a guideline only.  The actual timeframe for decision is ultimately dependent on a number of factors including inter alia  the number of applications on hand, the resources available to process them, the nature of the visa applied for and the degree of complication involved.  I can advise that each visa application is considered on its individual merits, the onus as always resting with the applicant to establish to the satisfaction of the Visa Officer as to why the visa sought should be granted.  The applicant will be notified of the decision as soon as it is made.Queries in relation to general immigration matters may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

It was refused by the Visa Officer on the 18 November 2011 for a number of reasons.  As is the case with all refused visa applications, the refusal decision and the reasons for that decision were sent by way of letter to the applicant.  It is open to the person concerned to submit an appeal within two months of the date of refusal, in this case before the 18 January 2012.  If doing so, the applicant would be advised to be in a position to address the concerns raised.   Guidelines on the visa appeals process are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).The Deputy may wish to note that in assessing any Visa application, the Visa Officer will consider various matters, including whether it is reasonable in the circumstances to conclude that the applicant would honour the conditions of the Visa and whether there is a significant risk that the applicant would overstay the period applied for.  The Visa Officer will also have regard to all of the information available to them and to such factors as the applicant's ties and general circumstances in their country of origin or where they are ordinarily and legally resident.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The Irish Prison Service provides a range of rehabilitative programmes which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging and equipping them to lead productive lives on release.   Several programmes and services have a specific post-release focus.The Prison Service funds the Gate Service operated by Business in the Community Ireland (BITC) which provides a training, education, and employment placement programme for prisoners and ex-prisoners.  The GATE Service operates in seven of the country's fourteen institutions.  The BITC Linkage Programme provides a similar service in the remaining institutions and operates in partnership with the Probation Service.  The BITC Mentoring Service which is jointly funded by the Prison Service and Dormant Accounts Funding is in place in Castlerea, Cork and the Training Unit.  Mentoring has been shown internationally to have a positive impact on the resettlement and desistance of ex-prisoners.Focus Ireland operates a pilot homeless service in Cloverhill Prison which supports remand prisoners in accessing appropriate services and accommodation on the pathway to independent living.  The project is supported by the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Homelessness support services are also provided in Cork and Limerick prisons.  A weekly clinic service is provided in ten prisons by the Health Service Executive Community Welfare Service through the Homeless Persons Unit (HPU).  Referrals generally are at the pre-release stage and Community Welfare Officers provide information and clinic services, and arrange emergency and other accommodation options, supplementary benefits and fast-tracked medical cards.The Prison Education Centres, staffed by Vocational Education Committee teachers, provide pre-release and post-release programmes aimed at assisting prisoner resettlement.  These are currently being reviewed as part of an ongoing comprehensive independent audit of prison education.  Prisoner resettlement is also an objective of the Prison Service's integrated sentence management system.  It is in operation in all prisons and seeks to provide integrated cross-disciplinary sentence management focused on the prisoner's resettlement from the moment of committal to release.

The position is unchanged since then. The reply stated:I am aware that there have been proposals of this nature and of course my Department will give due consideration to the issue.   However great caution should be exercised before embarking on such a project.  A proposal of this nature could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.At EU level,  the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008, made specific commitments "to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons".   While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among the Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual case.Any possible implication for the operation of the Common Travel Area would also have to be very carefully considered.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The Deputy may wish to note that information on the average cost of an available staffed prison space is contained in the Irish Prison Service Annual Report for 2010 and on the Prison Service's website www.irishprisons.ie.
The average cost of an available staffed prison space during the calendar year 2010 was €70,513 (€77,222 in 2009), a decrease on the 2009 cost of €6,709 or 8.7%.  The decrease in average cost is attributed to the following two factors:a decrease in total costs of €20.7 million; andan increase in bed capacity of 97 from 4,106 as at 31st December 2009 to an average bed capacity of  for 2010.Consistent with calculations in previous years, costs which are not under the direct control of the Irish Prison Service were excluded. Therefore, Teachers' salary costs were excluded from this exercise as these costs are not provided for under the Prisons budget allocation.  Similarly, capital expenditure, including building/equipment assets and small works, is excluded from the calculations in the interest of facilitating comparison between prison types.  The Irish Prison Service does not maintain the information required to calculate the average cost of the provision of services to prisoners provided by other Government Departments.

The majority of prisoners on lock up are those who would be considered to be under threat or "at risk" in the general population due for example to gangland feuding, drug debts, because they gave evidence in a court case or because of the nature of their offences, for example, those of a sexual nature.Requests for protection or to be accommodated in separate areas from other identified persons may also arise as a result of a request from the prisoner or after consideration by Prison management.  Significant numbers of what would be regarded as protection prisoners are accommodated on separate landings. These prisoners have access to a wide regime of activities including school, workshops, gym facilities, probation and chaplaincy services but do not mix with the general population in the prison and are not subject to a restrictedregime.It is at the committal stage that the majority of prisoners seek protection.  All prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and based on the information available, a decision is made, as to where a particular prisoner will be accommodated.  In some instances, prisoners are transferred to other establishments where they will not require protection.

The majority are managed by qualified staff from the Local Authority Library Services whose salary costs are refunded by the Irish Prison Service.  Prison staff assist the librarians and operate library services in some prisons.  The information requested is set out in the table in relation to ten prisons.PrisonScheduled Opening Hours (per week)% hours open January — October 2011Castlerea2025Cloverhill3565Limerick2059Loughan House775Midlands3233Mountjoy3430Portlaoise36.5100Shelton Abbey1094St. Patrick’s Institution*3598Wheatfield2814.15The figures for Dublin prisons are to the end of September 2011.  The figures up to the end of October 2011 will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as they are available.  Comparable data is not available in relation to the other prisons as these operate varying access arrangements structured to reflect demand, including scheduled and ad-hoc opening hours.While every effort is made to maintain reasonable access to library facilities in keeping with demand, opening hours were restricted in some prisons over this period mainly due to the need to redeploy staff to operational and security functions.  Where necessary, this is done on a rotational basis to help minimise disruption.The Inspector of Prisons recommended in his 2010 Annual Report that the Irish Prison Service commission an independent audit of prison education services.  This audit is currently under way and includes prison library services.  When the review is completed, the findings in relation to libraries will be assessed to develop a template for future library provision.

I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that a Governor attached to the Regimes Directorate within Prison Service Headquarters is responsible for Work and Training while there are no plans at this time to appoint a Co-ordinator of Education.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that it is currently in the process of enhancing its website.  The provision of more detailed statistical information generally including details on the numbers in custody is being considered as part of this re-design which will be completed next year.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	602	Visiting Committee is appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925.  There are currently 14 Visiting Committees — one for each institution.I announced plans some time ago to strengthen the independent oversight of our prisons.  Under new legislation to be prepared, I intend to make Visiting Committees more effective while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities. The arrangements for membership of the Committees will be changed and a link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons.Each Visiting Committee will comprise no more than six members, and only suitable people with appropriate qualifications and a genuine interest in prison issues will be appointed.  I believe this will provide for a more integrated approach generally and will enhance independent oversight of the prison system.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	603	As the Deputy will be aware, the current civil jurisdictional limits were set in 1991 at €38,092 and €6,384 for the Circuit and District Courts respectively.  Although Sections 13 and 14 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 provided for substantial increases in these limits, these were never commenced by previous Governments.  This matter is under review at present in my Department.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	604	On 17th November the Government announced its intention to rationalise 48 State agencies by the end of 2012 with a further 48 such agencies to be critically reviewed by 2012.  The three agencies mentioned in the Deputy's Question fall into this latter  category and it is proposed to critically review by the end of June 2012 the merger of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland and the Valuation Office into the Property Registration Authority of Ireland (PRAI).The PRAI is an independent statutory body falling under the aegis of my Department. The other two agencies, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland (OSI) and the Valuation Office (VO)  fall under the aegis of other Government Departments. I am therefore not in a position to respond to the Deputy in relation to the future role of the OSI and the VO and the efficiencies that can be delivered as these agencies do not fall within the remit of my Department and I have no responsibility for them.I can, however, inform the Deputy that, on the face of it, certain synergies appear to exist between the activities of the bodies concerned and that the matters which he has raised will be the subject of a detailed analysis to be undertaken in the coming months by an inter-departmental group which will incorporate consideration of all relevant issues including financial, legislative and personnel matters.  When the review has been completed the Government will then be in a position to make a decision and to report on these matters.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	605	The position is that Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby any person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in his or her dwellinghouse. The scheme is operated by the Property Registration Authority and since it was introduced in 1978, over 80,000 applicants have availed of it to acquire the freehold title to their property.I should add that a High Court judgment upholding the constitutionality of the ground rents legislation was delivered in early 2006 but was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court. That appeal has been heard and the Supreme Court has reserved its judgment.  The operation of the law in this area continues to be monitored in my Department.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	606	The Deputy will be aware that, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions which includes management of court venues and designation of court areas and I have no role in the matter.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that in the current financial climate all court venues are kept under continuing review.As I set out in my response to Question No. 45 on 25 October last, the Courts Service Board has already approved the closing of a number of District court houses as follows:Ballymote which will be amalgamated with Sligo.Boyle which will be amalgamated with Carrick on Shannon.  The Circuit Court also sits from time to time in Boyle and these sittings will now take place in Roscommon.Templemore which will be amalgamated with Thurles.Kiltimagh and Claremorris in Co. Mayo which will be amalgamated with Castlebar.  I understand the District Court has not sat in Claremorris since 2009 and that its business has been heard in Kiltimagh.  I am informed that the business of all three venues will in future be heard in Castlebar.While there are no court houses in Castleisland and Athenry, the Courts Service has informed me that those District Courts sit in very unsuitable premises and so will also be relocated.  With the exception of Castleisland which is due to close on 1 December, it is intended that the other closures will take effect early in 2012.  In this context it should be noted that the Board has over the past 12 years amalgamated 140 District Court areas.  Decisions to close a particular venue are generally taken due to its poor condition, some of which present a health and safety risk which would cost a great deal to rectify.The absence of holding cells in a number of cases is also a factor. However, achieving greater efficiencies particularly with regard to freeing up judicial, staff and Garda time currently spent travelling between venues is also a consideration.  I am informed that this rationalisation policy has gained operational efficiencies, saves time and improves speed of access to justice.  I understand a Review Group is currently examining all venues located outside of Dublin city and Cork city with a view to reporting to the Service by the end of this year.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position as Minister to provide legal advice in response to a Parliamentary Question on a particular case. However, I can indicate the following by way of general information.One of the principal objectives of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 is to ensure transfer of common areas of such developments to the owners' management companies concerned. Section 4 of the Act, which deals with partially completed developments, and section 5, which deals with substantially completed developments, provide that transfer of the relevant parts of the common areas must have been completed within 6 months of the coming into operation of the Act, i.e. before 1 October 2011.Section 24 of the Act establishes a new Circuit Court jurisdiction for the resolution of disputes in relation to multi-unit developments. It means that if such a dispute cannot be resolved by the parties concerned by means of mediation or other dispute resolution mechanism, the Court may, where it is satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, make an order with a view to ensuring effective enforcement of the right or effective discharge of the obligation concerned. Such an order may include an order transferring control of an owners' management company from a developer to the apartment owners where the Circuit Court is satisfied the developer has unreasonably refused to effect such a transfer.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	608	As the Deputy has indicated, a referendum is necessary to establish a Court of Appeal.  It is my intention to finalise examination of the detail and to progress the matter at the earliest suitable opportunity.  A decision remains to be taken by Government as to when such a referendum will take place in the context of other future referenda.  However, I do not anticipate that the holding of a referendum will occur before Autumn 2012.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I wish to inform the Deputy that I am currently in the process of appointing members to the Legal Aid Board.  I expect that the new Board will be in place in the coming weeks. Members will be appointed in accordance with section 4 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995. In making these appointments I will be mindful of the requirements of the Board and select members who will bring a balance of skills and experience suitable to address the task ahead of them.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	610	While there is no legal obligation on residents to clear snow and ice from public footpaths outside their homes, the Government encourages community groups, residence associations and individuals to do so in order to help to alleviate the effects of severe weather.  The legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the Office of Emergency Planning is that if a footpath is cleared in a safe manner, i.e. if the footpath is cleared in a manner which disposes of snow so as not to create a hazard, there is no issue of liability should an accident occur.  Further advice on this issue can be found on the recently launched website www.winterready.ie.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	611	In the past three years the Organisation of National ex-Servicemen (O.N.E.) received a subvention of €40,000 per annum from my Department and the Irish United Nations Veterans Organisation (IUNVA) received a subvention of €10,000 per annum from my Department.  The Department of Defence provides annual subventions to support and encourage the two officially recognised veteran groups, O.N.E. and IUNVA and representatives of both organisations hold formal meetings with Departmental officials.  While there is a range of other associations involving serving, retired and ex-Defence Forces personnel representing various interests at local, regional and national level, the Department has no plans to formally recognise any further veteran or other similar associations.  This position was communicated to the Irish Legion Association, by Departmental Officials, at a meeting on 18 November 2010.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 to 188, inclusive, together.Malaria is a serious disease which can cause serious complications and death.   It is estimated by the World Health Organization that approximately 1 million people die every year from malaria.  It has long been recognized as being a serious threat to any military force operating in a malarious area.For the individual, prevention of malaria depends largely on minimizing skin exposure to mosquito attack.  This involves the wearing of long sleeved shirts and long trousers, avoidance of outdoor activities at times when mosquitoes are most active, use of various insect repellents, etc.  A second line of defence involves the use of a chemoprophylactic agent.  This is taken orally and designed to ‘mop' up any parasites which may have entered the blood stream through the bite of an infected mosquito.The Defence Forces may only prescribe drugs, including anti-malarial drugs, which are licensed by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB).  The IMB is the national competent authority for the regulation of medicines and medical devices in Ireland.  The objective of the IMB is to ensure in so far as possible, consistent with current medical and scientific knowledge, the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines available in Ireland and to participate in systems designed to do that throughout the European Union. There are three IMB-licensed anti-malarial medications (chemoprophylaxis) available to the Defence Forces — Doxycycline, Lariam and Malarone.Cost has never been a deciding factor in choosing which of the three medications is prescribed for an individual.  The choice of chemoprophylaxis medication is based solely on which product gives the individual the best protection having regard to their medical profile, their destination and the duration of the deployment.a. Doxycycline has to be taken in the absence of dairy products.  It has a daily dosage regime.  It is cheaper than both Lariam and Malarone. While it can cause minor but troublesome, mainly gastrointestinal side effects, it can also produce sun-sensitivity skin rashes (akin to severe sun burn) in some individuals.  This is particularly significant when used in very sunny climes. For this reason it is not recommended for first line use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa.  It is the anti-malaria chemoprophylaxis of first choice by the Defence Forces in some geographic regions, e.g. Afghanistan;b. Lariam (mefloquine) was first authorised for use by the IMB in 1989.  The authorised product information provides details to ensure its safe and effective use given its side-effects profile including potential neuropsychiatric effects.  The IMB is of the view that the benefit/risk profile for the product remains acceptable.  From a compliance point of view, its weekly dosing regimen scores over the other available chemoprophylaxis.  Very simply stated, it is easier to remember a weekly medication than a daily medication, particularly where the entire unit uses the same ‘medication day'.  Lariam is the chemoprophylaxis agent of first choice in sub-Saharan missions undertaken by the Defence Forces;c. Malarone is unsuitable for use as it is licensed for no more than 28 days continuous use in a malarious area by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB).  In this context this prophylactic agent is only suitable for use where the overseas deployment does not exceed 28 days.  It has a daily dosage regime.  It is more expensive than both Doxycycline and Lariam.All of these drugs are recommended by the World Health Organisation and other travel advisory bodies such as the United States Centre for Disease Control.In accordance with best international practice in prescribing any of these medications, and taking account of the contra-indications, warnings and side effects highlighted by the IMB, the Defence Forces screen all personnel for medical suitability.  The screening system rules out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions for example depression, anxiety, neurodegenerative disorders etc., which, as has been indicated by the IMB and other regulatory bodies worldwide, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.In the case of overseas missions to malarious areas, the medical screening involves a one-on-one assessment of the individual's suitability to be prescribed the selected anti-malarial agent in line with current IMB guidelines.  This typically involves review of the individual's previous experience, if any, with the medication. The individual's medical history is also screened for those conditions which have been identified as precipitating serious side effects in association with the medication.  In addition, blood tests are carried out to ensure that the liver is healthy, as liver disease is an accepted contra indication to the use of Lariam.It is the policy of the Defence Forces Medical Corps that personnel who are found suitable for Lariam should commence their medication three — four weeks in advance of their travel.  The purpose of this precaution is two-fold — while it allows a slow build-up of the medication in the bloodstream, it also permits assessment by the person of their individual reaction to the medication while still in Ireland. During this ‘probationary' period the individual can consult with a Medical Officer (MO) over any adverse reaction, minor or major. Some minor reactions may be transient but if persistent, or troublesome, the individual will be deemed to have ‘sensitivity' to the medication and will be found not medically suitable for the mission.Personnel are screened both before and after deployments and all necessary actions are taken to ensure that those with contraindications to Lariam use are deemed unsuitable for overseas service and are not prescribed the medication.I am informed by the Director of the Defence Forces' Medical Corps (DMC) that the US Centre for Disease Control's Health Information for International Travel 2012 (the "Yellow Book") advises that a risk assessment be carried out before deciding on the use of a malaria chemoprophylactic agent.  Chapter 3 of the "Yellow Book" lists recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis, including Mefloquine (Lariam).Chapter 8 of this book contains a section relating to special considerations for US military deployments.  Reference is made to a policy memorandum issued by the US Assistant Secretary of Defence (Health Affairs) that recommended that Doxycycline or Malarone should be used instead of Lariam if they were equally efficacious for the areas being deployed to.  This, however, was in the context of very large-scale deployments where it is not possible to have the one-on-one assessment of an individual's suitability for Lariam that is carried out prior to deployments by members of the Irish Defence Forces.  I am informed by the DMC that he is aware of this memorandum.It should be noted that the primary area of operations for US Forces is Afghanistan currently. Neither the US Army nor Irish Defence Forces recommend Lariam as a first-line malaria chemoprophylaxis for Afghanistan.  A breakdown of costs in relation to malaria chemoprophylaxis dispensed by the Defence Forces (e.g. Lariam and Doxycycline) over the last 3 years is not readily available.  I will write separately to the Deputy about this matter.The Defence Forces Medical Corps do not perform post mortems when a member of the Defence Forces dies in service.  It is a matter for the Coroner's Office to determine whether a Post Mortem should be carried out which would then be carried out by an appointed pathologist.  It is therefore a matter for that pathologist to determine what procedures are used in post mortems.I am not aware of the specific views of the State Pathologist but I have confirmed that following the death of an Irish man in Vietnam in 2000 that the Dublin City Coroner notified the Irish Medicines Board that "concerns were expressed at the inquest in relation to possible psychotic reactions to Lariam".  I understand that the coroner made no conclusion whether Lariam was a contributing factor in the death.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	613	At this point in time, I do not envisage that there will be a role for the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) if a period of severe weather occurs during this winter.  Unless a situation was to arise that is far worse than has been the case in recent years, I am satisfied that the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) will once again be in a position to carry out all tasks assigned to it.  Preparations to cope with the possibility of severe weather occurring during this winter are ongoing.  The Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which I Chair, has been working to further develop the "whole of Government" approach to preparing for severe weather.  I recently Chaired a special meeting of the Task Force following which a public information campaign, including a dedicated website www.winterready.ie, was launched.During the periods of severe weather that occurred over the past two winters, all assets, resources and capabilities of the PDF nationally were made available to the Government Task Force, and its Inter Agency Coordination Committee, for the purpose of providing assistance where it was not possible for other agencies and organisations to respond. The PDF's involvement proved to be extremely effective as it responded to all requests for assistance received from the civil authorities.

Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue. During these checks, queries arose in respect of a land parcel that requires digitisation for AEOS purposes and also the location of two measures listed on the application of the person named.  The person named has been contacted in relation to these issues and my Department is awaiting the reply in order to further progress the application with a view to issuing payment as quickly as possible.

This scheme is aimed at assisting eligible owner(s) whose holding is restricted during the period from the 1 November to 30 April.My Department issues an application form to all potential applicants who are restricted during the eligibility period.  An essential condition for eligibility is that the holding of the applicant applying continues to be restricted following a full herd Reactor Re-test, with certain exceptions which are detailed in the documentation.  In addition, herdowners must not be in receipt of off farm income or must not have any income from milk sales during the period to which payment refers. Furthermore, an owner who moves animals into a restricted holding, with certain exceptions, will not be eligible for payment under the Hardship Grant Scheme from the date the animals are moved into the herd for the remainder of the restriction period. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme the onus is on the owner to apply immediately when s/he considers herself/himself to be eligible having regard to the eligibility criteria, as payment can only be paid from the date of receipt of the completed application.A maximum of €250.00 per month per herd may be paid under this scheme, for a period not exceeding 4 months during the eligibility period, with a payment of €38.00 per month for each suckler cow and €25.00 per month for each dairy cow or other animal.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	623	Under the Agriculture, (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, Teagasc has statutory responsibility for the provision of education, advisory and research services to the agriculture sector.  It is a matter for Teagasc and its Board to prioritise activities in the delivery of these services and to allocate its resources in accordance with these priorities. Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.Teagasc is currently implementing a major ‘Change Programme' 2009 — 2013 to address the need for significant resource rationalisation arising from ongoing budgetary challenges and to reorganise the organisation to meet the significant challenges that lie ahead. The Programme involves the closure of up to 40 local advisory offices, a reduction in research land resources, staff reductions and prioritisation of programme activities.

The total amount of money that will be paid on the Suckler Cow Scheme can only be determined at the end of the year as these payments continue to be made.I have also decided to make payments on eligible 2011 born calves and I have asked farmers, who want to get paid on 2011 born calves before the end of this year, to complete the registration of all of the measures under the Scheme as a priority. Therefore, the 2011 outturn will not be known until the end of the year as payments to farmers will continue into December.

Departmental staff are involved in a complex processing system, which in the case of the vast majority of applicants, cover a number of schemes such as the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Grassland Sheep Scheme, and Agri-Environmental Schemes such as REPS and AEOS. All in all some €1.8 billion is paid annually to over 130,000 farmers.My Department operates an extremely efficient processing system for the payment of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other area-based Schemes. Payment is generally made to the vast majority of farmers in the immediate time period following the earliest date for the commencement of payments and places Ireland to the forefront in the EU in terms of early delivery of direct payments. In a study to assess the administrative burden on farms arising from the CAP, consultants employed by the Commission established that Ireland has the lowest administrative cost of the five Member States involved in the study (Germany, Ireland, France, Italy and Denmark).In 2008 and previous years, payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme were limited to a maximum area of 45 hectares per beneficiary. In 2009 this maximum area was reduced to 34 hectares, due to budgetary constraints. While difficult decisions will have to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, my approach in preparing the 2012 Estimates for my Department is to focus available resources on the measures, which will reward active farmers, and that will allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector .

This is a target that I believe will be achieved through a focused and determined implementation of the report’s recommendations for the dairy sector, which include:(i) the need to improve on-farm competitiveness through, for example, animal health and genetic improvement programmes as well as increased efficiency through education and technology transfer,(ii) the need to ensure adequate capacity and maximum efficiency at processing level,(iii) the need to facilitate more commercially focused R&D and marketing activities, as well as further research into strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The provision of adequate processing capacity is of course a matter for the milk processing industry itself. It is encouraging that the importance of the issue has been acknowledged in the Dairy Expansion Activation Group's Road Map for the implementation of Food Harvest 2020 in the dairy sector, and I am confident that the processing industry will respond as necessary and will work with the rest of the sector to ensure that the Food Harvest 2020   objectives are met.

Therefore,  the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption will enter into force for Vietnam on 1 February 2012.As provided for in Section 72 of the Adoption Act, 2010, the Adoption Authority may establish administrative arrangements concerning the processing of applications with other Hague countries in relation to intercountry adoptions. Preliminary discussions have taken place regarding official visits and exchange of information between Ireland and Vietnam with a view to putting in place administrative arrangements under Section 72 of the 2010 Act.While the Hague Convention will take effect in Vietnam in February next, it is not yet clear how soon after that arrangements will be in place, in both jurisdictions, to allow inter country adoption recommence.  It might also be anticipated that for any sending country, commencing implementation of the  Hague framework, will begin slowly and may prioritise children with higher levels of need.  While every effort is being made by Irish authorities to develop the necessary administrative agreement and other requirements, certain operational elements of the process are purely a matter for the sending country.The position regarding the adoption agency referred to by the Deputy is that the application for accreditation by that agency is a matter for the Adoption Authority of Ireland. The Department understands that the Adoption Authority is awaiting information from the HSE on this matter.

Youth work programmes and services are delivered to young participants in the various programmes by some 1,100 youth work staff and by a volunteer base of over 60,000.In light of current budgetary constraints, the youth budget requires careful management with a focus on prioritising front-line services and protecting jobs in so far as is possible. Officials from my Department have met with representatives of the youth sector, including CDYSB, on an ongoing basis to ascertain the sector's views on how best to minimise the impact of budgetary constraints with a view to consolidating, in so far as is practicable, the progress made in previous years. Every effort will be made to notify the various youth work organisations and administering agencies of their 2012 allocations as speedily as possible.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am committed to the development of a new youth policy framework which my Department is currently progressing. Through this work a clear policy framework will emerge that will aim to enhance the development, participation and support of young people.I intend that the policy framework will also facilitate and promote co-ordination and coherence across departments and services and will set out the priorities, rationale and criteria for future funding programmes.  It will also accommodate issues relevant to young people within the 10-24 age range in informal or out-of-school settings that fall within the remit of my Department.   The overall aim will be to clarify and enhance coherence, connectivity, coordination and delivery in youth services and related out-of-schools services for young people and to ensure such provision is both quality and outcomes based.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	635	Firstly may I offer my condolences to the family that the Deputy refers to in his question.  As you are aware, my main objective as Minister for Health is to address the problems which have resulted in a health care system that all too often does not perform to a sufficiently high standard.  I can assure you that I am determined to address these health care issues and to ensure that the patient always remains central in our health care system.Immediately following my appointment I set about establishing the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  The SDU is focusing initially on emergency departments and will be working to support hospitals in addressing excessive waiting times for admission to hospital.  The SDU is working closely with the HSE to support performance management. As part of that work, the SDU is establishing an infrastructure based on information collection and analysis.  As a result of this exercise Beaumont Hospital was identified as a hospital that requires intense support from the SDU.I can confirm that Beaumont Hospital will receive over €400,000 in additional once off funding to help alleviate the emergency department pressures.  This funding will be used in a number of ways including the provision of additional discharge care packages and increased bed capacity.  I am confident that the implementation of these measures will result in an improved service in the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital.I am not aware of the investigations that the Deputy refers to. I have arranged for the question to be forwarded to the HSE who will respond to you directly in relation to investigations that maybe taking place under the auspices of the HSE.  The HSE has provided for a robust complaints mechanism, information regarding this can be accessed on the HSE website via http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/ysys/Complaints/HowTo/.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has statutory responsibility for the negotiation of prices with private and voluntary nursing homes. The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.  The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process. This method of negotiation is necessary in order to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.When negotiations on price break completely down with a particular private nursing home a review process has been developed by NTPF.   The case is transferred to an NTPF representative, not previously involved with negotiations, to take a completely fresh look at the file, the pricing proposals and the facts of the case.   A written report of this peer review is then produced.  If this step proves to be unsuccessful the file may be submitted to the NTPF Director of Finance for further consideration.   If agreement on price still cannot be reached after these steps the file is submitted to the NTPF CEO for a final decision.  To protect resident interests throughout this process the nursing home is offered a roll over agreement at the last agreed price.The spirit and intent of this method is to ensure that each pricing submission is given a rigorous, reasonable and fair assessment by NTPF and, so far, has proved to be a practical business like way for both sides to deal with contentious issues.  Details of the review process have been shared with the representative body for private nursing homes (Nursing Homes Ireland) and it is also set out on the NTPF website.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	641	The health service requires strong management capacity to deliver on service targets in an effective and efficient way within available resources, and also to lead change in a complex environment.  As stated in the Programme for Government, in conjunction with the introduction of universal health insurance, public hospitals will become independent, not-for-profit trusts.  This will require the development of the necessary corporate governance, management and clinical capacity to ensure that these hospitals are equipped to function efficiently and effectively, once established as independent service providers.The establishment of hospital trusts is an important stepping stone towards the introduction of universal health insurance which is the ultimate destination of the Governments reform programme.  My first priority has been the establishment of the special Delivery Unit to tackle patient flows and, specifically, the crisis in the Emergency Departments in our hospital system.  To make such change sustainable there must be genuine accountability across the system and hospital trusts will be a key part of this.  My Department has already begun some preliminary work looking at comparable models in other jurisdictions.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	644	The Health Service Executive has advised me that expenditure on health services for people with a disability in 2011 will be approximately €1.5 billion.  Special consideration was given to disability and mental health in Budget 2011 through a maximum reduction of just 1.8% in the allocation for the two sectors.  The relatively lower reduction of 1.8%, compared to other areas of the health budget that saw reductions of up to 5%, recognises that these services are provided to vulnerable groups and should help to ensure that existing services are maintained and that priority is given to the delivery of frontline services.I recognise and appreciate the valuable contribution that St. Michael's House makes to the provision of services to individuals with intellectual disabilities in Dublin and Navan through a range of community-based day, respite, and residential services on behalf of the Health Service Executive.  The HSE has advised that St. Michael's House will receive approximately €72 million in funding from them in 2011.  Taking the reduction in the overall HSE disability budget for 2011 into account, the HSE was asked to manage the additional resources and engage with service providers including St. Michael's House, to ensure that existing support needs, and demands for additional places and supports, are managed effectively within the overall allocation.Budget 2012With regard to the level of funding for the Disability sector next year, this is being considered as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and Estimates process for 2012 which is currently underway. Deliberations on the expenditure allocations for 2012 are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  As you are aware, the very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.Value for Money & Policy Review of Disability ServicesA major priority for the Government in the coming months will be to finalise the current Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services to ensure that existing funding for people with disabilities is spent to best effect. It is now more important than ever that large scale spending programmes of this nature are subject to detailed periodic review. The VFM Efficiency and Effectiveness Review will make recommendations that will ensure that the very substantial funding of €1.5 billion provided to the specialist disability health sector is used to maximum benefit for persons with disability, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	651	I apologise for the delay in responding to the Deputy in relation to his question of the 14th September regarding savings that could be made if charges based on the full economic cost to all use of beds in public and voluntary hospitals for the purposes of private medical practice.Charging the full economic cost for all use of beds in public and voluntary hospitals for the purpose of private medical practice would involve two changes to the current system: (i) raising the charges to reflect the full costs of treatment and (ii) revising the bed designation system to allow charges for all private patients in public hospitals. The issue of the level of private patient charges was examined in the Department's 2010 ‘Value for Money and Policy Review of the Economic Cost and Charges Associated with Private and Semi-Private Treatment Services in Public Hospitals'.  The Review recommended a refined per diem costing methodology which allowed for higher private patient charges in 2011 and 2012 for the purposes of generating revenue and reducing the previous subsidy for private treatment.  The total increase in income was estimated to be €93m.  An increase of €75m was targeted for recovery in 2011 (an overall increase of 21%) and a further increase in the charges will be applied for 2012 which will close the subsidy to private treatment and generate an estimated additional €18m for the health system.In order to control the level of private activity in publicly funded hospitals and to help ensure equitable access for public patients to services in these facilities, a system of bed designation is operated in public hospitals. The regulations underpinning this system stipulate that hospitals can only apply charges to private patients when they are treated in designated private or semi-private beds.  Approximately 20% of public hospital beds are designated as private.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has previously found that charges are not raised in respect of about half of all private patients because they are not occupying private designated beds.In excess of €350m is currently raised in private health insurance charges.  On the basis that only 50% of private patients are currently charged and that charges will be further increased in 2012 to reflect the full average cost, it is estimated that approx. €370m could be saved through charging the full average cost for all private treatment.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I presume the Deputy refers to an application, from the person whose details are supplied, to have her professional qualifications recognised under Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications.  Qualification recognition and registration are distinct separate processes.  At present there is no system for the statutory registration in Ireland of the profession of the applicant; this will in time be provided for by the relevant Registration Board of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.Directive 2005/36/EC applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EEA Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications.  Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in EEA countries other than their own but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualification for public health and safety and consumer protection.For the purposes of the Directive, a regulated profession is defined as a professional activity access to which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications.  Where statutory registration does not exist for a profession in Ireland, non-Irish qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the Health Service Executive.  Persons should not seek employment in their professional capacity in the publicly-funded health service in Ireland unless and until their qualifications have been recognised.Under Statutory Instruments Nos. 139 and 166 of 2008, which transpose the Directive into Irish law, the Minister for Health and Children is the Competent Authority for the profession in question; the process is administered by the National Validation Office of the Health Service Executive (NVO) which is advised by the relevant professional body.For the profession of the person to whom the Deputy refers, the Directive does not provide for automatic recognition of professional qualifications obtained in another Member State; it provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in the host member state.  If the activities covered by the profession in the home and the host member state are not comparable, then the qualifications cannot be recognised.  If the activities are comparable but deficits in the qualifications are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be considered.  If deficits still remain, the host Member State must offer an applicant a compensation measure, a choice of completing an adaptation period or taking an aptitude test.Applications must be acknowledged within one month and the applicant informed of any missing document.  A final decision must be communicated to the applicant within four months of submission of a complete application.  These time frames are clearly signalled on the Department's and the NVO's websites.It would be inappropriate to comment on individual applications but my Department is advised by the National Validation Office of the HSE that the applicant's initial application was incomplete.  A complete application was acknowledged from the person concerned on 10th November, 2011 and a substantiated decision must therefore issue by 10th March, 2012.  The Deputy will understand that, in the interest of patient safety, the applicant must allow time, as provided for in the EU Directive, for the assessment of her non-Irish qualifications to ensure they meet Irish standards.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	656	While the Programme for Government provides for a reduction in consultants' remuneration, my immediate priority is to achieve more effective implementation of the existing contract so that patients get faster access to services and that better patient outcomes are achieved within the budgets available to hospitals.  I believe there is considerable scope under the existing contract and the Public Service Agreement to achieve greater productivity from consultants.  For example, increased consultant participation in patient discharges at weekends could more quickly free up beds for emergency admissions.  I am satisfied that considerable efficiencies can be achieved under the terms of the 2008 contract, if consultants embrace this reform agenda.The 2008 Consultant contract provides for an extended working day, an increase in the length of the working week and structured weekend work, with consultants working as part of a team delivering the Clinical Directorate Service Plan and focusing on greater equity in the provision of care.  I believe that the efficiencies, productivity increases and reform, if achieved, will be worth more to the health system than simply reducing the pay of consultants.  I would therefore strongly encourage consultants and their representative bodies to engage in a meaningful way with the HSE and hospital management to progress this important agenda.

The Business Case is strong and it is projected to operate without any operating subsidy.  Luas BXD will result in up to 10 million extra trips on the Luas network, exploiting the true value in the investment made to date in Luas infrastructure.  The decision of An Bord Pleanála on the Railway Order application for this project is expected shortly.As regards the proposed DART link to the Airport, on my appointment as Minister I requested Irish Rail to prepare a preliminary business plan for this project which was reviewed by the National Transport Authority (NTA).While these two projects are not strictly comparable as they seek to serve different transport needs, the NTA have advised that DART to the Airport does not deliver the same returns with regard to passenger numbers and reduction of car trips and there is less certainty over the expected economic benefits and its projected cost.  In addition, the NTA consider that the proposal does not adequately address the overall public transport needs in the strategic Airport /Swords and Ballymun corridors.  Furthermore, the DART to the Airport line may lead to a reduction in direct services to Howth, Sutton and Bayside and would undermine the ability to grow railway services north of Clongriffin in the medium term.Accordingly, on the basis of the information provided by the NTA, the strategic and economic case for the Luas BXD project is more favourable than that of the DART Airport link proposal in terms of addressing the public transport needs of the region.

At the plenary meeting, Ministers noted that the provision of further funding by the Irish Government for the A5 road is being deferred and that in this regard the Irish Government will provide £25m per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the project.  It was also noted that the relevant departments will now prepare a new funding and implementation plan for the projects for agreement at the next NSMC Transport meeting with endorsement at the next NSMC Plenary meeting.I cannot comment on the attitude of another minister and this question should be put directly to him. However, I have a very good relationship with the Minister for Regional Development of the Northern Ireland Executive, Danny Kennedy MLA, and co-operation is good.

These include the merger of the Railway Procurement Agency with the National Roads Authority and the merger of the Irish Aviation Authority with the Commission for Aviation Regulation by June 2012.  There will also be a critical review by the same date of the establishment of a single transport safety body comprising of the Road Safety Authority, Railway Safety Commission and the Maritime Safety Authority.  The potential savings arising from these mergers will be identified as detailed implementation plans are developed.
