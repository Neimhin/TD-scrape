I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I propose the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public concern, namely the proposal to create four regional hospital networks just months after the creation of ten smaller networks, with the consequent impact on hospitals, the irrational and unrealistic geographic spread of the proposed networks and the creation of monolithic structures not unrelated to the discarded Hanly report recommendations.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I ask that the Dáil Éireann be adjourned under Standing Order 31 to analyse the fallout following the decision by the HSE to put the PPARs and FISP computer systems on hold, the cost implications involved and the lessons to be learned before another euro is spent by the HSE or by the Tánaiste on computer systems and consultants.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I seek that the business of the Dáil be adjourned under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely to allow a statement by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children explaining why an emergency plan had to be put into operation at Cork University Hospital yesterday only months after new accident and emergency facilities had opened at the hospital.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	5	It is proposed to take No. 16, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-20 the specific programme ‘Civil Justice' as part of the general programme ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice'; and No. 16a. motion re “The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act”; No. 23, Criminal Justice Bill 2004 — Second Stage (resumed).It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 16 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on No. 16a. shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after two hours and the following arrangements shall apply: the speeches of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; Members may share time; a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	6	There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No.16, motion of referral to joint committee re civil justice programme and motion re membership of committee agreed?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	7	We feel we cannot agree to this or any other part of the Order of Business until we have a commitment from the Tánaiste regarding a very important matter to be dealt with today by the Health Service Executive.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The Deputy did not proclaim her interest this morning.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	9	What was that?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I am sorry, but the Minister of State has made a charge and my good name is being impugned.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	11	He should stand up and withdraw it.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I ask him to withdraw it now.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I withdraw nothing.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The Minister of State said that I did not declare my interest this morning on the radio. That is impugning my good name and I ask him to withdraw that charge now.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	15	He should stand up and explain himself.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I withdraw my remarks.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I thank the Minister of State for withdrawing the charge. Will the Tánaiste agree to come into the House so that we can debate the issue surrounding the money wasted on two computer systems in the health service? The decision to be made today will have great significance in the management of the health service and we need to debate it in this Parliament. If it is not possible to debate the issue today, we should ensure that we have this debate at the very earliest opportunity next week. I ask the Tánaiste to agree to that provision so that we can ensure this matter is dealt with in the appropriate way.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I second that request and Members will be aware that I asked for that debate under Standing Order 31. In ensuring that we learn lessons from what has happened, I ask the Government to facilitate such a debate.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I oppose the procedure followed for the motion regarding the civil justice programme, as it is without debate. This is one of a number of motions relating to justice and home affairs that have been processed without debate in this House. This motion is only a small part of The Hague programme and the Minister admitted in committee that The Hague programme had to be revisited because it was tied to the adoption of the EU Constitution. Therefore, we are passing a motion that has been overtaken by events and we should put it on hold. The Hague programme frontloads contentious measures including judicial and police co-operation without regard for the great differences between member states on the issue of human rights protection. I urge that this motion be put on hold and that we have a proper debate on The Hague programme as I requested several times in the past year.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	20	On a point of order, regarding No. 16, I wish to record that this is the second time this week that a motion has come back from committee to this House without a previous report being supplied to the Whips, as has been the agreed protocol. I would like an explanationfrom the Government as to why that is not happening.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	21	This matter went to the committee where it was fully discussed. In response to Deputy McManus, we have had a debate for the past two evenings on PPARS and other issues.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	22	It was about overspending in general.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I am sorry but, as the Deputy knows, this issue was extensively dealt with. The board of the Health Service Executive will make decisions this morning. It is a matter for it and I am sure, in due course, the House will be in a position to raise this issue again.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I will put the question.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I want to point out to the Tánaiste that we are talking about today's decision.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Deputy cannot speak twice on the same motion.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I appreciate that but we could not debate a decision being made today over the past 48 hours. I am talking about a debate flowing from a decision that will be made by the HSE today. The Government is again avoiding responsibility by refusing my request.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16a, motion re “The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act”, agreed?
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	29	There is wide support on the proposal as it is presented to the House. Before we agree to it I would like an assurance that the Government would ensure that similar and equivalent measures that we are seeking for Irish citizens in America who are on the run would be introduced here for non-nationals in Ireland, including American citizens who are on the run from the authorities because they do not have work permits.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I would be supportive of that but I would also like to amend the Order of Business as it relates to this item. Speaking slots of 15 minute have been proposed after the opening speakers. I propose that the subsequent slots would be of ten minutes' duration because the cycle that is proposed would preclude the Technical Group from receiving a second speaking slot. On that ground I would ask the Government to be prepared to change the Order of Business.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	31	We would support that.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I would be happy to accede to that if the House is in agreement.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Is the proposal agreed to? Agreed.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Can I have some response to my question from the Tánaiste?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	35	We can deal with that during the debate.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	36	We are not dealing with it in the debate as it is not covered in the debate.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I am sure the Deputy can raise it in the debate with the relevant Minister.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	38	And he can ignore it again.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I understand that on Tuesday he marked the anniversary of his 44th year of election to this House. We do not see that very often these days. He is looking fit and well on it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Hear, hear.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Regarding three areas where there has clearly been serious wastage of public money, PPARS at a cost €150 million, electronic voting at a cost €60 million and the e-lab project at a cost of €35 million, making a total of almost €250 million, can the Tánaiste confirm if the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is speaking for the Government when he says the amount of money misspent is relatively very small? Is that view shared by the Government, or does collective responsibility apply to comments made by Ministers in that regard?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	42	It is 1%. To what legislation does the 1% relate?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	43	It is the legislation governing the competence of Government. It has been promised a great deal outside.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Is legislation proposed in this area? We are speaking about 1%.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Stop digging, Noel.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The Opposition have one-track minds at the moment.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The Minister said it was relatively very small. If he were to say that to the people in Mullingar who are waiting seven years for €10 million to finish off their hospital, they would give him his answer fairly fast.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Is Deputy Kenny in favour of sacking civil servants like Deputy Durkan suggested yesterday?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Will the Tánaiste give the House an update on a report referred to in today's newspaper regarding an investigation into a £13 million portfolio of property owned by the IRA in Manchester, and whether this has anything to do with the Northern Bank raid?Given the Tánaiste's confirmation that excessive charges were paid to consultants in the PPARS project and the serious revelations that have now come to light, I have been contacted by a number of people about other projects.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	50	To what legislation does this refer?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I suggest to the Tánaiste that perhaps the Government should have the Department of Finance carry out a review of all information technology projects that have been conducted by agencies similar to PPARS. There is legitimate concern about a number of other projects.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	52	She should have a look at the voting machines to see if they have gone rusty.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	53	The questions must relate to promised legislation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I did congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on the anniversary of his election.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	55	That is not related either to promised legislation.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	56	They have money to burn and they are burning it.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Likewise, I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. On promised legislation, the House has been promised by the Government over the past three years that the building control Bill will be introduced in this session. It is now promised for this session. Can the Tánaiste indicate whether it has been passed by Cabinet?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I join Deputy Kenny and Deputy Quinn in congratulating the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on serving 44 years. I wish him many more years in Leinster House, if that is what he wishes. It does prove that politics is not necessarily bad for our health.I wish to clarify something as I have been asked to do so by the staff involved. Deputy Kenny referred yesterday to a party that cost €40,000. That party was paid for by the staff involved. They have asked me to clarify that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Wrong again.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	61	What were they celebrating?
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	62	It must have been a big party.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	63	It was their Christmas party. Furthermore, they say that was clear from the details that were submitted to Deputy Kenny and which were obtained under the freedom of information legislation.The building control Bill has not yet been cleared by Cabinet but it is the intention to have it this session.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Will the Tánaiste indicate when we will have a debate in the House on the UN summit that was held last month? We must discuss issues such as the failure of the countries involved to deal with the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Deputy should conclude.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	66	It is important that we would have a debate in the House on the summit.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	67	That is a good idea and it should be discussed with the Whips.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	68	On behalf of the Green Party I join the congratulations to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his 44 years in the House and I wish him many more.Given the CMOD meeting on 1 June at which consultants were regarded as having produced work mirroring the work of other consultants, it is important that we would look at the Ministers and Secretaries Act and perhaps include training in computers for Ministers so that consultants are not able to pull the wool over their eyes and, as a result, charge exorbitant fees beyond what is needed. Technology must be brought into the legislation so there is an awareness that we will not be throwing away a great deal of taxpayers' money on the basis of lack of expertise among Ministers. Can the Ministers and Secretaries legislation be amended in that regard?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I was talking to student nurses yesterday, all of whom are going abroad. In terms of the nurses (amendment) Bill, is there a way we can encourage nurses trained in this country to stay here? We need them.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	71	We will have legislation on nurses in the House next year. As Deputy Sargent is aware, the vast majority of nurses educated here remain here.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	72	On promised legislation, I wish to ask about the long-standing promise to introduce random breath testing for motorists, which is a target in the current road safety strategy. Unfortunately there does not seem to be a reference to it in the programme for legislation. Will the Tánaiste outline the Government's intentions in this regard? Does it propose to introduce random breath testing? Why is there no reference to relevant legislation in the current programme?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I am sure random breath testing would be covered by an intoxicating liquor Bill or a transport Bill. I do not see any legislation promised in that area.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I call on Deputy Durkan.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The Deputy should table a question.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	77	The Tánaiste has given a commitment to introduce legislation to provide for it.

In view of the Government's litany of overspending and miscalculations, would it not be timely to mark its progress to date by introducing the national monuments Bill? It would allow us to mark the occasion suitably as a milestone to inefficiency, incompetence and bungling.

Does she have the same confidence in the multinational firms that control alcohol as the Taoiseach when he says the firms themselves are now policing this advertising? Alternatively, would she not agree with me that it is a case of expecting the fox to restrain itself when fat chickens come into view? If the Tánaiste takes seriously her responsibility as Minister for Health and Children, will she put forward the relevant legislation again?

Deputy Joe Higgins should note that there are more issues associated with drink culture than advertising alone.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I am sure we have already had an opportunity in the parliamentary Labour Party to wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle warm congratulations on his achieving 44 years in this House.On today's Order of Business, we are informed that questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs are scheduled for this afternoon. Will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle offer me guidance on a very important matter in this regard? A practice has grown in which parliamentary questions are transferred arbitrarily from one Minister to another without consultation with the spokespersons or the Office of the Ceann Comhairle. Today I tabled a question on the ratification of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and compliance therewith, which is a specific function on the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The preparation of the domestic legislation would be a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform after ratification, which I understand has not happened. The question has been transferred by the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform without consultation with me, who tabled the question as a priority question today.This practice is happening not only in respect of questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs today but also in respect of other questions. The Office of the Ceann Comhairle is supposed to protect the Order of Business, put through the process of this House. Ministers and their Department officials are consulting one another and arbitrarily transferring questions, as today. It is absurd. My question on ratification today refers to the fact that the United Nations Convention against Corruption needs four or five signatures to become a legal instrument internationally. That is the function of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Canvassing for support of the convention is a function of our ambassador to the United Nations. It is only in the event of its having been made a legal instrument that its transfer into domestic legislation arises.What will the office of the Ceann Comhairle do to ensure some respect for Deputies and spokespersons who go to the trouble of tabling questions? They should reasonably expect that they will be answered by the correct Minister. A few minutes ago, the Tánaiste advised a Deputy to table a question to the line Minister. However, questions have been put to line Ministers and they have been outrageously and improperly transferred to colleagues. What will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle do to ensure there is respect for this House?

The Office of the Ceann Comhairle agreed it was absurd, as did the General Office. The question has disappeared and nobody will answer it.

We do not have a function to keep them accountable. We have established tribunals because of the lack of answers to questions in this House.

This issue of the United Nations Convention against Corruption is central to the furtherance of our development programme in overseas countries, a programme which has been recently expanded, and this House is concerned about corruption. This issue has been raised domestically and internationally as contingent and relevant to the expansion of our programme which will amount to €1.5 billion when it reaches its full capacity of 0.7%. It is a matter for urgent debate in this House. It is fundamentally a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In domestic terms, when the convention is due to be implemented by legislation, it is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but, in terms of debate and legitimate questioning of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it is a matter for that Minister.On the second matter——

There is quite a time difference between the present and when the questions are due to be answered. I formally ask the Minister for Foreign affairs whether he will answer the question that was put to him in the first instance.

It is a great pity, considering that requests are coming from both sides of the House, that he would do so and that the Tánaiste appears paralysed in terms of determining this matter. Last night, the Tánaiste said the amount of money going to consultants was excessive. When it comes to awarding contracts to consultants, does the Government pay any attention——

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I move:That Dáil Éireann, concerned at the plight of undocumented Irish people living in difficult circumstances in the United States of America:—welcomes the high priority being given by the US President and Congress to addressing the issue of immigration reform in a way which takes account of the particular position of the undocumented, and also of the security of US borders;—recognises in particular that the undocumented Irish are unable to return to Ireland for visits and that this imposes significant hardship on their families in Ireland, including in many cases elderly parents;—recognises further that these people have made and continue to make a valuable contribution to the economic and social life of the United States;—notes that there are a number of Bills before the US Congress at present which propose different means of legislating for immigration reform;—deeply appreciates the support given by many members of Congress to efforts to resolve the difficulties facing the undocumented Irish; and—expresses its strong support for the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act introduced on 12 May 2005 in the US Senate by Senator Edward Kennedy and Senator John McCain and in the US House of Representatives by Rep. Jim Kolbe and Rep. Jeff Flake.I thank the House for the opportunity to propose this motion. The situation facing our undocumented community in the United States is of deep concern to the Government and to all Members of the Oireachtas. The focus which our debate gives to this marginalised group of Irish people, and to their families here at home, is timely and welcome.Immigration reform is now a pressing priority on the domestic political agenda in the United States of America. Today's debate and all-party motion reflects this House's collective support for the comprehensive and bipartisan approach to immigration reform proposed by Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator John McCain and their colleagues in the House of Representatives. Its provisions, if enacted, would enable undocumented people, including the undocumented Irish, to participate fully in the life of their adopted home free from fear and uncertainty.I would like to express my deep appreciation for the priority which Members of the Oireachtas have attached to this important issue. Today's debate follows from useful meetings, including with Senator McCain, which an Oireachtas delegation had recently on Capitol Hill. These contacts build on a number of other visits to Washington this year by Members of the Oireachtas. In May the Government was represented by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, at a meeting of the Irish Apostolate USA in Washington DC. Delegations from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael also attended that conference and had useful meetings with political contacts. Fr. Alan Hilliard, the director of the Irish Episcopal Commission on Emigrants, who organised the meeting, is with us in the House today. I welcome his presence and appreciate his important work and the leadership of the chairperson of the commission, Bishop Seamus Hegarty.In June the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs visited New York and Washington DC to examine at first hand the issue of the undocumented Irish in the US. It too had useful meetings which informed it of the situation on the ground. For my part, I have raised the concerns of the Government regarding the undocumented on each of my many visits to the US during my time as Minister for Foreign Affairs.The strong engagement by colleagues in the House is welcome and, in a significant way, complements the very active representations which the Government and the embassy are making on our behalf on an ongoing basis. Members of the House also maintain close contacts with the US ambassador, James Kenny. I take this opportunity to thank him most sincerely for his helpful and open engagement with us on an issue which is of such concern to the Irish people.Emigration is a central theme of the Irish experience. Generations of our people were all too familiar with the searing pain of separation, loss and isolation. Communities throughout this island were left stagnant as their youth sought economic opportunities elsewhere. The haemorrhaging of our young was accepted by many as the depressing norm. Fortunately, our recent economic success has reversed this trend. Figures released last month by the CSO estimate that in 2005 as many as 19,000 Irish nationals will return to Ireland, while the numbers emigrating will drop to 16,600. Many of the latter are thought to be young people taking a year off to travel before returning to work or college at home. For the first time in our history, we are creating sufficient job opportunities to employ all our citizens of working age. As a people we should take particular pride in this achievement, but we should never forget the trauma of the past nor the plight of those who remain in difficulty abroad. There is a danger that the sustained prosperity of the past decade could dim the collective memory of how painful were our recent waves of emigration.The second half of the 20th century witnessed two periods of intense emigration. Some 400,000 people left Ireland in the 1950s and in the 1980s we suffered a further heavy outflow. As the House is aware, many of those forced to leave during the 1980s went to the USA and many of the problems this group encountered are replicated in the case of today's undocumented. Though the numbers affected today are much fewer than in the past, the individual experience of isolation and uncertainty remains the same.While we take great satisfaction in fresh opportunities at home, we must recognise that our new prosperity brings new responsibilities. Meeting the needs of our community living abroad is one such responsibility. I assure the House that the Government is more committed than ever to representing its interests. This commitment is reflected in the establishment of new structures and the provision of significantly increased financial resources. I guarantee it is a commitment that will deepen and grow in the years ahead.Through its engagement with Irish people abroad, the Government and social partners saw the need for a more structured and strategic approach to our emigration policy. The task force on policy regarding emigrants, which was established by my predecessor, produced a very helpful report which provides us with a framework to guide our policy in this area. We have made significant progress in advancing policies and supporting services in keeping with its recommendations. The establishment of a dedicated unit within my Department focused entirely on matters relating to our emigrants has enhanced our capacity and effectiveness in this area. It is driving forward progress on all of the important areas identified by the task force. I am determined to ensure that this progress is maintained.Funding to groups working with our vulnerable emigrants has never been higher. It is now more than eight times greater than in 1997. In 2005 my Department's financial support for emigrant services has reached €8.273 million. This is the highest amount ever allocated and represents an increase of 63% on last year. It reflects the Government's firm determination to increase support for groups in the voluntary sector. This upward trend in financial support will continue.While the numbers settling in the US are nowhere near as high as they once were, there are still many families and communities in Ireland where the connection with America is as strong as ever. I am also conscious that the undocumented form part of a wider Irish community in the US. Some 164,000 Irish-born people were resident there in 2000. In addition to the large number of Irish who have made their home in the US, many young Irish people spend time there on study or business visas.As Irish and US commercial ties grow ever stronger, the traffic in both directions continues to be strong. The US is our largest source of inward investment and has been central to the growth and modernisation of Irish industry. I am happy to note this relationship is increasingly two way. Irish-owned companies in the US account for some 65,000 jobs there and there are over 200 offices in the US run by Irish exporters. We are very aware that the strategic interests of many of our companies benefit from the transfer of personnel to subsidiaries in the US.We are also conscious that the future innovative capacity of Irish companies benefits from academic research exchanges. Our embassy in Washington is actively working with Irish agencies and the US authorities to ensure that we can maximise the opportunities that are available for such exchanges. In other words, the relationship between the US and Ireland is maturing, deepening and is bringing increased economic benefits to our two peoples.The Government remains deeply committed to supporting efforts aimed at alleviating the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US. Comprehensive immigration reform is fast becoming a leading priority for President Bush and legislators in Congress. This increased engagement is encouraging. Over the years, we have been very fortunate to have the support and assistance of many friends in Congress. In the 1980s when the number of the Irish undocumented was much greater than today we worked closely with these friends, notably Congressmen Morrison andDonnelly. Those efforts brought very substantial benefits and largely addressed the problem at that time. We remain deeply appreciative of their support.The fact that there is no firm figure for the current number of those undocumented tells us a lot about the nature of the problem. The undocumented stay below the radar, fearful of detection. We have heard of various estimates. A figure of 3,000 undocumented Irish people has been estimated by US authorities but this certainly seems to be a low estimate. Some in the Irish community in the US consider that the numbers could be as high as 50,000. We believe that the true figure is probably closer to 25,000.Overall, the essential problem of the undocumented is not its size. It is the nature of being undocumented and that experience, rather than the number, that should be our focus. For the undocumented, the stress of separation, the strain and anxiety of living in the shadows and the deep sadness of being unable to return to Ireland to visit ageing parents or to attend family occasions such as weddings or funerals, remains traumatic. These people work hard. They contribute positively to their communities and to their adopted country. They rightly take pride in their achievements. They are anxious to have the opportunity to come out of the shadows and regularise their status. They deserve our support and the support of the Irish people.Irish immigration centres in the US provide invaluable assistance to the undocumented and to other vulnerable members of our community there. This service is of particular relevance and value at this complex time of change and uncertainty. The importance of their work is recognised and deeply appreciated by the Government. During my visit to New York last month, I announced grants to the immigration centres amounting to some €750,000. This represents an increase in funding of 40% on last year and is more than double the amount that was available just two years ago.While in New York, I convened a meeting of representatives of all the Irish immigration centres in the United States. It was the first time that such a collective meeting had taken place. I valued the opportunity to hear a first hand account of the strain which the undocumented status can place on young Irish people. Many are poorly equipped to deal with the difficult situation in which they find themselves.The undocumented are increasingly feeling the impact of a more restrictive security climate. Tighter border security measures, greater likelihood of identity checks and difficulties securing driving licences were all put forward as examples of increased pressure on them. The centres share a concern about a perceived rise in stress related problems and substance misuse. They are responding to this by developing in-house counselling services. This is an area where they plan to increase their capacity and I have asked my officials to see what we can do to help them in this. Of course, the remit of the centres extends beyond the undocumented Irish. They are active in a wide range of areas, including working with older marginalised Irish people.At our New York meeting, we also had a stimulating exchange of views on the prospects for immigration reform in the US. The representatives of the centres are keenly appreciative of the sensitivities in this debate and of the difficult climate for reform. They warmly welcome the engagement of the Government and Members of the Oireachtas in this matter. The Irish undocumented form a small part of a much larger number in the US, where the total undocumented population is thought to exceed 10 million. Many of these people have left homes in Mexico and further south in the Americas in search of opportunities in the US.We all appreciate that immigration is a sensitive and a divisive issue in the US, particularly since the tragic events of 11 September 2001. Security considerations are understandably very much to the fore. The challenge facing US legislators is to secure consensus around a comprehensive set of reforms which addresses both the situation facing the undocumented and the need for increased security of borders. I am acutely aware of the complexity of this task and deeply appreciative of the high priority which President Bush attaches to it. When the Taoiseach and I met with him on St. Patrick's Day, President Bush assured us of his commitment to making progress and advancing this issue in Congress. We also welcome the commitment of many members of Congress to find a solution in a pragmatic and compassionate way. In my meetings with Senators Kennedy, McCain and other political leaders on Capitol Hill, I have been struck by the strength of their personal commitment to immigration reform.The tabling last May of the bipartisan Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act by Senators Kennedy and McCain and Representatives Kolbe, Flake and Gutierrez represents a constructive and comprehensive response to immigration and border security concerns. The Bill, if adopted, would open a route to legality for undocumented people, including the undocumented Irish. They could regularise their status by applying for a temporary residency visa. They would receive work and travel authorisation. They could come out of the shadows and generally enjoy greater peace of mind. Significantly, they could travel to and from Ireland without fear of being refused re-entry. They would also have greater protection in the work place, and be eligible for health insurance.A further attractive aspect of the Kennedy-McCain proposal is that it includes provision for a path to permanent residency. Holders of temporary visas could, in due course, apply for a green card once qualifying criteria are met. This would be a particularly welcome development.We know that this comprehensive proposal will have to be examined in detail by Congress. There are other bills also to be examined, including a significant one introduced last July by Senators Kyl and Cornyn. The Kennedy-McCain Bill, as drafted, best meets the needs of our undocumented. The Kyl-Cornyn Bill differs from it in some essential respects, most significantly in not providing a path for permanent residency for the undocumented. These two bills have each been read once on the Senate floor and have been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further consideration. A preliminary committee hearing on both bills took place on 26 July and a further hearing is scheduled for later this month.It is still too early to say how the debate within Congress may develop in the period ahead. It is clear, however, that the US Administration and Congress regard immigration as a priority area and are keen to advance the debate. Nothing, however, can be assumed or taken for granted beyond the reality that the debate in both Houses of Congress will be lengthy and lively.I can assure the House that the Government will continue to strongly support all measures which would benefit our community in the US. In addition to our political contacts, our ambassador and diplomats in the US will remain active on this issue and meet regularly with contacts on the Hill. In this way we can ensure that our particular concerns are understood and that our strong support for the approach favoured by Senators Kennedy and McCain is given due consideration.President Kennedy once noted that "immigrants have enriched and strengthened the fabric of American life". On tabling his bill in May, Senator Kennedy stayed with this theme, saying that the United States is a nation of immigrants and its laws must be true to that proud heritage. The Senator's pride in the US immigrant heritage is mirrored by our pride in the contribution made by generations of Irish emigrants to developments in the US. We strongly support the introduction of proposals that would allow the undocumented Irish currently in the US to continue this tradition in an open and transparent fashion. I commend this motion to the House.

It is an important motion for our emigrants abroad and Fine Gael treat this as a very significant matter. The party leader sees this area as sufficiently important to justify the creation of a portfolio for it on the Front Bench and I am gratified that he has asked me to handle it.I have spent much time on this issue over the last few months and, along with Dáil colleagues, have visited England and America. I do not want to be political in this matter, but the Government has a poor enough record, based on my observations of the conditions of Irish immigrants in America. I will come back to this in a minute.

He will get credit where it is due and vice versa.At various times over the years the Government has tried to put a figure on the number of undocumented Irish in America. Sometimes we are told it is 5,000 and at other times it is supposed to be 50,000. Nobody really knows. However, based on anecedotal evidence we heard when Deputies McGinley, Ring, Coveney and I visited as a Fine Gael delegation earlier in this year, the figure is closer to 50,000 than to 5,000. While there, I found a widespread fear among the young undocumented Irish concerning the possibility of deportation, thereby causing the break up of families, loss of income and many other related problems.It is important that the Government and the relevant Minister avail of every channel and opportunity to talk to as many members of the US Senate and Congress as possible to help with the implementation of the Kennedy-McCain immigration proposals as a matter of urgency. Despite the fact that these proposals were first introduced last May, the committee dealing with this subject in the US Congress has only looked at them briefly, for a variety of reasons. Appointments to the Supreme Court and other matters have intervened to keep this vital legislation on the back burner.My contacts on Capitol Hill indicate that there should be some movement next month or the month after that, as the Minister has said. I take at face value the fact that the original view of both Senators Kennedy and McCain and their staff was that the legislation may be wrapped up by December 2006. I am not sure this timetable will stand. What is the Minister's information in that regard?During our visit to the United States I found that apart from the war in Iraq no issue attracts the attention of ordinary citizens more than immigration. Every major television network including CNN and Fox News continually carried top stories concerning immigration issues. Regardless of whether there are 20,000 or 50,000 of them, the Government must ensure the plight of undocumented Irish people in the United States is not lost in the raging US debate on immigration with its particular emphasis on 1 million Mexicans who cross into the US every year. While the majority of the many politicians we met on Capitol Hill, in particular those with Irish connections, were most anxious to help our case, nevertheless, many of them believed Ireland did not have a problem and other countries presented a bigger problem. It is important, therefore, to continue to lobby US politicians.During our visit politicians and ordinary citizens displayed great goodwill towards Irish people living in the United States. We met several businessmen and lawyers in New York who opposed deportation of Irish people under any circumstances. With their language and work skills Irish workers are regarded as the jewel in the crown of US labour markets. The United States, however, has an unusually badly regulated immigration policy which, apart from some minor adjustments, has not been changed for years. We found that some right-wing politicians want to deport illegal immigrants immediately and as Deputies will be aware as well as the Kennedy-McCain Bill a rival Bill has been introduced in Congress. We can rest assured it is not without its supporters.The undocumented Irish in the United States require the protection of US law before they can come forward to the immigration authorities. No undocumented Irish person will go near the authorities unless and until the new proposals are signed into law. This is a reasonable approach. Of all the nationalities in the United States, the Irish are most likely to meet the criteria of the proposed legislation. Not only are most of them in well paid jobs but many of them are employers whose skills are urgently required in the economy. Some commentators believe a special amnesty similar to the Bruce Morrison visa scheme should be introduced. However, the impact of the attacks on 11 September 2001 on ordinary citizens means no amnesty of any description will be introduced.I thank the American ambassador and his staff for their help. I also thank the special unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is working extremely well, the Bishop of Derry, Dr. Seamus Hegarty, and Fr. Alan Hillard for their great work on this issue. I hope Deputies will be given much more time to discuss this critical issue in future because I could speak for an hour on its many facets. I sincerely hope the parties will co-operate to engineer such a lengthy debate on behalf of every Irish citizen living in the United States, Britain or elsewhere.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	244	While I welcome this debate, two hours is insufficient time to discuss the issue of undocumented Irish immigrants in the United States. My slot has suddenly been cut from 15 to seven minutes because of the level of demand to speak on the matter. At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs earlier in the year I raised the treatment meted out to some undocumented Irish people when apprehended by the authorities in the United States. I wish to place on record the co-operation the joint committee received from the United States ambassador when he appeared before us to outline the difficulties arising from undocumented Irish in the US and the options available to address them. As a result of advice received, a delegation from the committee visited the United States in June.I propose to list the groups we met during our visit because of the excellent work they do and the great insight they gave us into the seriousness of the problem. They were: the Emerald Isle Immigration Center; the New York Irish Center in Long Island City; the Aisling Irish Community Center in Yonkers; the Project Irish Outreach of Catholic charities; the Irish Immigration Pastoral Center in Philadelphia; and a large cross-section of politicians and administrators in Washington.While I welcome the advent of the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Bill, introduced by Senators Ted Kennedy and John McCain, and a similar Act introduced by the House of Representatives, the Kolbe-Flake-Gutierrez Bill, I accept the considerable difficulties the legislation faces. I was told, perhaps by an overly pessimistic individual, that the McCain-Kennedy Bill was "DOA". When I asked what this meant, I was informed it means "dead on arrival". I am more optimistic and hope that, having gone before the Judiciary Committee in July, these Bills will proceed to a successful conclusion. All sides support the motion before us. If introduced, the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act would be a welcome development which would give new hope, security and peace of mind to many Irish people in the United States and their concerned families at home.As Deputy Connaughton noted, as many as 50,000 undocumented Irish people live in the United States. This group is in a deeply difficult position and includes many people who have set down roots in the US over ten or 20 years, established businesses and had families. They are now waiting for a knock on the door that will result in deportation. I was approached by a family in Cork who had to return to Ireland because of a family crisis and, unable to return, now finds its business in the United States in ruins. The undocumented Irish in America face major difficulty accessing services or even obtaining essential documentation such as driving licences but the main area of concern we encountered on our visit was the problem of travelling home to Ireland in times of family crisis.In discussing the needs of undocumented Irish people in the United States we should also consider our responsibility to those Irish people who emigrated many decades ago. While I acknowledge the support the Minister is giving to Irish organisations in the United States, we must acknowledge that many of the Irish emigrants who helped keep Ireland afloat during the darkest of dark days now live in poverty-stricken old age in British and American cities. We have a moral duty to these people, many of whom kept their families and entire villages afloat by sending money and postal orders in the dark days of the past. They stood by us when we needed them; it is our turn to stand by them. The Government must not forget the responsibility we owe them and should fully implement the report of the task force on emigrants without further delay.While none of us disputes the right of the United States to set its own immigration requirements, especially in light of the events of 11 September 2001, increased security in the US has posed major difficulties for many Irish people living there. Between 2000 and 2004, 270 Irish people were deported from the United States. The relationship between Ireland and America has been built on mutual respect earned by the millions of Irish emigrants who helped build that great country.I attach a short note of realism here, there are major difficulties. As Deputy Connaughton stated, there are opponents to the US Act because security is uppermost in people's minds.There is also one element with which I would not agree but which I must put on record. There were a number of people who said to us that they had noted Irish attitudes to US foreign policy and asked why should they do anything for us because of our stance on some issues that the US has taken up. That is a view with which I would not agree but at the same time there exists that element of opposition caused by such statements, some of which are inaccurate and some of which are accurate. That problem is evident and it must be tackled. I would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to bear that in mind in dealing with his counterparts in the United States.I hope the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act will bear fruit despite all the difficulties. All of us, on both sides of the House, have a responsibility to continue our efforts to monitor the passage of the Act through the US House of Representatives and the US Senate. I wish the Minister and his Department the best of luck in his endeavours. We, on this side of the House, will continue our efforts through our informal connections with organisations in the United States and with the US Administration.

As spokesperson of the Labour Party, I welcome this all-party motion. I also join with others in commending the initiatives of Senators Kennedy and McCain of the United States in seeking to address the issue of the out of status or undocumented Irish in the United States. As in previous discussions of United States foreign policy and Irish attitudes, it is one of the best uses of the friendly relations between our countries to be able to speak to each other frankly on every aspect of policy.On this issue of immigration policy, the United States is entitled of course to be concerned about its security, particularly in the wake of the tragic events of 11 September 2001, which we addressed both here in this House and in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. At the same time the reason for the urgency that attaches to the legislation which has made its way through the judicial committee in the United States is the fact that immigration difficulties are exacerbated by the new security measures.The Minister, in his introductory speech on this motion, made some points that are of interest. It is for another day for us to debate the appropriate equivalent response for those who come to Ireland and our attitude towards them. This is a matter which we will take up in strong measure with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at the earliest opportunity.In understanding the nature of migration —  I studied in the United States at the end of the 1960s and taught in the United States in the 1970s — I am appreciative of the connection that exists between our countries at every level.The uncertainty which falls on the Irish out of status in the United States is immense. For example, one must be virtually a non-person. It is not only the high skilled who are involved but those who are working in the construction industry, for example. Frankly, while it is a norm of Irish emigration to the United States that one may be assisted by family and a network of friends and relations, one may also be exploited by the same network as a result of one's out of status and undocumented nature. The cases with which I have dealt reveal that, which is also tragic.It is interesting to note that the great Irish emigration to the United States took place immediately after the Famine. A few hundred people from the west emigrated to the United States before 1847. The pattern of emigration at that stage was circular migration, to Scotland and Britain primarily, but it revealed an important constant in Irish emigration studies, that is, the importance that was attached to contact with family. The dominant kind of emigration pre-Famine was circular seasonal migration, the rewards of which were used to pay rents, etc., which continually rose as the receipts from agricultural production in Scotland were raised.After the Famine, the great emigration to the United States opened up. The Minister commented on the emigration to the US in the 1950s. I would contest his figure of 400,000 emigrants for the 1950s. Between 1955 and 1960, over 250,000 left Ireland, primarily for England. In one year 58,000 people left. They were mostly of an agricultural background and from rural areas. The males emigrated primarily to the construction industry and helped build Britain. The females entered the services, particularly nursing. Although it is for a debate on another day, theirs was a pattern of greater entry into British society.The 1980s emigrants to which the Minister referred were primarily from urban areas. Most of the people concerned had second level education and many had third level education, and they were more dispersed in the choice of occupations.The undocumented Irish in the United States is a 1980s problem that has been growing. Some of those in contact with the immigration centres are people who have been in the United States a long time. I need not go into the detail of the risks, which involve, for example, one's relationship to the welfare system such as it exists in different states, to the health services primarily, and particularly to the attachment, which Irish people have had even in an age of technological development, to contact with home. Circular migration was the predominant form of Irish migration until the modern period. The notion of once and for all saying goodbye occurred for a limited period in Irish emigration history.Deputy Allen made an interesting point. The Irish remained in contact with their American relatives much more than with their Australian relatives. The emigrants into the cities of the United States sent home money in the American letter. In Liam O'Flaherty's story, The Letter, the father opens the letter, takes out the money and says, before he reads the details of how his son is getting on, there is the price of a horse in that. The Irish, on the other hand, did not keep up communication with their relatives in Australia. I suspect it had something to do with there being nothing in the envelope except an account of how they were getting on in the agricultural setting, in sheep farming, etc., in rural areas.I say all of this to highlight that emigration is a central feature of the Irish experience. However, it is also about vulnerability. It is about making one's way out of one system and into another and fully participating positively. It is a constant in Irish history. For that reason it is something from which we should learn. We should take to heart President Kennedy's comment, quoted by the Minister, on the richness of the contribution of immigration into a society and it should inform our own decisions on family reunification for those who come here.We should remember that in our own commission on immigration, set up by the 1948-51 Government, we laid a stress on economic reasons. It was a rather weak model of the push and pull factors arising at the time. It was an inadequate model, ignoring the circular nature of emigration, to which I referred mentioned, which had already started after the Second World War.I am grateful for the interest that the current American ambassador to Ireland has taken in this matter, his attendance at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and also his helpful nature in dealing with the proposed legislation. My office has also been in touch frequently with Senator Kennedy's office.It is interesting that another group of people, the 42 families who fled Montserrat after the eruption of the volcano, would benefit from this legislation. Others, not only the Irish, would benefit. I suppose this is the reason in the other House Mr. Gutierrez, for example, is taking an interest, presumably informed by his connections with the Latin American community in the United States.I join those who paid tribute to the Irish Episcopal Commission and the emigration centres. While I am a critic of some aspects of current practice in the Department of Foreign Affairs, I welcome the Minister's announcement of increased funding for the immigration centres. I hope we can debate more fully another day the matter of making full funding available for the implementation of the task force on immigration.It is interesting to bear in mind the alternatives to this important legislation. The message that should go out from this House is that there is unanimous support for the preferred legislation of Senators Kennedy and McCain, that it is something to which we attach urgency and it is our strong belief, while understanding the manner in which circumstances have changed in the United States, that people who are important to us have already suffered by long periods of detention, deportation and by much exacerbated feelings of vulnerability of being unable to retain contact with their relatives and families.The alternative of securing residency in the United States through the means of the diversity visa lottery programme, for example, is not realistic. Fate does not favour us, with a result of 290 out of 9.5 million applicants. The statistical projection from that would not impact on the need in relation to the current volume of out of status Irish persons. It will be valuable when we are, perhaps now on the final date of the legislation, able to establish more authoritative estimates for the number of people involved. I believe that number was never as low as 5,000. Decades ago it was twice that figure taking the rough estimates prepared not just for those on the east coast, but those on the west coast in California and wherever. The best base line figure is probably the estimate from the immigration centres, adjusted downwards. I appreciate there is a difficulty in obtaining an accurate figure as people are reluctant to come forward because through giving information they place themselves at risk.When I hear of the comparative efforts being made to deal with the problem of illegal immigration, there is a lesson in it for us all. Perhaps we should debate more fully in this House our general attitude and policy towards migration which is one of the features of the modern world. I studied in this area almost 40 years ago. Over the past decades during which I lectured on this area, matters changed fundamentally. The speed of capital and labour have changed relative to each other. Capital has become more mobile and virtually moves in real time while the movement of labour is full of the social and psychological costs and consequences associated with leaving one system and entering another.It is, perhaps, appropriate that we should debate the international commission on migration and the issue of migrant's rights. The Kennedy-McCain legislation is in the general atmosphere of according rights to those who make a productive contribution to the economy. We have lessons to learn with regard to the families of people who make incipient moves towards becoming part of the economy. We should draw from our experience. We should not use offensive and insulting language, as some Cabinet Members have done, for example, in saying people's stories at airports were "cock and bull stories" and one wished one could turn them back. I cannot convey how much those of us who have worked for three or four decades on immigration issues were grieved to hear such statements made by a person here. The Irish abroad is a new unit in the Department with a small staff. It is an excellent development and I hope it gets more resources and the extra staff it needs.I am glad to be able to support this initiative which will be widely welcomed, particularly by parents here who have made contact with Deputies on all sides of the House on the issue. This pressure has been intense over the past few years. To those who may read our words on this matter, may they take into account that this is not an ordinary motion, but one debated in special circumstances. There is a huge increase in the number of people expressing anxiety on the matter, parents, relatives and people who must remain quite circumspect who receive telephone calls to do with information on their families.I am interested in this area. Even when I was legally in the United States as a postgraduate student and a university teacher, I met people whose worry was that they would have an accident, have to go to hospital or to come out, as it were, of the dark shadows of the out of status and undocumented existence in which they were. For all of those reasons, I have great pleasure in supporting this motion on behalf of the Labour Party.

This measure, if passed, could have positive and life-changing consequences for undocumented workers living in the United States, thousands or tens of thousands of whom are Irish. Three weeks ago, my colleague, Deputy Crowe, expressed our support for the reform Bill directly to the two American Senators, along with the rest of the all-party delegation, in Capitol Hill, Washington.The situation of the undocumented Irish living in the United States has been of major concern to Sinn Féin for many years. Our concern centres around the vulnerability of this isolated group of Irish citizens. In particular, we lament the effective exile of this group from Ireland and their families here. This exile results from the real fear that if they were to return here for a visit, holiday, wedding or funeral, they would be unable to re-enter the United States where they have built a life, albeit an uncertain one. It is also likely that this intolerable situation contributes to substance misuse, suicide and depression among undocumented workers. We all know friends or relatives who travelled to the United States in the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s and have heard their harrowing stories of avoiding detection and trying to build a life.Má rithear Bille Kennedy-McCain, déanfaidh sé mórán chun an cás seo a leigheas. Is ceart agus cuí dá réir go dtacaíonn muid leis an chéim thábhachtach seo atáá glacadh ag an mbeirt Seanadóirí agus an bheirt ó Theach na nIonadaithe.I would also like to use this rare opportunity of Oireachtas enlightened consensus and goodwill around a positive immigration reform to push for a similar measure here. Members of the Oireachtas should not promote the introduction of an immigration policy in another jurisdiction that they would not be prepared to introduce here.In the same way we have expressed empathy en masse with the undocumented Irish in the United States, let us do the same with regard to undocumented workers here. Sinn Féin calls on the Government to introduce a system to regularise undocumented migrants here. This system should, in line with recommendations of the Immigrant Council of Ireland, prioritise the human rights of such people and recognise that the vast majority are involuntary migrants desperately seeking work, as so many Irish have done abroad before them.This type of immigration policy reform is vitally necessary to bring an end to the exploitation of this group by some unscrupulous employers in the State and to meet the legitimate needs and the right of migrants to maintain real contact with their respective families at home. A failure to introduce such reform would amount to nothing short of hypocrisy.I welcome the opportunity provided by this motion to support the Kennedy-McCain legislation, which has real potential to improve the current insupportable circumstances of many Irish people in the United States of America. I look forward to the day when those who wish to return to Ireland, albeit on a temporary basis, can do so. I look forward to the day when they can access and be covered by health insurance. I look forward to the day when they can sleep easily, without the fear of being hauled off to a prison pending deportation. I look forward to the day when they can pay taxes officially on foot of their labours and benefit fully from such contributions. Many of the people to whom I refer have contributed greatly to the US economy, but are not reaping the benefits of their contributions in terms of pensions etc., which they deserve. I hope the proposed US legislation will be passed by the US House of Representatives and the US Senate. I hope the Members of this House will soon be able to congratulate the US authorities on their enlightened view of this matter.Guím rath ar an reachtaíocht seo agus orthu siúd atá tar éis é a chur chun cinn — an Seanadóir Edward Kennedy, an Seanadóir John McCain, an tIonadaí James T.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	247	The Green Party is very happy to be associated with the motion. Like all parties, the Green Party has very strong ties with the United States. My colleagues, Deputies Cuffe and Boyle, are American citizens, like many other Irish people. Many of the Green Party's researchers, including two researchers in my office, are American citizens. The Green Party employs excellent and hard-working interns from Massachusetts every year. My brother, who has been settled with his family in the United States for many years, has told me all about the undocumented Irish in the US.The Minister of Foreign Affairs is aware that I have been a harsh critic of the Bush Administration in recent years. I opposed the senseless war in Iraq. My worst fears and those of many people who opposed the war have been confirmed. We should never mistake criticism of American foreign policy and the Bush Administration with anti-Americanism. If all those who criticise George W. Bush are seen as anti-American, I am afraid that many Americans can be classed as anti-American.Like most people in this country, I have a special affinity with the United States. When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, I had the great pleasure of going to the United States, at the invitation of the then US ambassador, Ms Jean Kennedy Smith. I would like to acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of the current US ambassador. I was accompanied on my visit to the United States, which was organised to solidify the peace process, by the then Lord Mayor of Belfast, Mr. Hugh Smith of the PUP. It was an amazing experience to visit the Irish centres in many American cities. It is probable that many of the people I met were undocumented. I was pleased to see the ties in action and to enjoy the warmth with which we were received. I have always said that the members of the Kennedy family do not just have an affinity with Ireland — they see themselves as Irish. That is why Senator Edward Kennedy has taken such an interest in this process.When I visited the Queens district of New York with my brother, I spoke to many Irish people who found themselves in the form of limbo that has been mentioned. I was conscious that it was a difficult and stressful set of circumstances for them. I hope the legislation that is currently before the US Congress will alleviate many of the stresses encountered by such people. I hope they will no longer have to hide and worry about their futures.It is fair to say that Ireland has depended on immigration in recent years. That was the main theme of the contribution to this debate by Deputy Michael D. Higgins. If one casts one's mind back to the 1980s, one will recall that the worst thing that could be said to students participating in demonstrations was that if they did not watch themselves — if they continued to participate in demonstrations — they might not get a visa to get into the United States. I know only too well that such threats were used by members of the Garda Síochána. It demonstrates the extent to which this country depended on its young people being able to get into the US.I note the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is in attendance. I recall that his father, the late Brian Lenihan, once said that Ireland was too small to accommodate all its people and that it was a good idea for people to get out of the country. We no longer find ourselves in that situation, luckily. Many people went to the US in the 1980s.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I am delighted to have the opportunity to support this motion. I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for proposing it. I acknowledge the role of the Ceann Comhairle and various other Deputies representing all parties, who have kept the plight of the undocumented Irish to the forefront by travelling to the United States to make their case. I have travelled to the US to that end on two occasions. Like other Members, I have been delighted by the level of support for the undocumented Irish that has been indicated by members of the US Congress. We are all aware of the hardship faced by people whose loved ones in the United States find it difficult to attend family events such as funerals and weddings. The difficulties to which I refer are brought most into focus on such occasions. The legislation being debated in the US at present is most important for that reason.I greatly regret the cavalier attitude to the US in certain quarters, particularly since the events of 11 September 2001 and in the context of the Iraq war. The small group of people who display the attitude to which I refer seems to get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I do not think the attitude in question is positive in any way. We should acknowledge the US Administration's huge support for the Northern Ireland peace process over recent decades. Similarly, we need to reflect on the importance of the huge level of foreign direct investment in this country. As the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, pointed out earlier, there is now a two-way process of investment, as many Irish companies are establishing operations and employing substantial numbers of people in the US. That undoubtedly arises from the progress made due to foreign direct investment in this country by US companies.I was honoured to represent the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, at the annual general meeting of the Irish Episcopal Commission on Emigrants in Washington. I acknowledge the wonderful support work undertaken by Bishop Hegarty and Fr. Alan Hillard and others on the US front, particularly the work done by the Irish emigrant centres. I had the opportunity on that occasion to meet many of their representatives, as did the other Oireachtas Members with us. One would have to be enormously impressed by the quality of their work and the range of demands on their services. We tended to emphasise the plight of the undocumented Irish but many other difficulties beset the Irish community there, to some of which the Minister referred in his speech. The work of the centres is very important.I am delighted funding for emigrants is now eight times what it was in 1997. I was very impressed by the work of the Irish abroad unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy and consulates in the US. I had reason on occasion to make representations on specific cases. The level of support I received from our people in the US was extraordinary and went far beyond what would reasonably be seen as the call of duty. It is important this is acknowledged in the House.In a debate such as this we must also acknowledge the role of the friends of Ireland in Congress, and their understanding of the difficulties which beset the undocumented Irish. I acknowledge the past work of Congressmen Morrison and Donnelly with regard to visas but also the ongoing advice and support of others. We are all aware of the difficulties which arise in regard to, for example, driving licences or tighter border security. Hardly a Member of the House has not been contacted by a constituent arising from difficulties in this area. However, the House must also acknowledge that it is a difficult climate for reform in the United States, a point which should not be made light of. Every effort should be made in the House and elsewhere to speak and act in support of the Kennedy-McCain Bill. We also acknowledge the support of President Bush and his generous response to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the last St. Patrick's Day celebrations in regard to the difficulties of the undocumented Irish.Ultimately, this legislation, like legislation in any Parliament, will be amended and examined in great detail. We could be more proactive in one area, namely, in encouraging those in Congress who have fears in regard to immigration issues to take a more positive view of the Kennedy-McCain Bill. This is one of the great challenges. Many US politicians, particularly post 9/11, have concerns in this area. We need to do all we can to ensure those concerns are addressed.With regard to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it is clearly in our economic interest that we continue to support and be positive towards foreign direct investment which, fortunately, now moves in both directions. It is important for our economy that a message is sent. As a number of Deputies opposite stated, it is also important that our policy in this area reflects what we demand of others.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion, which came about specifically as a result of a visit of an all-party Oireachtas delegation to the US, led by the Ceann Comhairle. Among the issues raised, the most pressing issue, which arose time and again, was that of the undocumented Irish in the US. In particular, we discussed the issue with Senator John McCain, who had a thorough understanding of the problem, not only from the American perspective but from an Irish perspective and with a knowledge of the issues and problems it causes here. Having discussed it, the last point he made was that this US legislation needs support, including from Ireland.I thank the Minister for his support and I am grateful for the full co-operation of all parties and the Whips in organising this debate — it is rare one sees such co-operation in this House. The undocumented Irish living in the US is often seen as a rural issue. However, as a Dublin Deputy, I know many families in Clondalkin and Lucan who rarely talk about this subject because they are afraid that if they speak to the wrong person, their son or daughter living abroad will be in some way compromised. This causes real difficulties. Aside from ordinary occasions such as Christmas or weddings, people can no longer travel home for critical events such as illnesses or funerals. It is a real issue that affects everybody. Every Member of the House has many constituents who are affected. However, it is an issue that people will not discuss publicly because they are afraid of compromising their position.The US is prepared to deal with the issue and feels it must do so. However, it is not just considering this from an Irish perspective. The matter must be dealt with as it is estimated that up to 13 million undocumented people live in the US, a situation the Americans view primarily as a security risk. It is important this motion is debated because other legislation is contemplated, apart from that proposed by Senators Kennedy and McCain, that would be not be as positive from an Irish perspective. Having spoken to Senators and Congressmen of different persuasions, I feel there is a real willingness to deal with this legislation; I believe the Bill will be passed.The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, referred to the Bill being amended. However, it is important that we realise there is a significant number of undocumented residents in the US. The US Administration is quite blunt in stating there will not be an amnesty. Instead, there will be a method of progression for those currently in the US illegally in which they will apply for visas while there. Not all of the other Bills proposed would offer that opportunity. This is why it is important we, united in the House, fully support the Kennedy-McCain Bill with this aspect fully intact, namely, that those who are undocumented and currently illegal must be allowed the opportunity to regularise their situation from within the US. If that core issue is not addressed, these people will not come forward and the problem will continue forever. Not all other politicians in the US — Senators and Congressmen — necessarily agree with this point. However, it is critically important we emphasise this because the Irish in the US will not participate in the scheme if they must leave the country first.I fully support the motion. I compliment my colleagues of all parties and both Houses who travelled on the recent trip to the US. We made good and telling points that were listened to by those we met.

However, I would like to sound a word of caution. Many Irish mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, and aunts and uncles are very worried about this situation. I do not want a false message to go out that this legislation is actually happening.I welcome the US ambassador. He visited my county of Mayo last week. He has a connection with Mayo and I know he enjoyed his stay there. I am glad to see him. I say to him that given all the previous ambassadors and US Presidents with Irish connections, it amazes me that a situation ever arose whereby Irish people were not allowed to enter the US. Irish people built America — they built the roads and did all the dirty work. When my grandfather died, he was buried with the American flag. His brother died in 1921 and received a State funeral because he helped to set up the State. My grandfather was proud to have the American flag with him. That was his wish, which was honoured by the Embassy, which sent the flag. Many of my aunts and uncles are buried in America, which they loved, as I do. However, it amazes me that the people of a small country like Ireland never had free passage into the US, as we have into Britain. However, we must deal with the existing situation.There is a problem in America, whether people like it or not. Irish-American politicians are not sure about this legislation and have not yet committed themselves to supporting it. This is a very political issue in America because there are between 14 million and 15 million Mexicans in that country. As the previous speakers said, there will not be an amnesty and the legislation will have to cover all sections of society in America.I was glad Deputies Connaughton, McGinley, Coveney and I went to America at our own expense where we met people from Fianna Fáil. I am glad that at last the Irish Government considers this to be a very serious problem, that our citizens abroad must be protected and that we cannot simply forget about them when they go to America or any other part of the world. One thing that can be said about the American Government is that when its citizens face a problem, no matter what part of the world they are in, it deals with it. It looks after its own citizens and it is only right that our Government and agencies look after our citizens.I come from a county that experienced much emigration. There is no doubt but that many of my constituents are in America illegally. I hope this legislation will be passed. I ask the American ambassador and the Irish Government to keep lobbying Irish-American politicians to make sure this legislation is passed. A mother in my county has not seen her son for seven years. She has cancer and she knows she will not be around too long. She is no longer able to go to the United States of America, although she used to go every year to see her son, daughter-in-law and their child. She is no longer able to go because of illness. She knows she might never see her son again. A woman visited my constituency office whose husband died last November but her son could not return home for his father's funeral because he knew if he did, he would not get back into America. She is afraid she will die and that her son will not be able to return for her funeral. This situation must be dealt with.America has always been good to Ireland, and Ireland has been good to America. There has been much criticism of America in the past but I have not criticised America. America has created much employment here. In the town from which I come, 1,000 people are employed in an American company which has been there for more than 30 years. It has been a good employer and it has been good for the town and the country.As the previous speaker said, it is important that when this legislation is passed by the US Senate, Irish citizens will not have to come home and that whatever documentation or paperwork is required is dealt with in America. People are afraid that if they are sent home, they will not get back into the United States of America. These people are not in America because they have to be. They are there because they want to be. They love America. It has become their home and it is where they want to bring up their children. They are not there for economic reasons and that is why I hope this Bill is passed quickly, that our people can be dealt with as speedily as possible and that this situation will never arise again. I believe this is the last legislation that will deal with emigration to America, particularly for the Irish.I hope the Irish Government will deal fairly with the immigration problem we have here. We cannot be hypocritical and have it both ways. We cannot ask the American ambassador and American Government to look after our citizens without trying to deal with the immigration problem we have and not run away from it.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. I have taken a very active interest in the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US since the mid-1980s. In 1987 I paid a private visit to New York to meet Irish emigration groups there. I paid a further visit in 1989 with the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Peter Barry, to New York and Washington where we met people such as Congressman Donnelly and Senator Edward Kennedy. I have paid numerous visits to the USA since then, mostly to do industrial promotion for my constituency and to attend fund-raising events for local projects. However, I have rarely visited the USA without meeting an undocumented Irish person, whether in New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, San Jose and other cities.The undocumented Irish are scattered right across the 48 states of the USA. The US has an undocumented population of between 18 million and 20 million — a population that lives and works mostly underground for fear of detection and subsequent deportation. Until there is some form of immigration reform which legitimises the undocumented population, America will never know who these 18 million to 20 million people are as they will not come forward to be counted. It is difficult to estimate the undocumented Irish population for the same reason. Based on the evidence provided by the Irish services agencies across the US, we can only estimate that there are 50,000 undocumented Irish living there. The figure may be lower but it may be a great deal higher.Since 11 September 2001, the US has become more security conscious. The introduction of legislation such as the Patriot Act and the Real ID Act to make its borders secure has made life very difficult for the undocumented in that country. For example, the Real ID Act prohibits federal agencies from accepting, for any official purposes, state-issued identification cards or driver licences that do not meet numerous minimum documented requirements, including verification of immigration status.We all agree the US needs to protect and secure itself against future terrorism threats. However, immigration legislation needs to be differentiated from the security debate as they are two distinct issues.The US immigration system is broken; this is an indisputable fact. It does not work for employers, employees and families. The Kennedy-McCain proposal is an important step towards creating a more equitable immigration regime in the US. This initiative, in tandem with the current restructuring efforts within the US citizen and immigration services, can provide a US immigration system that keeps the US safe and secure while at the same time treats its immigrants fairly.Apart from the Kennedy-McCain proposal, there are further proposals such as the Sheila Jackson Lee proposal and the Kyl-Cornyn proposal mentioned by the Minister. However, they do not go as far as the Kennedy-McCain proposal which is far more suitable from an Irish point of view. That is why all sides of the House support that proposal.A recent nationwide survey in America showed that American voters support a system that combines toughness with fairness, provides a path to citizenship with reasonable requirements, implements an effective guest worker programme and reunites families. Voters want a system that rewards immigrants who come to work hard and pay taxes. That is the clear message from American voters. Our clear message to our friends on Capitol Hill is that we want a fair system to look after the undocumented Irish in America. I am glad the House has spoken with one voice — a rare occasion — in calling for this initiative to be put in place immediately.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I wish to share my time with Deputies Hoctor and Carty.Like other speakers I am delighted to welcome this important motion and the all-party agreement it has received. Members on all sides are to be complimented. The Taoiseach, along with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, started the ball rolling on 17 March when they met President Bush in the White House and flagged this issue as a priority for both our countries to examine. It is fair to say progress has been pretty quick since then.I was proud to represent my party at the Conference of the Irish Apostolate in the United States earlier this year, as were Members from other parties who worked equally hard. I had the opportunity to visit Capitol Hill quite recently on an all-party delegation led by the Ceann Comhairle. It was a most beneficial trip with successful meetings with Senator McCain whose Bill, co-sponsored by Senator Ted Kennedy, is the subject of this debate. I compliment the Irish diplomatic corps in the US and the Irish ambassador to the US, Mr. Noel Fahey. The Irish apostolate in the US also played a large role, particularly Fr. Hilliard who attended the House earlier this morning and the US ambassador, Mr. Kenny, who has shown a keen interest in the matter and has been helpful and co-operative.In the Limerick West constituency, no different from any other, I have been lobbied, like my colleagues, by mothers, fathers and siblings of undocumented Irish emigrants in the US. They have lobbied me because of the sheltered lives their sons and daughters must live in the US, with their movements restricted within the US and not being able to leave for weddings, funerals and other family events in Ireland. This is difficult for these individuals. It must be recognised these people have played a large part in building the US. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated:These people work hard. They contribute positively to their communities and to their adopted country. They rightly take pride in their achievements. They are anxious to have the opportunity to come out of the shadows and regularise their status. They deserve our support and the support of the Irish people.I agree with other Members that the way to make progress on this issue is through the McCain-Kennedy Bill. I support the comments of Deputy Ring when he says we must, however, exercise caution. While Senators McCain and Kennedy, Congressman Walsh and others are supportive of this legislation, there are many others in both US Houses who need to be convinced that this is a problem affecting Irish people and the legislation the only solution for them.If adopted it will open a route for legality for undocumented Irish emigrants. It will regularise their status by allowing them apply for a temporary residency visa. They can then receive work and travel authorisation, coming out the shadows to enjoy greater peace of mind. Significantly, they could travel to and from Ireland without fear of being refused re-entry to the US. They would enjoy greater protection in the workplace and be eligible for health insurance. These proposals would be the ideal solution. However, as we may not get this, we must be cautious. We must work as best we can, continuing our lobbying to ensure these people can be documented and their lives can be changed.

It is of tremendous significance to many families across the island. Illegal Irish emigrants have been working hard in contributing to the US economy but are not in a position to gain legal status without tremendous costs for lawyers and others over long periods.I compliment the Ceann Comhairle, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister and Minister of State, the US ambassador, Mr. Kenny, and the Irish ambassador to the US, Mr. Noel Fahey, and all others who have worked on this issue.

If this is out of protocol, I am happy to withdraw my remarks.Those involved in this matter must be complimented for the work done. The media often sneer at Members for the value of their trips abroad. This has been one of tremendous merit where we will see results. However, it must be treated with caution. The importance of the work done by the emigration centres in the urban centres of the US must also be acknowledged. Priests, religious people and others involved in these centres, diocesan and Government funded, have worked with the illegal Irish emigrants over many years, providing advice and support when none was available because of their illegal status. The issue of medical care has always been one of anxiety for illegal emigrants in the US. While working on building sites and so forth, the greatest fear is that medical cover would not be granted to them because of their status.The breakthrough in legislation with the McCain-Kennedy Bill, which hopefully will be partnered successfully with the Oireachtas, will provide what is needed for illegal emigrants to return home to Ireland at their own discretion. All Members gave examples of people sparing their visits to Ireland in the hope that relatives here will live forever but in their devastation, they return for a family funeral, never to have the opportunity to return to America. This has been a dilemma for those who have contributed to the US economy. I am delighted America is standing by us on this issue. We welcome the efforts of Senators Kennedy and McCain who have made the most positive proposals for Ireland. We must see every effort is made to work with them and their proposals accepted.
#JohnCartyFF	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-party	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	264	As a Member representing County Mayo, a county ravaged by emigration, I welcome the McCain-Kennedy Bill. I compliment both Senators and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in their efforts to secure legal status for undocumented Irish emigrants in the US. It would be remiss of me not to mention the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the not often mentioned US Senator from Nebraska, Chuck Hagel, who both did tremendous work in this area.I have more cousins in the US than in Ireland, from Chicago to Ohio, from Philadelphia to Boston. Anywhere I go in the US, I always meet up with a cousin. On several visits to the US, I have met those young Irish people, many neighbours of mine, who are there undocumented and illegally. It is a great source of worry to them that they cannot come home to visit their parents. Recently, two individuals from my parish were deported when they attempted to re-enter the US after visiting Ireland. It was tragic that they could not even return to pick up their personal belongings. The undocumented also dread what lies ahead of them if they ever fall ill.It is tragic they must go through this process. I welcome the proposal in the McCain-Kennedy Bill that the undocumented should not have to return to Ireland to regularise their status but should do so in the US. They have made a huge contribution to the US economy in many fields. Some even own their own businesses. They have always paid their taxes and yet they are not there on a legal basis. It is unfortunate that this situation exists. I ask Members with relatives and connections to politicians in the US to lobby them to give this Bill their full support.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Significant changes need to be introduced in US immigration laws with regard to Irish citizens in the US under the visa waiver programme, VWP. A large number of people from County Sligo, illegally in the US, cannot return home with no sense of compassion or consideration given to them. The VWP enables Irish citizens to remain in the States for 90 days but not to secure employment locally. The provision for individuals on holidays under the VWP to transfer to another category is extremely limited. The US President, Mr. Bush, has proposed a new form of temporary work permits which would be available to both undocumented Irish emigrants in the US and those seeking to enter the US to take up pre-arranged employment. This is critically important and has been discussed for some time. It is time the level of involvement between Ireland and the US, going back to the American Civil War in which more than 200,000 Irish people gave their lives, is rightly recognised when the undocumented Irish citizens in America are considered.The US Senators Tom Daschle and Senator Chuck Hagel have announced a bipartisan plan for immigration reform that would enable undocumented foreign nationals in the US to legalise their status if they fulfil certain conditions. It is important this happens. Senator Edward Kennedy has also introduced a draft immigration reform Bill entitled the Safe, Orderly Legal Visas and Enforcement Act, the SOLVE Act, to provide opportunities for undocumented immigrants to regularise their status.I compliment Deputy Connaughton and other Members for going to Capitol Hill to discus this important issue. All these proposals have been welcomed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as representing genuine efforts to deal with the situation of the undocumented Irish in the US in a constructive and sympathetic way.This matter is now critically important in light of the massive amount of documentation required — rightly so, given the war on terrorism — to enter the United States. However, people living there cannot even get a driving licence and are afraid of being arrested on the street and deported.There are three ways to enter America. The first is through sponsorship by an immediate family member who is a US citizen or lawful permanent resident. The second is through sponsorship by a prospective employer in certain fields, such as for persons of extraordinary ability in the fields of science, business or sporting achievements. The third way is through the diversity lottery programme. Irish citizens can in November of each year apply for a lottery held in the United States. It will again be on offer from November of this year and people can apply for it.I call on Mr. Bush to firm up the proposals he clearly made when he met the Taoiseach. It is equally important that progress be made on Senator Kennedy's proposed SOLVE Act providing opportunities for undocumented people. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is in the Chamber. This motion should be sent directly to President Bush to demonstrate the level of determination on the part of Members from all sides of the House that he should honour his commitment to deal with this matter forthwith. The US President should further this matter on Capitol Hill. The US Senators Tom Daschle, Chuck Hagel and Edward Kennedy have all spoken about this matter and we now need action. Those who are undocumented in America need immediate attention on this issue because sympathy is no longer good enough. Such people have contributed enormously to the benefit and success of America's economy and now need some action.This is important because of the restricted level of opportunities available to undocumented people in America. In some cases they have families there. What is now needed is a level of commitment. Other speakers have already stated that such people should not be obliged to return to Ireland. There should be a temporary facility whereby people could make a declaration. They could then be granted temporary visas. Something must be done to provide them with an opportunity. While programmes such as the green card and lottery schemes obviously provide a unique opportunity to people, many who have won such lotteries in the past now live in Ireland. We must deal with the citizens living in America illegally. I am delighted that the Minister will act on this motion.

While I have not listened in detail to other speakers, as far as I am aware, the McCain-Kennedy Bill is dead and was a non-starter. If Members are pinning any hopes on that legislation, they are mistaken. Efforts should be directed at the US Administration. To the best of my knowledge, the current position is that over the period from June to August, the Administration gave briefings on the immigration issue to a number of Members of the US House of Representatives as well as a number of key Senators. In essence, it was proposed that people who were in America illegally would be obliged to own up to that fact, to pay some kind of fine and to leave America and return to their countries of origin. After a year such people could apply for re-entry but without a guarantee that they would be granted citizenship. This is completely unacceptable.In general, the lobbying efforts made by the Government have been good, but much more could be done in this respect. I have made this point repeatedly to successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs, from Mr. Dick Spring to the current Minister last week. Adequate resources are not being devoted to this issue. I know this because in the last 18 months, six of my constituents have been jailed for considerable lengths of time. They have been chained up, shotguns have been pointed at them and they have been treated very badly. In these cases, I was obliged to call the consulate office and to raise the issue in the Dáil to put pressure on the Government to do something. Opposition Deputies were obliged to raise the issue.The Government did not pay much attention until the issue escalated dramatically and blew up in its face. It then realised that the US immigration department was treating our citizens extremely badly. The seriousness with which the Government takes these issues can be gauged by its softly-softly approach. However, we do not put the requisite efforts into lobbying for illegal undocumented Irish people. It is not being done and the Government's track record over the last year proves it.As for my constituents, I was obliged to approach Congressman Jim Walsh. As recently as last week, he made it clear to me that he would ask the immigration department for a review of all six cases once I supplied the specific details. The Government should have done this. It should ask for such reviews and investigations within the immigration department with regard to its behaviour and the experiences of Irish citizens. However it did not do so.

We have a major stake in this matter because the estimates of undocumented Irish in America range from 5,000 to 50,000 people. As far as the Administration's bid to deal with this problem through legislation is concerned, it is coming up to crunch time. My concern is that considering what the Government has failed to do in the last 18 months——

Undocumented immigrants in the United States continually face numerous problems, of which Members are well aware. Thankfully, US politicians are also becoming familiar with the issue. It is welcome that several Bills are before the US Congress proposing various means of legislating for immigration reform.The plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States was brought to my attention this year when I took the liberty of travelling to the US for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations with members of the local authority in County Donegal. I met many people from Donegal and elsewhere in Ireland, many of whom were friends and neighbours. They outlined their concerns to me as illegal workers in America.The undocumented Irish in the United States, of which there are many, live under very difficult circumstances. They are in a position in which they are constantly watching their backs for fear of being deported back to Ireland, even those who are resident in the country for years. It is well recognised that the Irish, undocumented or not, contribute greatly to the economy in the US and are certainly not reluctant to work and pay their way. The greatest problem facing these people is their inability to travel back and forth to visit their relatives who are quite often elderly parents. They are forced to miss out on many family occasions such as weddings, births, anniversaries and funerals.This situation is not one that will of itself go away and is consequently of the utmost importance to us as politicians here in Ireland. I am very pleased that the US Government is taking such a keen interest in enforcing new legislation regarding the matter. I support the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act as introduced in the US Senate by Senator Edward Kennedy and Senator John McCain and in the US House of Representatives by Representative Jim Kolbe and Representative Jeff Flake.This legislation will greatly improve the living conditions of the undocumented Irish in the United States and also give great consideration to family members of those exiled there. If this legislation is brought into effect, undocumented migrants will be able to apply for either a H-5A or H-5B visa, among others. The H-5A visa will be valid for three years and renewable once with no waiting period between renewals, and will allow an adjustment of status at the end of four years through self-petitioning or at any point through the sponsorship of people's employers. The legislation also contains a provision to allow the families of holders of a H-5A visa to accompany them to the US. It is proposed that 400,000 H-5A visas would be allocated initially subject to an annual review based on demand.The H-5B visa will be valid for three years and renewable once and can be obtained if the migrant can demonstrate that he or she was working without authorisation in the US on 12 May 2005. The migrant will also have to prove that he or she has been paying taxes and has had criminal and security background checks. It will also be necessary to pay application fees and penalties. Those who secure a H-5B visa will be given the opportunity to apply for legal permanent resident status after holding the visa for six years and the payment of a second fine of $1,000.It is of critical importance that the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act as proposed by Kennedy and McCain is adopted into legislation as we have too many fellow Irish men and women living in fear of being deported from the United States. This legislation will give them the best opportunity to regularise their status and permanently lift the constant threat of deportation, thus creating a situation in which these people can continue to contribute to the US economy and communities in which they live and to which they belong.I acknowledge the work done thus far by our Government and by the Minister. I hope he makes every effort to continue the work because much remains to be done on this legislation. He should try to ensure that it goes through sooner rather than later. Enough visas must be issued to cover all Irish emigrants, not just a proportion of them.

I welcome the fact the Government has taken this initiative and assume there will be cross-party support for the current attempt to legalise those who have left here and lived illegally in the US. There was a time when America offered many opportunities that were not available in this country. There may not be the same rush to the US as there once was, but it still leaves people in a predicament when they have been working there and paying taxes yet have not obtained legal status. Such people have not been able to come home, which has had obvious repercussions for themselves and for the loved ones they leave at home. Should they die when in the US, it is often difficult to locate them to bring their bodies home for burial, which is a trauma that nobody wants to experience.I congratulate Senator Kennedy and the many people involved in bringing the issue this far. It has been a major issue in Ireland and we have met many American officials at different stages. Sometimes it looked very positive while at other times things looked very bleak. I hope the emphasis from Ireland will lend some weight in the US to ensure that these proposals become reality.I read Senator Ted Kennedy's remarks on comprehensive immigration reform in July. It is recognised that the immigration system needs to be fixed. The Senator pointed to the exploitation of workers, the division of families, fake documents, criminal smuggling, community tensions and public frustrations that are all linked with this issue. The American people are demanding amendments to a system that is broken. It is very important that we add our voice to the debate and emphasise that we hope the US will deal with this once and for all. In the past, the issue has been polarised between people looking for enforcement and those like ourselves who were looking for more visas. The Senator was right in demanding increased enforcement and increased legalisation at the same time, while pointing out that they are not two opposing principles but can be two sides of the one coin.In the more recent past, the issue has been connected to a greater extent with national security. There was a feeling that national security and immigration reform were inconsistent. However, that is not the case. It is very important to know who is coming into a country. If the people there can be legalised, that helps to deal with national security at the same time. There is also the issue of immigrant workers who are pitted against native workers. To eliminate the culture of illegality that undermines wages and conditions for workers, such an issue must be dealt with.Do we deport everyone or do we legalise everyone? I do not underestimate the process that would need to be undertaken should these reforms be enacted. However, Senator Kennedy made the point that the cost of deporting everybody makes such a scenario unlikely. The Irish have contributed so much to the US. Senator Kennedy stated on 12 May:Immigrants have always been an indispensable part of our nation. They have contributed immensely to our communities. They have created new jobs and whole new industries, served in our armed forces, paid their taxes and help make America the continuing land of promise it is today.It is in the American national interest to deal with the illegality situation and I congratulate Senators McCain, Brownback, Lieberman, Graham and Salazar as well as Congressmen Coble, Flake and Gutierrez who have all been involved in this legislation.Families here have suffered anguish. They have lost people because of the current inability to move fluidly between one place and the other. This legislation is a win-win for all. It should be passed and I commend it to the House.

Outside of subtle nuances, the House is speaking collectively in seeking to resolve this problem. It is a fine line to tread and the matter must be treated with a great deal of sensitivity. One parliament cannot tell another parliament how to go about its business. It is about putting forward a recommendation, informing the debate in that other Chamber and accepting whatever decision is made subsequently. It is not too far out of order to say that of the two Bills before the Congress of the United States, the preferable Bill is the one presented by US Senators Kennedy and McCain.I speak as the only Member of this House who was born in the United States and has the opposite problem of only being able to enter the United States with a US passport, as opposed to people who are Irish citizens who cannot leave the United States unless they have suitable green card and immigration papers in place. As other speakers have said, it must also be recognised that the number of Irish people who find themselves in this situation means there is someone known or related to everyone here because of the circumstances that have evolved. I do not think there is any need to repeat the ongoing history and link between the two countries that demand some type of response.We can be somewhat confident that there is an attempt both at Congress level and with the US Administration to address the issue, and maybe for reasons other than the undocumented Irish. It is possibly the case that President Bush wants to regularise the situation of many Mexicans in the country because of a particular political benefit he might achieve by so doing. If that is the case and it helps Irish people, so much the better.The only negative slant I place on this is that in debating this issue and speaking with one voice, as we will do at the end of the day, we must address the anomalies that exist in our own immigration policy. We lack any type of coherent immigration policy. What exists contains inconsistent elements such as the habitual residence clause that applies especially in regard to social welfare. This is something the Government will probably be forced to remove because of European law.The only other point I would make is that when the legislation is approved in the United States, I hope it does not have a clause that says those who will be entitled to US green cards will have to earn something in the region of $75,000 and more in order to obtain a green card.

Immigration and the undocumented Irish are the big issues for the Irish in the US and those associated with Ireland. I appeal to those who are friends of Ireland to support the Kennedy and McCain Bill. There is not a village, town or city in Ireland where people are not affected by this issue. The message coming from this debate is that the Irish people, North and South, east and west, support the resolution of the issue of the undocumented Irish. We urge people to support the Kennedy and McCain Bill.Speakers referred to the other Bills going through the House on Capitol Hill but the reality is they will not resolve the situation for the undocumented Irish. Between 5 million and 6 million people are affected by this issue in the United States. There has been talk of sending these people back home. Logistically that would be a nightmare for the authorities. The Kennedy and McCain Bill is a way of getting around the difficulties that face the undocumented Irish. I appeal to people, especially those friends who have supported Ireland down through the years, to again make a courageous stand for the undocumented Irish in America and the Irish back home.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I thank all Members who have spoken, particularly those who were constructive in their support. I also thank the parties for the support they have given to this motion.I cannot let the occasion pass without referring to what I regard as an attack on officials, perhaps for political purposes, regarding the way they respond to our citizens abroad. I am astounded at the work rate and assistance that our civil servants, embassy staff and consular staff give around the world at any time of the day or night. We endeavour to act on all cases brought to our attention as best we can. It is not always possible to intervene because of the circumstances of some cases. I regard Deputy Deasy's attack on officials, in particular, as one which may have been motivated by political purposes to get at the Government. No matter what administration is in office the response of the officials remains the same. When the tsunami occurred, staff came into the office on St. Stephen's Day at 12 o'clock in the morning to man the phones, as they did on Sunday last weekend, when the Bali bombing occurred. I do not accept that allegation.Regarding the suggestion that the Kennedy and McCain Bill is dead on arrival, I have heard those comments as well but I do not want to be negative in this regard and I do not think others should be. I accept what people say, that the Bill may not ultimately be accepted. I heard that Senator McCain was asked what we could do by Members of the Oireachtas on an official trip. It was passed on to me by the American ambassador that a conversation had taken place in which Senator McCain said it would be most beneficial if the Oireachtas could pass an all-party motion in support of the Bill. I immediately set matters in train so that this could be put forward.I accept the Bill as drafted may not be the Bill that will ultimately be passed but it contains the type of principles and elements that would help our people. I ask Members to understand that the support of all parties in this Chamber for this Bill will have a dramatic effect on the debate currently taking place. I accept what Deputy Boyle said, that we cannot dictate. I was very conscious of that in the way in which we drafted the motion, which thankfully got all-party support. From now on there will be a serious debate at Congress level in regard to all of these elements.When the Taoiseach and I were in the White House on St. Patrick's Day we raised this issue with President Bush. While people on all sides of the House, in some instances, may criticise President Bush and the American Administration, he portrayed a complete understanding of the issues and a very sympathetic attitude towards the Irish involved, given the relatively small numbers. He indicated that because of the relatively large numbers of all nationalities that it is a big issue with which he wants to deal. I understand that in recent weeks he has been particularly active even though there have been other matters on his agenda in this respect.There was some criticism, perhaps for political purposes, of the perceived lack of effort by the ambassador and staff in America. Nothing could be further from the truth. They are pulling out all the stops in regard to the lobbying of all Senators on a daily basis. One of the difficulties immigrant centres have is that they are not allowed to lobby. It is important that ordinary individuals who have people in America would lobby their particular Congressman and Senator to get the principles and elements of the Kennedy and McCain Bill put forward. In the many opportunities I have had in recent months to go to America on other business, I have always found the time to meet representatives of the Irish emigrant centres. On a recent visit I called all the centres together to one location for the first time to meet me and my officials. We had a very good discussion, not only on the Bill in question but also on other issues, not least of which was the issue of looking after elderly Irish people in America.The ambassador will continue his work in this regard and very much appreciates the support of the Oireachtas for this motion. As I stated, it will be a significant element in recognising the elements of the McCain-Kennedy Bill. I would like to think that when the legislation comes into force, it will contain provisions that will not require our people to return home to apply for a visa. I hope it will in some way give Irish emigrants an opportunity to embark on a path leading to permanent residency.The Fine Gael delegation that was in the United States referred to the issue of an amnesty. Whatever about the McCain-Kennedy Bill, the amnesty was dead from day one. We were told not even to mention it.

I know Fine Gael was told this was the case, as we were on many occasions, by our embassy officials in particular.This is an important day and I regret we do not have more time to discuss this matter. I am open to the possibility of returning to the Chamber as the debate in the United States progresses. Perhaps we could organise this between the Whips. I welcome the all-party support for the Bill. When I contacted all the spokespersons for foreign affairs, who are my counterparts in this matter, each of them was extremely supportive in principle of what we were doing.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I welcome this Bill tentatively. Since the dawn of time a disparity has existed between theory and practice. This truism could be applied to many of the measures set out in the Bill. On the face of it, the changes proposed are desirable and certainly aim to benefit Ireland's criminal justice system. However, while I am not so naive as to believe every Bill enacted in the House is perfect, I feel strongly, in light of the sensitivity of this legislation, that the utmost caution must be exercised before it is passed. Thus, its aims will be reconciled with the eventual outcome in so far as this is possible.I make this point because the Bill deals with a number of delicate issues. The Bill extends a wide range of powers available to the Garda with regard to detainees in particular. It is safe to assume a person in custody is in such circumstances for good reason, but power must be exercised with caution regardless of the circumstances.The Garda Síochána has been in the firing line on a number of occasions in the recent past and it can ill-afford to be accused of abusing any extension of power it is granted, no matter how small the element involved might be. Therefore, each definition contained in the legislation must be ironed out so the scope of our misinterpretation will be as narrow as possible.That we are having this debate in the wake of the passing of the Garda Síochána Bill assists me in my support of this Bill given that we can now look forward to the establishment of a Garda ombudsman commission that will act as a support to the Garda as well as ensuring that it carries out its duties in the most proper fashion. In part, the Bill allows for the collection of personal information of detainees, including saliva samples, which could eventually be used to fill a DNA bank.Today, more than ever, there is a feeling that Big Brother is watching our every move. People are increasingly wary of handing over personal information to any body, official or otherwise. Some say that if one has nothing to hide in respect of one's personal record, one should not be anxious about imparting details if they are of benefit to the State and our personal security. I suppose there is a basic truth in this but, while one might not have anything to hide, this does not eliminate one's right to privacy and dignity.The rights of the individual is a concept that harks back to the Enlightenment, but it rightly remains as burning an issue as it was then, more than 300 years ago. Human rights are under close scrutiny across the globe and, now more than ever, we cannot allow ourselves to be left open to criticism in this regard. Definition is key and I want to be sure the measures in this Bill are both 100% justifiable and enacted to fulfil their express purpose.The issue of justification brings me to the all-pervading topic of anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs. It seems the country has been swept away in a tide of anti-social behaviour. However, how many Members present can provide an adequate definition of the term "anti-social behaviour"? It is a loose term that can be applied to almost any activity of a disreputable nature. The ASBO debate has been extensive in this country. In the United Kingdom, where ASBOs have been in use for six years, a conclusion has yet to be reached as to their effectiveness. In this regard, I must return to the disparity between theory and practice. In theory, ASBOs are an excellent idea as they allow society to deal with low level crime without wasting police time and money. However, I cannot help but feel that anti-social behaviour has become the buzz phrase of the 21st century and ASBOs the eye-catching, hard-hitting solution.How bad are Ireland's anti-social behaviour problems? Are ASBOs really the right tools to deal with it? Anti-social behaviour has become a key issue of concern in the press and in neighbourhoods throughout the country. The basic fear of anti-social behaviour not only has an impact on people's lives but can often blur the boundary between the perception of a crime epidemic and the reality of the circumstances that obtain.A recent survey conducted by the Dublin City Development Board found that 40% of respondents put anti-social behaviour, crime and the general feeling of being unsafe at the top of their concerns. However, anti-social behaviour, crime and feeling unsafe comprise a vast sphere of concerns. Moreover, 50% of those same respondents felt community life in their area had improved in the past ten years. We already have the necessary legislation and bodies in place to deal with the problems we face.When speaking on the Garda Síochána Bill in the House before the summer recess, I emphasised my strong support for the community policing scheme. I argued that joint policing committees and volunteer policing will bring communities and the Garda into closer proximity, thereby enhancing confidence and the feeling of security by allowing a greater sense of partnership and joint responsibility. My research showed this will boost community morale and that, if relations are more closely knit at local level, there is every reason to believe anti-social behaviour will be discouraged. The benefits that this joint policing scheme will bring to our communities, especially in disadvantaged areas, will be all but extinguished if anti-social behaviour orders are introduced. The threat represented by ASBOs will corrode the trust that joint policing will have established between communities and the gardaí, as well as within communities experiencing these problems. When will the joint policing schemes be up and running in our communities? Despite being a TD for Dublin North Central, I have not yet been informed of any initiatives in this regard. I look forward to the speedy implementation of this measure.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in his own explorations into the ways by which others are addressing anti-social behaviour, visited Boston. In that city, Operation Ceasefire, which dates back to the mid-1990s, has been hailed a success in combatting intimidation and nuisance behaviour. This programme was tough on crime but focussed on a new approach to community policing which included greater co-ordination between state agencies and a probation system that stops short of the ASBOs introduced in Britain.We have the requirements in place to establish a similar system in Ireland. We have the legislation beyond the Garda Síochána Act, such as the Children Act 2001 and the Public Order Act 1994, and the necessary State bodies. There are other ways and we have the means. If we co-ordinate what we have and make it work to fulfil its potential then we will not have to whitewash over it with attention grabbing measures which could prove more harmful than beneficial.There is a provision in the Bill for on the spot fines intended to combat late night public order offences. This is a good measure in theory but in four pilot schemes initiated in Britain, it was found that only 53% of fines handed out by the police were paid. Gardaí have commented on this measure and highlighted the difficulties of issuing on the spot fines to drunks outside pubs. It has been suggested that litter wardens would also be needed if this measure is to be made effective. I wonder whether the issuance of these on the spot fines will work in practice. I ask the Minister to re-examine this measure to ensure that it can be enforced.The Bill also addresses gun crime. It will amend the Firearms Acts to require applicants for firearms certificates to satisfy a Garda superintendent that they have provided secure accommodation for their firearms. Concern exists over this measure among gun clubs and game shooting clubs. The shooting of game and clay pigeons is a widespread sport in this country. Game and gun clubs are organised and have responsible members, who are concerned that they are being treated like criminals because this measure is being introduced in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill. I ask the Minister to investigate the concerns of these clubs, which have made submissions to Members and, I am sure, directly to the Minister over the past year. If necessary, he should accommodate their concerns through amendments on Committee and Report Stages.The Bill is good in theory and, hopefully, its measures will work in practice to improve the quality of life of citizens as they go about their day to day business.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I intend to share my time with Deputy Sargent. In the short time that I have been in this House, I have listened regularly to Deputies asking about forthcoming legislation. It is obvious a great deal of background work is required to prepare legislation. We are now being presented with legislation, much of it based on the recommendations of an expert group, containing significant additions by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We are told that the additional sections will be introduced on Committee Stage or later. The extent of what is being proposed is breathtaking. Given that the criminal justice system is the cornerstone of our democracy, this is a shocking way to deal with legislation. It is an outrage.Aspects of this Bill reflect changes in our society, including new technologies such as DNA. More sophisticated crimes involving mobile technologies obviously have to be legislated for. Crime scenes must be preserved for forensic examination, a point strongly made in the report of the Morris Tribunal. Much of what is being proposed will require additional resources. The long promised 2,000 gardaí have not yet materialised but we are adding to their workload. The proposed traffic corps will be drawn from the ranks of the expanded police force. In terms of what is needed, 2,000 is a conservative figure, particularly with regard to community policing and junior liaison officers.We had zero tolerance but discovered it could not be delivered without additional gardaí. It was a high profile stunt intended to produce a quick fix solution at election time. There is no mood for quick fix solutions or stunts.We are now presented with ASBOs as the great solution to vandalism, petty crime and public order offences. What is wrong with naming them correctly? We seem to have a problem with language in this country. Anti-social behaviour is understood differently by different groups.I have a problem with the bypass of due process. We have not seen the nature of the proposals, we have seen them as a bullet points and we heard the Minister say a few words on the subject some months ago but we do not know what they involve.County Kildare is no exception when it comes to the kind of behaviour I described and which falls within the criminal code. I want it tackled through the provision of sufficient police to deter and detect crime. We all know that resources are the main issue in this area. The difficulties faced by gardaí trying to clear the streets at 4 a.m. demonstrate the inadequate numbers available to deal with large numbers of people coming out of discos. The Minister is attempting to present a major solution. It is actually a short-term solution being put in place on the cheap that will have long term consequences if it is implemented.Many Opposition Members took part in the debate on the Children Act, the provisions of which reflect a long-term view. It is comprised of early intervention measures to deal with children at risk or likely to present as having difficulties later in life, rather than punitive measures which have the effect of ruining the lives of the individuals concerned and those close to them. The Children Act contains ten penalties, including community service, day centre orders, parental supervision and curfews, but only two of the measures have been introduced. That Act illustrates that there is a great deal of legislation covering this area but little enforcement of it.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform often talks about taking tough decisions but such decisions necessitate having the political will to fund early intervention measures. I attended a recent event at which John Lonergan spoke and he highlighted that point. He said that a significant number among the prison population were in prison due to failures they encountered in life. Many had literacy and other difficulties which could be diagnosed and addressed by educational intervention at an early stage. Many young people have dropped out of school because they were not able to deal with such difficulties and just as they failed at school, they are now failing in life. Not only are their lives and the lives of their family members ruined but the lack of a Government approach that will address such difficulties costs the State a small fortune. We need to take a long-term view to addressing these aspects in the context of this debate.The introduction of anti-social behaviour orders will add to the difficulties in this area. The use of ASBOs to address the problem is an acceptance of failure in a person's life. The Children's Rights Alliance, which represents 79 non-governmental organisations, describes ASBOs as a serious threat to the rights of all citizens and in particular those of children and young people. They are civil orders which require a lower standard of proof than criminal proceedings and they can be based on hearsay evidence. However, if one breaches an ASBO, one risks being given a jail sentence. That is the nature of ABSOs in a nutshell. They undermine community policing and deviate significantly from the early intervention approach contained in the Children Act and represent a fundamental shift from a problem-solving to a heavy handed punitive solution which is obtained without due process.In Britain, ASBOs, and the more outrageous application of them, are the subject of television programmes. Certain categories of people, including young people, people who are different, such those with an intellectual disability, and the elderly find themselves targeted by ASBOs. Our neighbours across the water have come up with many good ideas but the introduction of ASBOs is not one of them. The jury is out on them at this stage.ASBOs are being presented as a popular measure to give the impression that something is being done. The same impression was given with the passing of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the sanctions contained in the Children Act, but aspects of those Acts were not introduced. Significant administration will be required to implement such orders, but that has not been thought through. Such administration will take from the ability of community police and junior liaison officers to target the people who should be targeted and to give citizens a sense of security by ensuring an adequate Garda presence on the streets.There is a cynicism about the timing of this legislation. If it is passed this year, its provisions will be implemented next year and we will be advised that the problem will be overcome when it is fully implemented just in time for the next general election. This proposal must be rejected. I will table amendments on Committee Stage in this regard.Section 23 seems to imply that the Director of the Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General can seek an order for costs even where somebody has been found to be innocent. The Minister of State might clarify if I have misinterpreted the section. However, if that is the case, I would have serious concerns about it.I also have serious concerns about extending the period of detention from 12 to 24 hours. We must always look at our criminal justice system from the viewpoint of a presumption of innocence until one is found guilty. It is not the majority of people who will be found guilty but the small number of people who will be found innocent that we need to ensure are protected in that respect.I question the value of keeping large banks of DNA, fingerprints, and photographic evidence of people whom it is not intended to prosecute. That will draw from available resources and the retaining of such evidence is an inappropriate intrusion into people's lives. I welcome the Minister of State's comments on that aspect.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	290	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Murphy as a cuid ama a roinnt liom chomh maith. Tááthas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar an mBille um Cheartas Coiriúil 2004. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil neart moltaí ann a tháinig ó ghrúpa saineolais agus is fiú iad a phlé. Tuigim go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh an dlí a thabhairt suas chun dáta ar go leor bealaí. Ag an am céanna, áfach, ní ceist dlíí atá idir lámha anseo. Táimid ag caint ar éifeacht an Gharda Síochána agus an chórais choiriúla, agus sa deireadh thiar thall, beidh na torthaí ar na hathruithe sin níos tábhachtaí ná aon chineál díospóireachta.While this legislation may to a certain extent update measures relating to DNA and mobile phones, in the area of north County Dublin that I represent people will continue to ask where are the gardaí. In 1988 more gardaí were stationed in Balbriggan Garda station than are stationed there today. That area is often referred to as one of the fastest developing suburbs. One can see the houses being built and detect the increased population from increased level of traffic on the roads and the increased level of activity at night, some of it responsible and more of it irresponsible. This means that there is an increased demand for additional gardaí. Although the Government makes considerable play about the provision of an additional 2,000 gardaí, it is out of touch with reality for it to say that those gardaí will be available soon.As to whether there will be any increase in the number of gardaí available when account is taken of natural wastage and the impact of low morale which drives members to leave it is a moot point. Quite a number of the additional gardaí will be assigned to the traffic corps. There is probably a cynical explanation for that, namely, that the traffic corps can derive revenue from road traffic offences. The Minister of State can tell me if I am correct in my assumption. If that is the case, it will result in further lowering of morale among members of the force and a greater problem in our communities which are crying out for additional gardaí.I ask the Minister of State to relay this message in the strongest terms to his senior Minister and the Department. We cannot continue for much longer in this vein. We are sitting on the equivalent of a community timebomb. The complement of gardaí is absolutely frustrated over what they are being expected to do They have additional duties, to do with drug-related offences and the multicultural nature of society as it has developed and any number of special responsibilities. The result is there is enormous reluctance to confront what needs to be done among many gardaí, and not out of any unwillingness. They simply realise that if they pursue relatively minor breaches of the law, incrementally, when these are accumulated the amount of administrative time involved means other work is not done. I know of a number of gardaí whose desks even surpass that of a Deputy in terms of the paperload. I ask the Minister of State to take this on board.Balbriggan, which I represent, is supposed to be in the Drogheda and general Meath-Louth area. It ought to be in the Dublin metropolitan area. It is effectively a part of Dublin. Garda questioning in the case of the raid on the Lusk post office, for example, which involved a number of fatalities, had to be done at Swords. The facilities were just not available. It is a false demarcation line to say that Swords is in the Dublin metropolitan area and Balbriggan is somehow tied to Meath and Louth. Reform is needed to bring the Garda up to date as well as legislation. That requires extra gardaí and improved structures as well.In the Department of Education and Science there is already great reliance on the Garda as regards Oberstown and Trinity House. Gardaí, who all come from Balbriggan, are involved in an enormous amount of travel around the country. That is wholly unfair and deprives the local area of much needed gardaí.The bilingual nature of this legislation is presented on the Bill's cover page. The Garda Síochána, up to now, has had a strong identification with both Irish-speaking and English-speaking citizens. However, I detect a development emanating from the Government to the effect that in the interests of multiculturalism the Irish language requirement will not be as rigorous. The reaction I have had to that has been quite strong. The Minister of State may be surprised to learn that most of this reaction has come from non-nationals, who are very much part of Ireland, as they see it. They are willing and very much expect to learn Irish. I teach adult classes in Irish on a Friday evening, which are attended by a considerable number of non-nationals. I hope the Minister might reflect on this and review the whole situation in context. People coming to this country do not expect to be treated any less "Irish" than Irish people. I hope it is recognised that groups such as I Measc, which is an organisation for non-nationals in Ireland, feel Irish and want to learn the language. They often speak and work through Irish, whether as journalists, translators or members of communities where their children attend Gaelscoileanna. I hope we do not just rush our fences and assume that someone might not want to or is unable to speak Irish. That is not the case.As mentioned earlier, we must be careful in addressing the whole area of petty crime, as it is correctly called, and see matters in context. The euphemism of antisocial behaviour sometimes means we can lose a sense of reality.about this. I work with the Balbriggan Awareness of Drugs Group. The Minister of State may be aware of it from various correspondence sent to him. The emphasis there is on liaising with members of the Garda Síochána and working with parents. The parent to parent courses, voluntarily undertaken and which have considerable support, are producing the types of results the Government needs to support. They involve parents dealing with parenting, and as a result, preventing the types of problem that very often the Government focuses on to the exclusion of the cause. If parent to parent courses could be replicated around the country this would obviate the need for antisocial behavioural orders. Parents could be held to account much more, they would know what to do and be better equipped for the job in hand. Parenting is the most important role that any adult could be asked to undertake.There is much food for thought in this legislation. Beyond that, we must focus on the reality. For many communities it is not about the legislation, but rather where the gardaí are. They want to see more gardaí on the streets.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. While I am in favour of legislation that will boost the fight against crime, there needs to be a balance. While the Minister has introduced a stick, the checks and balances needed are not in place. I will focus on one area in this regard. While the Oireachtas is conferring additional and wide-ranging powers on the Garda, there must also be a balance between rights and responsibilities. One example that gives grounds for concern is the taking of bodily samples, for which there is provision in the legislation. There is also an issue as regards the extension of periods of detention without the requirement to bring a person before a judicial authority. That gives rise for concern, not only from the viewpoints of the individuals in detention but also for the Garda. The more additional powers that are given without the necessary checks and balances being in place, the greater the opportunity for complaints to be made against the Garda by individuals, sometimes unjustifiably. In the interests of the force and the citizen, a balance must be put in place. Sadly, that detail is not provided in this legislation.I want to focus on the issue of bodily samples, fingerprints and photographs. The Irish Human Rights Commission has made a detailed submission on this. The commission has requested that a set of formal guidelines be put in place as regards such samples. It has made a number of significant recommendations as regards, for example, affording reasonable privacy to individuals in custody, noting that a person of the same sex should be present and that the taking of bodily samples should not involve any cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. I will return to this topic in a couple of minutes. This should be the norm not alone for the suspect, but also for the Garda Síochána and the health professionals involved. I hope samples will be taken by nurses, medical practitioners or dentists, depending on the procedure involved, rather than gardaí. In the case of children or incapacitated persons an independent witness should be present. These basic protections should be introduced.Another recommendation made by the Human Rights Commission was to record on video the taking of bodily samples in all circumstances except when a suspect does not wish to have the procedure recorded. It is imperative that this recommendation be introduced to protect the rights of both the suspect and members of the Garda Síochána. Suspects should also have a right to receive legal advice on the provision of a bodily sample.The Bill amends the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990. It proposes, for example, to increase the defined period for the holding of a sample from six to 12 months and allow for mouth swabs and saliva samples to be taken without consent. These proposals deserve careful scrutiny because the need to impose such requirements will progressively decline in the coming years owing to continuing technological advances in the area of genetic DNA amplication. Cheek swabs, for instance, will no longer be necessary. As such, the new provision must be subject to ongoing review. Other legislation includes provision for an annual or biennial review of its provisions. This legislation should also provide for such review, given that oral samples will no longer be necessary in a few years because hair samples will be sufficient to carry out DNA analysis.The Minister has indicated he may introduce regulations to provide for the manner in which samples are taken, their location, physical conditions etc. It is imperative that he change the word "may" to "shall" because specific, detailed regulations on how samples are to be taken are essential. However, no such regulations should be introduced before the House takes a positive decision on the matter. I hope the Minister will accede to my request as it would provide the checks and balances the legislation requires.The Bill also provides for the Garda Síochána to use so-called "reasonable force" but does not define the term. This principle should be clarified for the sake of suspects and gardaí who need to know the precise circumstances under which force can be used and what type of force can be used. The level of force used should be commensurate with the scale of the offence about which a suspect is being questioned.As I stated, we need to protect suspects, gardaí and any other persons present when a DNA sample is taken. The Law Reform Commission has pointed out the practical difficulties associated with using reasonable force to obtain a mouth swab. It notes, for example, that while this power exists in the UK, it is considered dangerous not only for the person seeking to obtain the sample because he or she may be bitten by the suspect but also for the individual from whom the sample is being obtained as the procedure may cause injury. I hope appropriate and significant amendments will be made to the relevant section of the Bill before it is enacted.With regard to section 30 on firearms storage, approximately 200,000 ordinary, decent people hold gun licences. The inclusion in a criminal justice Bill of provisions covering legally held firearms creates an impression that the holders of such arms are considered criminals. It is wrong to introduce provisions on gun licensing for sporting purposes in criminal justice legislation. Garda statistics show that the illegal use of firearms by licensed gun holders is not a significant problem. The Minister must revisit this section for a number of reasons. He received an extensive submission from the National Association of Regional Game Councils, the representative body of those involved in the legitimate sport of shooting. Its members should not be criminalised by including them in this legislation.Sensible firearms policies are necessary but this requires modernisation of the 1925 Act. Regulations should be introduced on the storage of guns by tourists. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, in his contribution on Second Stage earlier in the year, referred to tourists locking guns into the boots of cars, a dangerous practice which is ignored in the Bill. Firearms legislation must address specific firearms issues which should not be dealt with in general criminal justice legislation. The majority of licensed gun holders are decent, law-abiding citizens and the inclusion of section 30 unfairly labels them.All public representatives are occasionally approached by individuals who have been refused a gun licence without grounds being given by the Garda. As my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, noted, the Garda Síochána sometimes receives soft intelligence on specific individuals and this forms the basis of its refusal to issue a gun licence. However, such intelligence does not feature in the majority of refusals. Those refused licences or renewals should be given reasons for the decision and a right of appeal should be enshrined in the legislation to allow a second opinion to be obtained. The area of firearms licences is in need of reform but this should be done in specific firearms legislation rather criminal justice legislation.Every speaker so far has raised the issue of anti-social behaviour. The Minister has discussed the matter outside the House and promised to introduce legislation to deal with it, including anti-social behaviour orders which every Fianna Fáil backbench Deputy who speaks today will say is the solution. He devoted just one sentence to the issue in his contribution. We do not know the detail of the provisions about which the Minister is talking and it is about time he started outlining them. He can define it whatever way he likes and call it what he likes, but it is a significant problem in many communities. People are sick and tired of new legislation with little action and enforcement subsequently. Without giving the resources to the Garda it is pointless enacting more legislation. We still have not seen the 2,000 extra Garda — another hollow commitment by the Government before the last general election. The reality, with which we deal on a daily basis, is that communities cannot get gardaí. There is need for a complete overhaul, both of the recruitment and retention of gardaí within the force to address the issue and of garda rostering.For example on a Saturday night in the town of Athlone which has a massive catchment area throughout the midlands, five gardaí are on duty. Of those five gardaí, two could be called out to a road traffic accident leaving three gardaí in the town of Athlone and its catchment area. There could be a disturbance abroad in Glasson and two gardaí would have to go out to that. The town of Athlone would then be policed by one member of the Garda Síochána. If there is a report of a domestic violence incident, two returning gardaí must go to that. How can they police our streets when the Minister is not giving basic resources to the Garda to police them at the times they are needed, at weekends and at night when there are difficulties? The rostering system does not facilitate that. Over the past eight years in which this and the previous Government have been in office, they have closed down the rural Garda stations. One Garda station close to my home is open for one hour a month. That is supposed to be a rural Garda station. That is not rural policing. The individuals in that community do not know their local garda.We need to look at many of the issues. They do not require legislation. They require resources. They require political commitment and sadly that is not there. There is the farcical position on PULSE. Only one in four Garda stations operates PULSE. Gardaí are travelling 20 or 30 miles to input data into PULSE and returning to their base. That is not a proper use of Garda resources.The Minister still has gardaí in clerical posts throughout the country when they should be out on the streets enforcing the laws we pass in this House. Garda time is being consistently wasted and the Minister is doing nothing about it. All he is talking about is bringing in ever more legislation without giving the Garda the resources, manpower and structures to facilitate it.The communications system used by the Garda Síochána is also farcical. Gardaí who want to use a secure method of communication must use their personal mobile telephones.Planning is another issue causing considerable problems and it will continue to cause problems. It is consistently ignored in addressing the issue of anti-social behaviour on which it has a significant impact. I am lucky enough to have come across the problems with planning, seen the plans at first hand and spoken with planners about planning. There are green areas not overlooked by houses and alleyways without public lighting not visible from any home. Such areas facilitate anti-social behaviour. That type of planning should not be accepted in this day and age. We should have learned from the planning mistakes over the past 20 or 30 years. Local authorities are trying to resolve those problems in housing estates while consistently planners are approving housing developments which facilitate and promote anti-social behaviour. There is a role for the local Garda superintendent in looking at the plans and advising the local authority on addressing such issues by stating, for example, that if a green area will cause more trouble rather than facilitate the community, it would be better incorporated into the adjoining property of a householder rather than leaving it as a green area merely to meet the conditions laid down in the planning laws that a certain percentage of land must be left open as a green area.Although there are many aspects of anti-social behaviour that I wanted to raise, one particular issue is the probation and welfare service. It is a significantly under resourced asset which needs to be strengthened so that it can become a significant asset in addressing anti-social behaviour and many other petty crime issues. Sadly we regularly see young people over the age of 18 going into the prison system. We see juveniles from many parts of the country going into Trinity House and other facilities in Dublin. Such places are a breeding ground not only for anti-social behaviour but for criminal activity. If the Minister properly resourced the probation and welfare service he would keep many young people out of the prison system in the first instance. Many young people would learn a great deal more from taking up a yard brush and daily sweeping an estate where they have caused specific problems with anti-social behaviour, both from the point of view of humiliation and hard labour. That could resolve many of the problems of re-offending in anti-social behaviour. It would be preferable to putting people into the criminal justice system where one will not solve any problem but will cause problems for the future.There have been a number of campaigns on drink-driving, speeding and insurance fraud. We need a public awareness campaign on anti-social behaviour. I have spoken to young people, some of whom have been involved in anti-social behaviour. Many are not aware of the impact their anti-social behaviour is having on older people and the wider community. We need to look at that element. We have many avenues of communications available to us. We should use them.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I concur with the comments of my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, when he expressed his dismay at the unfortunate habit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of bringing legislation before the House before he has finished writing it. In the middle of its passing, he then proceeds to introduce substantial amendments which either add significantly to the scope of the Bill, as in this case, or change what it originally set out to do. The raft of legislation introduced encompasses so much. No doubt updated criminal justice legislation is needed but it should be considered and thought through, not like the patchwork of proposals the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has put before the Oireachtas.At the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, the Minister stated that he did not believe he would pass two criminal justice Bills. Instead, he has combined one and a half bits of policy in one Bill, with the result that it does do the job properly. This Bill covers everything, from firearms, to explosives, to electronic tagging, to increased powers for the Garda Síochána.Fine Gael has already made its position clear. There should be a separate Bill to deal with the serious issues of firearms. Deputy Naughten made a valid point on the significant number of licensed firearms held by property owners throughout the country; he referred to firearms held illegally and used to commit the increasingly common crimes that we associate with the term of this Government, and to explosives which cannot be treated satisfactorily in an appended section to a Bill designed to deal with almost everything else. The Minister's ego should no more interfere with the proper enactment of legislation than should his fear of being imminently put out of office.In so far as there is a need for legislation like this, elements of this Bill are to be welcomed. At a time when crime — irrespective of how the Minister, Deputy McDowell, chooses to assess it — is at unprecedentedly high levels, it is vital that we, as legislators, take steps to tackle the issues that affect so many citizens in an intimate and intrusive way on an all too frequent basis.With regard to crime levels and the number of gardaí on the streets, the Minister missed an opportunity to improve the situation by allowing gardaí retire at the age of 50 after 30 years service. Many gardaí would stay in the service if they got any sort of a deal. As a result of this retirement provision, we have lost an experienced section of the Garda Síochána. They could have been rostered on day shifts but they got no incentive to remain in the force. There has been a huge exodus of talented gardaí who could have been kept.There is much in this Bill to cause concern, such as the changes the Minister proposes to make to the process by which arrest warrants are issued. On one hand the Minister has failed to deal with current issues of confidence in gardaí and on the other, he wants them to issue arrest warrants in urgent circumstances. This is a superfluous provision as gardaí have never had difficulty in obtaining a search warrant because of the lack of someone to issue it. Members of the Judiciary have been known to issue such warrants from their living rooms at midnight if circumstances require it or it is urgent.This Bill proposes to provide value for money by the creation of a new controlling officer and it is proposed that the Garda Commissioner will be the new Accounting Officer. This is necessary, particularly when we consider the debacle this week regarding computer technology. It is quite extraordinary that only one in four Garda stations can use the PULSE system considering Ireland has some of the best technology world wide. It is not rocket science. Let us consider the example of the national lottery system and its interactive games that are found in every town and village in the country. It is extraordinary that technology that pays out cash prizes instantly has been in place since 1987 but, after all the money spent on PULSE, only one in four Garda stations are connected to it.With regard to the current debacle in the computer system used by the health services, the system is a German software system that is one of the best in the world. The difficulty was with the implementation rather than the software and with the management and integration of the system in health boards throughout the country.I am quite certain the software for the PULSE system is also top class. People may get the impression the Government is blaming the software, but that is not the problem. It is extraordinary, however, that there is a problem with the integration of software. Therefore, with responsibility lying with the Garda Commissioner as Accounting Officer, rather than with a Secretary General, there will be more accountability for the significant Garda budget.This week we saw the appalling state of a Garda station on television. When we consider the lack of investment and disparity of conditions in which gardaí work, the number of Garda stations that have been closed and the lack of gardaí on the streets, it does not surprise me that crime and anti-social behaviour are at the level they are. Unfortunately, when it comes to policing estates effectively, the Garda does not have sufficient manpower. The level of management and control are understandable given that the number of gardaí rostered on duty at any given time is low.The technology used by gardaí contributes to crime levels. Despite the excellent technology in the country, gardaí still use mobile phones. The criminal element in the country are quite capable of knowing enough to keep ahead of gardaí and to intercept and eavesdrop on what is being discussed. It is not good enough, considering the amount of taxpayers' money spent, that we have not got a better system in operation.The Minister mentioned bringing volunteers, as in the manner of the FCA, into the Garda Síochána. I am not sure if his plans include bringing back people who had retired or people would just volunteer to join the Garda. I cannot see how this will work in regard to their effectiveness and powers or if they will be trained to the same standard as current members.Some Garda stations are in an appalling condition. I welcome the new development planned for Ballymote. Gardaí have operated in appalling conditions there for the past 30 years. Although it is a district station, it did not even have a detention area for prisoners or interview facilities. Not before time, this much needed project is going to tender.I cannot see the need to extend the power to issue arrest warrants to Garda superintendents. I am not aware of any call for such a measure from gardaí nor am I aware of any complaints about the current system having been made by the Judiciary. It is also unclear from the Bill under what urgent circumstances the provision would be necessary or why there is a problem with the current system which operates in a transparent and accountable fashion.Furthermore, I am concerned that section 5, which allows Garda superintendents to issue search warrants, may be open to constitutional challenge as it appears to infringe on the inviolability of the home as enshrined in Article 40.5 of Bunreacht na hÉireann. This inviolability is seriously diminished by this provision. Notwithstanding the separation of powers, this is a major change for the Judiciary and will cause significant concern among people involved in the Courts Service.It may be outside the remit of this Bill, but it is not good enough that some people who attend the Four Courts, who may have engaged top legal teams, may have their case deferred or that they be left waiting months for a judgment to be made because the judge on the day has decided to take the afternoon off.I am also very concerned that the Minister has not exercised care in terms of his proposals for arrest without warrant. We must be extremely careful about proposals to restrict the liberty of individuals. Only in specific and limited circumstances should gardaí be free to arrest people without a warrant. This is a provision that requires close examination and a careful balance. On one hand there is a need to give gardaí the powers they need to enforce the law and bring criminals to justice, and on the other, the rights of the individual and the presumption of innocence.Other concerns are the treatment of people in courts, bail conditions and, as we heard from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the inability to collect fines. In Dublin alone, millions of euro are owed in uncollected fines. Some people make a part payment and the remainder is invariably left unpaid. This again is the result of an inadequate technology facility. It is extraordinary that the nation that is second in the world for software production seems to have an inability to incorporate the latest technology in these areas. We pride ourselves on having the best educated workforce in the world but when it comes to the provision of State services and the ability to dealing with matters in a businesslike manner, we fail dismally. This is disappointing considering the perception of Ireland abroad as a prosperous and successful business country.If one examines the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General dealing with court services, or the Garda report that has been mentioned, one will note that there is a great deal of criticism. The Comptroller and Auditor General has criticised the massive deficiencies in two key areas. I welcome the decision to give the Garda Commissioner total responsibility in this regard. I note the accountability provisions relating to how taxpayers' money is spent.The Irish Human Rights Commission has expressed concerns about the proposal in the Bill to amend the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 to allow the Garda Síochána to take a swab from any part of a person's body. Deputy Naughten has spoken about this matter. The commission has raised the constitutional issue of the right to bodily integrity. I am aware that the courts have yet to explore the issue fully. I have raised it at this stage as something that needs to be examined closely. I do not doubt that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will make a comment on the matter. We should not enact a provision that is unconstitutional or interferes unduly with the right of an individual to bodily integrity.The Minister has provided in this Bill for a change in the limitation period within which certain prosecutions may be brought. There are concerns that he has shown some inconsistency in this regard. I ask him to provide a more complete explanation of the rationale behind the proposal in section 24, which needs to be explored.This is an important Bill in light of the inquiries which have taken place throughout the country, particularly the inquiry into the fallout from the various difficulties in County Donegal. The proposals to give increased powers to the gardaí and to devolve autonomous power to the regions need to be considered in that context. I suppose there has been a slight redefinition of certain aspects of how the gardaí will operate in the future. It is important that the proposals are made totally clear. There should be no ambiguity about what needs to be done. We need to ensure there is value for money, efficiency and accountability. I am concerned about the number of Garda stations and the level of gardaí on the streets.I would like to discuss the level of undetected crime that affects businesses. It is clear to those who watch television programmes like "CrimeCall" that most businesses are investing heavily in security systems such as CCTV cameras and night safes. Such facilities are par for the course as a consequence of the level of violent crime in pharmacies, supermarkets, licensed premises and hotels. Those who are assessing the level of risk in the services sector are trying to get inside the criminal mind. I am concerned that the State does not recognise sufficiently the level of private sector investment in facilities to help to control crime. Such recognition could take the form of tax incentives or benefits which assist those who are investing in equipment to maximise the safety of private enterprise. The Government has failed to take action to increase the current low level of such investment.Many companies are employing private security guards to help them out. There has been an increase in the number of private security guards. We have not heard much about the private security firms Bill in recent times. We need to decide how such firms should interact with the Garda. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has spoken about the recruitment of voluntary gardaí to work in an honorary capacity, with expenses being paid to them. It is important that we reflect on the manner in which private security firms are established. I am aware that such firms are the subject of another Bill, but the matter should be considered in the context of the legislation currently before the House. We need to ensure there is independent regulation of private security firms.I am concerned about the Government's U-turn in section 31. I refer to the minimum age of criminal responsibility. The Children Act 2001, which was quite progressive, provided for a minimum age of criminal responsibility of 12 years. The Minister has failed to bring the relevant section of the 2001 Act into force and he is now trying to amend it by reducing the relevant age to ten years. This matter merits more discussion. Perhaps the Minister could use his time better by bringing existing legislation into force, rather than unilaterally trying to rewrite it.There was an extraordinary level of attendance at the public meetings which were organised by Fine Gael at venues throughout the country to debate the big issue of anti-social behaviour. Many people expressed a sense of dismay at the increase in such behaviour. It seems that any member of the Garda who applies to the courts for an anti-social behaviour order to be imposed will have to be of the rank of superintendent, at least. Strict Garda guidelines on the appropriate use of anti-social behaviour orders will need to be drawn up by the Garda Commissioner, approved by the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the new powers can be deployed.Anti-social behaviour will continue to be one of the big issues among people who have invested heavily in communities. I suggest to the Minister that far more community gardaí be employed. The Minister has discussed the possibility of district superintendents working actively with local authorities, but that is not happening. The voluntary sector has done huge work. Garda sergeants, inspectors and superintendents should be actively involved in communities. We are all familiar with the outdated police watch and Garda watch schemes. The Garda authorities need to get involved with members and officials from local authorities, as well as representatives of local communities. I refer, for example, to people who give up their free time to work with sporting and community organisations on a voluntary basis. That such co-operation is not taking place is evident when one considers the level of unrest in many areas.I would like to cite the example of a major nursing institution in Sligo. The management of the nursing home in question is seriously considering the closure of the facility as a consequence of anti-social behaviour in its vicinity. Although such behaviour is being reported to the Garda on a constant basis, nothing has happened. The facility, which can accommodate 50 patients, has just 27 patients because the Garda is not getting involved. Although there is huge demand for nursing home places in the region, just 27 of the 50 places in the nursing home are occupied. Serious consideration is being given to the closure of the institution, which is a major provider of nursing home facilities in the Sligo region, because of a lack of co-ordination on the part of the Garda. People are being intimidated when they visit the nursing home, which is located in an area that suffers from many anti-social behaviour problems. Cars have been damaged and unbelievable acts of injustice have been perpetrated against the people who own the nursing home, which is one of the region's major assets. It is not good enough.There is a major problem of anti-social behaviour in this country. We need more gardaí, more community involvement in policing and complete integration on the part of the gardaí who are dealing with crime on the ground. Those who perpetrate criminal acts need to be dealt with by the courts and fined accordingly.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	293	My Sinn Féin colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, has outlined our party's concerns about the provisions of this Bill as published. He spoke specifically about the proposals to extend significantly the powers of the Garda, including the proposal to extend the period of detention to up to 24 hours. Further proposed new powers include the power of compulsion of bodily samples without consent and powers to issue search warrants. The Deputy also spoke about the Irish Human Rights Commission's advice that the Minister's proposals may violate constitutional rights, as well as EU and international law. He confirmed that while Sinn Féin supports measures which are tough on crime, it cannot support the Bill before the House, as outlined.Many communities are wondering whether the Garda needs to be given more powers. They believe that more effective and strategic deployment of Garda resources is needed. Garda reform is necessary to ensure gardaí are made accountable to the communities they serve. In other words, the Garda's present powers need to be put to better use and more resources need to be devoted to crime. Legislation seems to be introduced every year with the aim of resolving the crime problems which are found in certain communities. We were told that previous Bills would stop young people from drinking in fields, hanging around or becoming involved in anti-social behaviour. The reality for many communities, certainly the communities I represent, is that this problem continues. People still live in fear in their own communities.On Monday next, a childhood development initiative will be launched in the Jobstown area of Tallaght. A previous report was based on interviews with young children from many of the estates in the area. The children were asked what issues needed to be addressed by society, Government and local politicians. One of the major issues for the young children was security. They talked in terms of bullying at school and so on, but also about security in their homes and their fears of living on their estates. Not a weekend goes by when I do not get a telephone call from a person living in terror in his or her home, and other public representatives in the area get similar calls. People are crying out for help. They say they have tried to contact gardaí or others but no-one responds while gangs are attacking their homes and property. They are living in fear. I do not know how many families have visited my advice clinics to look for help and told me they want to move out of the area because they are terrified. These are people who, in many cases, have lived 20 and 30 years in their community but they say they have never known it as bad as it is now. The Bill before us will not resolve the situation for those families.We need more resources devoted to crime prevention and targeted at disadvantaged areas, as recommended by the National Crime Council and demanded by Sinn Féin. Why would we dispute that disadvantaged areas should be targeted and given that support? These areas are in the front line for attacks. As a society, we should pull together with decent people living in the communities faced with these attacks, which take place particularly at weekends but also during the week.Last month the Minister casually presented proposals for additions to the Criminal Justice Bill which would change the Bill beyond recognition. On behalf of my party I object to the Minister's modus operandi of publishing and debating one Bill on Second Stage before introducing a raft of controversial amendments on Committee Stage that never see proper debate in this House. What comes back from committee is effectively a totally different Bill. The effect is to suppress debate on controversial issues of public interest. This is the typical demagoguery we have come to expect from this Minister. It is not acceptable democratic practice and the Taoiseach should rein in the Minister.I want to address a number of the proposed amendments. I will begin with the Minister's proposal to bring the notorious anti-social behaviour orders to this jurisdiction. Sinn Féin has challenged anti-social behaviour in our communities for many years. We recognise it as a significant problem. Our communities deserve solutions that work, not the pre-election gimmicks offered by the Minister, Deputy McDowell. The Minister is determined to convince us that his ASBOs are radically different to those used in Britain but this is simply not the case. While the duration of the order and the maximum prison sentence for its breach are less than in Britain, it should be remembered that the consequences of a criminal conviction for the individual are lifelong. Like the British ASBOs, because it will be a civil order, the onus of proof and hence assumption of innocence unless proven guilty is not safeguarded in the same manner as in a criminal trial. When imprisonment results from breach of an ASBO for non-criminal behaviour, the effect is the denial of the right to a fair trial. In this regard the Minister's proposals and British ASBOs are the same.ASBOs are wrong. Their use involves a denial of human rights under international law and the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, anti-social behaviour orders do not work. After more than six years of implementation in Britain, there is no evidence ASBOs have reduced much less eliminated anti-social behaviour. According to Home Office figures published in March the breach rate is over 40%. Even the Garda Representative Association opposes their implementation here.I am not speaking off the top of my head. I have travelled to Britain to talk to many of the communities affected by anti-social behaviour. We are all seeking genuine solutions to this growing phenomenon, not only in Ireland but abroad also. Most of the behaviour we call "anti-social" is actually criminal behaviour. Criminal behaviour should result in criminal charges and prosecution. We need to enforce the existing law. In England, I have seen photographs of children posted in local centres and medical centres with messages such as "If you have seen this person, contact... ". Given my long experience with the problems of young people involved in anti-social and criminal behaviour, I am uncomfortable with the idea of "wanted" notices in community centres and medical centres.The legislation is already in place to deal with anti-social behaviour. For example, the Public Order Act 1994 allows the Garda to arrest and charge people for intoxication in a public place, disorderly conduct in a public place, threatening, abusive or intimidating behaviour in a public place, or failure to comply with a Garda direction. We were told the Act would resolve the situation with regard to young people gathering on green spaces and so on. We were given all sorts of commitments by all sorts of Ministers and other politicians, who said this would resolve the problems faced by communities. I remember the debate on the original Bill. At the time, I did not believe it would solve the problem because whether legislation was put in place, I was not sure the will existed to act on the legislation.The problem is widespread, not just in urban but in rural areas, and the same message comes from people living in rural areas. However, we do not have the resources to tackle the problem. When politicians are contacted by constituents and telephone a Garda station, they are told the resources are not available. I have shared platforms with colleagues from my party and other parties in trying to address this issue. In my constituency there is general agreement between Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the PDs, the Labour Party and all the parties active in that area. The common view is that there are not enough Garda resources in the constituency. If gardaí are asked whether they can get a car to an area where a woman or a family is living in terror, or where there are gangs outside a house, off the record the gardaí will say they do not have the resources or that they have sent a car but the crowd is too large for the gardaí to deal with. I have witnessed situations when two gardaí have gone to an incident but have been assaulted by gangs outside residents' houses. The will exists on the part of many gardaí but the resources are not in place, unfortunately.Sinn Féin has called meetings of local estate management groups and tried to involve the local community — the people affected — and the local gardaí. I remember one meeting in my constituency attended by an inspector, a sergeant, a number of community gardaí, the usual politicians and members of the community at which a breeze block was thrown through the window of the car owned by a Labour Party councillor and it was robbed. On the night of another meeting, a car was set on fire because the local gurriers in the area knew we were trying to resolve the problems the community faced.In that same community where those attacks occurred, I dealt with a woman who was myopic and who lived on her own. Her son who was going to college was forced out of the house. He was attacked going into the house because he was seen as odd that he was going to college. That woman's house was attacked for three days. Tiles were missing from her roof following those attacks. She was terrified in her home. That is just one example.Down the road another woman's children were constantly attacked. She felt it would be safer for the children to live in Israel rather than in that estate, and this was at the time of the suicide bombings there. It shames me as a local representative from that area and as an Irish citizen that someone should have to go through that. I could bring anyone to the area to talk to people who will go through their stories. I do not believe my area is very different from anyone else's although perhaps I can articulate more extreme cases. Every Member of this House has a story to tell about the failure of our society to support people who are vulnerable in their communities.As has been highlighted by the Coalition Against ASBOs, these orders violate the principle of diversion of children from the criminal justice system and are contrary to the Children Act and the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Children Act contains many provisions which involve alternatives to deal with anti-social and other criminal behaviour by young people. However, the Minister has refused to activate parts of the Act or to give it enough resources to work.The last thing one wants is young people getting into the criminal justice system by going to jail or whatever. There are alternatives, including a number of pilot schemes to try to keep young people out of the criminal justice system. In my area, the probation and welfare service runs such schemes. When one of the groups applied to the Minister to expand a programme which was working, keeping young people out of the criminal justice system and turning them around, it was told money was not available for this type of pilot scheme even though it had been in place for eight or nine years in that area. The general consensus among certain politicians, gardaí and the probation and welfare service was that it was working but resources were not available.ASBOs will do nothing to address the root causes of anti-social behaviour such as drug and alcohol misuse, mental health problems, lack of proper parenting or family or other support and lack of community recreational and youth facilities. Sinn Féin proposes other options which will be more effective if given the chance and the proper resources. These include better community policing to deter and enforce existing law, which makes sense; more resources to enhance community supervision by the probation and welfare service — I gave an example in my community; full implementation of the provisions of the Children Act 2001, including youth diversion programmes, conferencing options, community sanctions and parental sanctions; and community restorative justice alternatives to imprisonment or fines for adults engaged in anti-social behaviour. A group in my area is active in respect of restorative justice. It has worked to a large extent in the North. It places the onus on those involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour to change their behaviour. It is an example of the community coming together and it is an area which has received little attention in the fight against crime in the community and in the support of gardaí.Other proposals include a community mediation service for conflict resolution, such as that which operates in Norway, where the behaviour involved is disruptive and offence but not criminal; and more resources for mental health care, addiction treatment, social services and investment in community infrastructure in disadvantaged areas, including recreational and youth facilities.The infrastructure is in place in many areas but the policy was to close many of those centres because many schemes in which people were involved were being disbanded. I welcome the fact there seems to be a change in that regard. Hopefully, those community facilities will continue to engage and involve more young people. Getting young people off the streets can help to avoid many of the problems in which young people get involved. I have examples from my area where community facilities for young people are open until 12 midnight or 12.30 a.m. There is also a drop-in centre for young people. We must get young people off the streets and street corners and get them involved in positive activity and interaction with adults and their peers. Education also has a part to play, for example, providing young people with computer facilities.The next important issue is the Minister's proposal to lower the age of criminal responsibility by two years to ten years of age. Employing twisted logic, the Minister argues he is raising the age of criminal responsibility by three years but that is not the case. The Children Act makes provision for the age of criminal responsibility to be 12 years and this commitment must be implemented and not discarded.As regards the Minister's other proposals, including a drug offenders' register, mandatory minimum sentences and electronic monitoring, I do not believe he has demonstrated the need for certain measures or that they are based on a sound examination of costs and social outcomes of similar measures in other jurisdictions. A number of his other proposals also pose a threat to fundamental civil liberties.I reiterate my party's frustration at the Minister's anti-democratic habit of transforming Bills on a whim midway through the legislative process.

Clearly, many parties have the same views on issues. What is happening in all our communities, particularly in disadvantaged ones, is indicative of what is happening in our society. On the one hand, there is the Celtic tiger but on the other, there is the Ireland of poverty, unemployment, drugs and of communities, predominantly working class ones, which have no infrastructure, are concrete jungles with no playgrounds and which are without care. There are communities which rarely see a garda except on official duty or in a garda car. We are losing touch with a significant section of our community by not putting the resources into it. Those resources would come from the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and, in particular, Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The message we must send to the people is that the Parliament cares and will act and do more to support communities in need.A reality of modern life is that young people are growing up in communities who often never meet one of their parents. The other parent in the home is working or is always out or perhaps there are other issues involved. Young people are growing up who have no sense of responsibility or of belonging because they do not see anybody who is a model of what one might call the traditional type of caring parent or who demonstrates caring behaviour. That is why there are gangs on the street and people who lose control on a Friday night as a result of drink and become extremely aggressive. We need to address that. This Bill addresses some of the issues which arise but not others.Many living in these communities fall into the drug culture. I recently spoke to an individual, formerly a heroin user, who was in drug rehabilitation through a useful and important community group. When I asked him why he did heroin, he replied it was the only good experience he and his fellow users ever had in their lives. It physically did something for them as there was nothing else for them in their communities. From recent reports on heroin seizures, the Garda is effective in going after the drug barons and dealers. However, more quantities are being seized, an indication of greater consumption of this and other drugs. We are not doing enough to deal with this issue.I acknowledge the fine work done by the Dublin Drug Court. Has the Government extended it to other areas in the Dublin metropolitan area? While the Dublin Drug Court took up much time and investment, I was privileged to sit in on the debates on issues with social workers, the Garda and the judge to see the intensity, commitment and powerful drive the court has in dealing with these issues. It is a fine day when a former drug user sits besides the judge to receive the acknowledgement that he or she is now drug-free and a different person. When one meets these people and their families, they are extremely happy to have beaten drug addiction and something new is happening in their lives. They are also happy there was an intensive investment from the Government and State agencies into managing their lives.Hopefully, they can manage to stay drug free. However, for an individual with a conviction for heroin abuse who has been through the courts, there is a stage in his or her life where he or she may wish to change. What can this individual do with a record of conviction when looking for a job? Many employers will not take on people with convictions. If a person is drug free for a minimum of seven years, backed up with evidence from the Garda and social services, he or she should be allowed to apply through the courts for the conviction to be wiped, allowing for a fresh start. Recently a person attended my clinic who had served a five year term in jail for a serious drug offence but who was now trying to get his life together. While the post release social support services in Mountjoy Prison were helpful to him, he still could not get a job. He told me he would be forced to commit another offence simply to earn a living. While I am not being soft on crime or drugs, more support services are needed for those who leave the prison system, no matter how serious the conviction, who have paid their dues to society and want to take up their lives again. They can come under severe pressure from their former associates to return to crime. The individual I referred to was in an appalling state. More ought to be done for him seeing as he had paid his dues and wanted to lead a proper life.This morning a lady in an appalling state attended my clinic and showed me photographs of what was formerly her home. Windows were broken, doors smashed in and the place was a total mess. When I contacted the social worker, she informed me she could not deal with it because the housing officer had not asked her to. There needs to be more effort in tackling issues where there are social problems, tenants living in appalling conditions and families with serious issues. We are not simply doing enough in this area. While this lady has an appointment to meet the social worker next Monday, I do not know what will happen in the interim.To tackle crime, we have on the one hand the courts, the Garda and the justice machinery to work out these problems. On the other hand, we must do much more to support those communities in need, particularly those where historically individuals drop out of school without qualifications and fall into drug use.When the Criminal Assets Bureau seizes the property of drug barons, it must be retained for seven years before it goes into the State coffers. Fine Gael and Labour recently put down a motion, rejected by the Government, which sought to have the moneys seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau returned directly to those communities affected by crime rather than used for filling potholes and paying for a computer mess-up in the Department of Health and Children. The proceeds of drugs and crime seized from those individuals who live off the backs of others in their communities must be spent directly in those communities. This money must pay for community halls and other resources that these communities do not have. The return of the proceeds of crime must be related directly to the communities from which they are taken.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	297	If one looks at the prison population in Mountjoy Prison, the majority, some two thirds, come from five identifiable areas in Dublin. When discussing disadvantaged areas in Dublin, we cannot say we do not know where they are. When I was Minister of State with responsibility for local development, we designated those areas in Dublin that are disadvantaged, putting partnership boards into them. The drugs ministerial taskforce, of which I was a member, applied the local taskforces on the same basis. We know from income, participation in second and third level education and social welfare benefit statistics, where in Dublin the difficult areas are and where particular attention must be paid.The one set of people who do not know much about these areas are judges. I am not having a go at judges per se but few of them have grown up in these areas or even had occasion to visit them. Most Members by being involved in these communities are aware of what is happening in them, while judges do not have much of an idea. Sometimes, they make decisions on mistaken beliefs. A programme must be encouraged by the courts’ officers to encourage judges, particularly those in the lower courts, to spend some time in these disadvantaged areas. They would learn, for example, that one or two families can turn a beautiful estate of 70 houses into a hell for the other residents. Sometimes, judges look for unrealistic evidence to come down on those making life hell for other residents.Some engagement must take place with judges where, as part of their duties, they spend some time in these areas finding out what it is like on the ground. Judges have an input that will be helpful. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform knows about the BASE youth development in Ballyfermot from having been involved in its launch. All members of the Government and anyone who wishes to tackle the crime problem should visit that project. While it has not yet opened, its development team is in place. Usually, when youth clubs are built, items such as snooker tables or table tennis facilities are installed and are welcome. However, in this case the people involved in the club in conjunction with the public authorities did some research. For example, the club will have facilities for cutting CDs to facilitate music writing as well as other creative ideas that will attract children and young people to it. Children and young people now want more than was available to us when we were young. They have too many distractions. If they can be attracted to facilities like the BASE facility, we might be able to divert their energies in a positive way. The House should consider how many BASE-type projects can be got up and running in all 11 partnership board areas in Dublin. Thereafter, we should examine the possibility of introducing them in other locations. This is the way to divert many of the energies to which I referred earlier.In Question No. 430 of 4 October 2005, I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if he would make a statement on the level of recidivism in prisons in Ireland. He replied:It is regrettable that accurate figures relating to the rates of recidivism in the prisoner population are not available at the present time. Since taking office however, I have sought to address this deficit through a major research project which is currently being undertaken by the institute of criminology in University College Dublin in co-operation with my Department.I do not know when the study was undertaken. It might have been after I tabled the question. The Minister continued:It is hoped that the findings will present an accurate picture of recidivism which, in turn, will assist and shape the way we manage prison sentences in the future. I understand that the findings of this research are expected in early 2007.How can we address any issue regarding criminal activity if we do not know something as basic as the rate of recidivism? This is not the first time I have spoken in the House about statistics. I introduced a Private Member's Bill on crime statistics. Last year, I spoke in a debate on crime without making any party political points. I spent my time discussing how the former Mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, turned things around in that city. In particular, I outlined the system used in New York to measure crimes so they could measure their level of success in dealing with crime. The Minister has been in office for three years. If we do not know something as basic as the recidivism rate in prisons by now, how can we restore law and order? It is farcical that such basic information is not available to the Minister.All law and no order is farcical. A special committee within the Law Reform Commission should be established to conduct annual audits of criminal justice laws, in order to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens. This is desirable because 60 criminal justice Acts have passed through the Dáil between 19 February 1985 and 8 March 2005. What is the House debating? Another item of legislation, namely, the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The mind boggles that we believe issues can be dealt with simply through legislation. During that 20-year period, 17 of those laws related to issues such as the Decommissioning Act, extradition and the Children Act. However, the remaining 43 were specifically aimed at creating new powers for the State.Despite such Acts, headline crime has risen by 10% since 1985, while the number of gardaí per head of population fell from one to 331 to one to 360 in the same period. The number of headline crimes per head of population increased during that period from 39 to 40 incidents per head, as the following figures indicate. In 1985, the number of headline crimes was 91,285. The population was 3.54 million so the rate of headline crime per head of population was 39:1. Garda manpower then stood at 10,700 giving a rate of one garda for every 331 people. In 2004, the number of headline crimes rose from 91,285 to 100,000. The population had risen to 4.04 million so the rate of headline crime per head of population was 40:1. As Garda manpower then stood at 11,248, the number of people for every garda had risen to 360.1:1.Throughout that period and every time there is an outcry about crime, we are promised new legislation. These laws apply to all citizens, be they law-abiding or law breakers. In most years, these laws were passed at a rate of two or three per year, but in 1997, four such Acts were passed, in 1990, five, and in 1993, six.The State must keep abreast of new forms of crime and must equip its institutions to tackle criminals. However, we must also remember that we live in a democracy and the rights of law-abiding citizens must also be protected. There are too many examples of how Governments and their agencies can abuse power, both in Ireland and abroad. The Constitution requires that there be checks and balances to protect the public interest. Therefore, I suggest that a special committee of the Law Reform Commission be set up to audit annually the compendium of laws that have been passed to address various issues whenever Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come under pressure.Last year, I asked the Minister to set out——Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I do not have time to list the 20 pieces of legislation that were passed between 1985 and 2005, but they are on the record in a reply from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to a parliamentary question I tabled earlier in the year. If we put those 20 pieces of legislation into four or five different Acts rather than implement them incrementally, Members would wonder why there was so much law and no order. What does this law do to law-abiding citizens? It does not make the hardened criminal shake in his shoes.We need to strike a balance. I have never apologised for believing firmly in law and order, but all law and no order is not the solution. I ask the Minister and Members of the House to give some thought to this. Some 43 legislative measures were supposed to deal with crime, but the crime level rose and the number of gardaí per head of population decreased. There is something seriously wrong there. The Minister and his Department have a constitutional duty to protect the good name and character of law-abiding citizens and we do not want to give powers to people to supervise those who are not breaking the law, nor to intervene with them in any secretive way. I have no problem with any law enacted by the Minister in order to deal with criminals, but he must make sure the safeguards are there for law-abiding people.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill, as justice is an area about which I feel strongly. As public representatives, our offices are inundated every day with issues about justice. This is a very complex Bill and the explanatory memorandum outlines its details, but it is worthwhile and it gives us an opportunity to put some facts on the record.The Bill is entitled an Act to amend and extend the powers of the Garda Síochána in relation to the investigation of offences, to amend criminal law and procedure in other respects, including provision for the admissibility in evidence of certain witness statements, an extension of the circumstances in which the Attorney General in the case or, if he or she is the prosecuting authority in a trial, the Director of Public Prosecutions may refer a question of law to the Supreme Court for determination or take an appeal in criminal proceedings, a restriction of the offences to which section 10(4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 applies, an amendment of the jurisdiction of the District Court in criminal matters, the imposition of fixed charges in respect of certain offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, an amendment of the requirements for the issue of a firearms certificate and an amendment of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 relating to the issue and execution of certain warrants, and to provide for related matters. The Bill proposes a number of amendments to the criminal law, particularly in the area of criminal investigations, which will enhance Garda powers in tackling crime and will generally improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system.It is one thing to enhance the powers of the Garda, but without a sufficient number of gardaí on our streets, little can be achieved by giving extra powers to existing gardaí. In my constituency of Tipperary South, a sizeable country town like Fethard has a mere two gardaí. It had three gardaí in 1997, when the Government came to power, which is proof that this country is going backwards rather than forwards on justice issues. The Minister talks quite a bit about increasing the number of gardaí to 14,000 members on a phased basis, but in Fethard, the gardaí are being phased out in a town that is growing. At a time when crime is rampant, one cannot pick up a local newspaper without reading about another spate of robberies or petty vandalism. However, the people of Fethard must be feeling very insecure as their safety is in the hands of this Government. A number of Oireachtas Members were called to a public meeting only three weeks ago in Fethard. A packed local hall was told of incident after incident and of how many people are living in fear in the town. In my regular weekly clinic last Monday, three people came to me to complain about anti-social behaviour in the town. To expect two gardaí to look after a town the size of Fethard is very unfair. There is a number of small Garda stations near Fethard which have been closed. That meeting brought home to me the fear in which many people, especially the elderly, are living in their communities. It is grossly unfair that when lifestyles have improved everywhere, the quality of life for some has not improved as they are living in fear.Clonmel is a large town of 24,500 people. Unfortunately, it has been dogged by vandalism and anti-social behaviour, yet the number of gardaí in the town has increased by a mere two members during the lifetime of this Government. This is not good enough. Without a sufficient number of gardaí on our streets, a small number of thugs are empowered to terrorise decent people and rob them in their homes and businesses.Robbery is rampant in rural Ireland. In many cases, I suspect they are committed by people seeking money to feed a bad drug habit.The insufficient number of gardaí has undoubtedly contributed significantly to the flood of drugs coming here. Every small town and village is affected by the drugs scourge these days. In fairness, with the meagre resources available, the Garda has done a fine job in tackling the drug epidemic but more resources are badly needed. Every now and then the Garda seizes a large consignment of drugs, which is to be welcomed. This shows it can carry out first class surveillance and intelligence operations, especially in respect of drugs. However, a significant amount of illegal drugs are still making their way here, largely due to under-resourcing of the Garda Síochána.Drugs tear families and communities apart. Small time dealers operate all over the country who are often beholden to the serious criminal gangs importing drugs here. The drugs trade is giving criminal gangs a foothold in every town and village in Ireland. Sadly, my own constituency of Tipperary South is as affected by the drugs scourge as everywhere else. Parents are worried about their children. They need to know there are enough gardaí on the streets to deal with the drugs problem effectively. Until we have a sufficient number of gardaí on our streets, Criminal Justice Bills, such as the one before the House, will do very little. If gardaí were on the street dealing with the drug problems things would not be as bad as they are.It pains me every time I hear people say somebody's money was got from drugs or such a person bought something with money made from drugs. The rumour machine is working in every town and village about where people are getting their money. The gardaí need resources to tackle this problem. I have said before in this House that the drugs scourge is not being tackled. This is a very worrying development which is not being seriously tackled. It is not a political issue. Some weeks ago the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, spoke about the issue in certain parts of Dublin city and in country towns. Drugs are a scourge tearing communities and families apart. Parents do not know or understand the extent of the problem until their children become involved with drugs when they go to college or go out into the workforce.The drug problem is the most serious issue facing us and it requires to be tackled urgently. The problem is worldwide. Some years ago we were considered to be very fond of drink and there was a significant problem with alcoholism. The late Fr. Theobald Mathew, a native of my constituency, tackled that problem. We need somebody like him or some Government institution to tackle the drug problem. We must educate parents on the problems associated with drugs. More importantly, the problems related to drugs and drug taking must be brought home to young people in universities and night clubs. If anything comes from debate, it must be the need to introduce legislation on this matter and the need to have a figurehead or a Government agency to deal with this terrible problem.In Carrick-on-Suir the number of gardaí in the town has remained static at 16 members since the Government came into office. Likewise, the figure remains static in Tipperary town at 31. Where is the evidence in South Tipperary that this Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cares about people's needs? Where Garda numbers have increased, the increase has been pathetic. The number of gardaí was increased from 12 to 14 in Cashel. This is most unfair to the people of South Tipperary. When will South Tipperary have sufficient numbers of gardaí to ensure that justice is administered comprehensively?The sad situation in the urban areas of South Tipperary is matched by a similar lack of resources in our villages. Right across my constituency, which the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley knows, rural Garda stations from Emly to Grangemockler are unattended most of the week. The closure of those Garda stations is unacceptable. The local Garda station should be a focal point of the village community, no different to the church, school or hurling pitch. The local Garda station was always part of the fabric of the rural community. People depended on it and they went to the local garda. Young people had confidence in the local garda. We are missing out on a very key aspect of policing when we neglect those stations, of which there are many throughout the country. A small amount of resources could make it practical for a garda to work out of each one.There is an important community aspect to the work of local gardaí. A garda in the locality can get to know young people, their habits, faults and failings. When I went to school, we had a very healthy respect for the two gardaí stationed in my local community. At that time 80 children were in the local school. Although there are now 160 children in the school, there is no garda there. It is pathetic that this is allowed to happen. In addition to more rural Garda stations we need more gardaí on the beat in very town.If we had more gardaí on the beat they would build up a better relationship with people, especially young people. The presence of the gardaí late at night when people are socialising would deter disorderly behaviour and could thwart criminals in their activities. Garda morale is at an all-time low under the Government. Instead of concentrating the few garda we have in tackling serious criminality, gardaí are standing on busy streets checking simple things like tax discs and speed, all important matters, but what affects people most is the widespread criminality. Priority must be given to protecting people as that is most important in the work of the Garda.

I was honoured to act on behalf of the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, as one of five envoys helping to do the groundwork for a summit outcome that would reinforce the multilateral system and enhance the capacity of the United Nations to address the threats and challenges of the 21st century.The Secretary General's recommendations for a decision at the summit were based on the premises that without development there can be no security, without security there can be no development and without respect for human rights there can be neither. While the summit outcome did not contain everything we would have wished, it nonetheless contains important commitments and agreements on critical issues in these areas. It also sets out a programme of reform of the United Nations, and its secretariat, to better equip it to meet today's challenges and help enhance political and public confidence in the organisation.The outcome unequivocally commits states to the millennium development goals. Donor countries agreed to step up efforts on official development assistance, financing for development, and debt. Developing countries are committed to ensuring the effective use of assistance through sound development policies, good governance and the rule of law. The imperative to meet the special needs of Africa and to combat HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases was acknowledged.As Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach in his address to the summit committed Ireland to reaching the UN official development assistance target of 0.7% of GNI by 2012, which is three years ahead of the EU target, and to reaching an interim target of 0.5% by 2007.The summit reached important decisions in the area of security. It reaffirmed the authority and primary responsibility of the Security Council to mandate coercive action. It supported the efforts of the European Union and other regional bodies to develop peace support capacities. The significant decision to establish a peace-building commission by the end of this year will help countries emerging from conflict to avoid a return to strife.The General Assembly has been mandated to complete and adopt a counter-terrorism strategy on the lines proposed by the Secretary General and to conclude without delay the negotiation of a comprehensive international convention on terrorism.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Leaders reaffirmed universal human rights and agreed on the need to strengthen the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. The collective acknowledgment of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity is an important concrete achievement of the summit. Leaders decided to double the budget of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to enable it better to assist states to implement their obligations to their citizens. The summit decided in principle to establish a human rights council to replace the Commission on Human Rights and to complete negotiations on its establishment as soon as possible. A key concern for Ireland is that the positive aspects of the Commission on Human Rights, particularly the involvement of civil society, should be preserved. The summit also supported the Secretary General in his efforts to strengthen the UN's secretariat and management, and invited him to make further proposals in this regard.In light of these valuable and far-sighted commitments and decisions, it is deeply disappointing that the outcome is silent on disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and on the need to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT. The UN Secretary General has described this failure as "inexcusable". The Taoiseach made it clear at the summit that he agreed with him, as did I at the General Assembly. Efforts to strengthen and ensure respect for all the provisions of the NPT, which remains the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament, must remain our highest priority as we pursue the twin and mutually reinforcing aims of disarmament and non-proliferation.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	301	There was not a mention of the issue I raised in my question, namely, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the failure to reach agreement thereon. I offer my sympathy to the Minister because of the fact the summit was such a disappointment, despite his best efforts as a special envoy for Kofi Annan. The opportunity of a generation has been squandered because there was no agreement on reform of the Security Council, the five members of which can still veto any reform. There was no agreement on debt crisis management, except an acknowledgement that the issue has not been resolved. There was no agreement on trade reform, which has been left for the conference in Hong Kong.One of the most serious failures is that there was no agreement at all on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Does the Minister agree that the failure in this area is most serious in that it is almost inevitable that nuclear weapons will fall into the hands of elements that owe nothing to democracy or the democratic system? Does he agree that, at some future date, the failure to reach agreement will mean that democratic states will be open to blackmail or threats? Does he agree there is a double standard to the effect that some countries regard themselves as the pillars of democracy while they continue to develop nuclear programmes? These countries are making open and threatening noises towards certain countries about whose nuclear programmes I have reservations but which have the right to develop nuclear energy in a peaceful way.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	302	If I had time to complete my reply, I would have dealt with the issue of non-proliferation. Both the Taoiseach and I referred in our separate addresses to the fact we were very disappointed about the lack of an outcome in respect of the NPT. At a previous review conference on the NPT some months ago, I addressed the General Assembly on behalf of Ireland and referred to the fact that the original treaty was called the Irish treaty. Ireland was the first country asked to sign it. The treaty was, in effect, the brainchild of a predecessor of mine, the former Fianna Fáil Minister Frank Aiken. I said at the UN General Assembly and privately to Kofi Annan that Ireland is ready, willing and able to assist in the continuing efforts to achieve an outcome regarding this issue. As the Deputy may know, there will be a discussion in the General Assembly on all these issues, particularly at the first committee which refers to disarmament and non-proliferation.I do not accept what the Deputy said on the lack of achievement and my involvement in this matter. I was asked specifically to get the European Union to back the proposals so other blocs and countries might follow a similar path. The European Union was the leader in these reforms in respect of the entire remit of the proposals. It is true that there was disagreement at EU level regarding the Security Council, just as there was in every other bloc and area. This is ultimately a matter for the nation states. Members may question the Irish position regarding the Security Council but the decision we took was vindicated. If I had come down on one side or the other, particularly while wearing my hat as UN envoy, it would have placed me in a somewhat invidious position in view of the fact that Kofi Annan had said, time and again, that neither he nor his envoys should involve themselves in the discussion on the Security Council given that the decision thereon was entirely a matter for member states. If we had concentrated on the Security Council, as some states did, it would have been to the detriment of the other topics, which were far more important to ordinary human beings.I do not accept that there were no achievements. There was a very dramatic achievement regarding the peace-building commission. Ireland was a great supporter of this from day one. A complete commitment was made regarding the millennium development goals, which surprised some people. A further dramatic achievement included the commitment to abolish the Commission on Human Rights in favour of a human rights council, which I believe will happen over time. Further progress was made regarding the responsibility to protect principle, which in effect means the types of incidents we saw in Rwanda and Srebrenica will not happen again. I therefore do not accept what Deputy Allen stated. There was a good outcome. As the new President of the General Assembly, a Swede called Jan Eliasson, stated, the achievement of the outcome is a bridgehead for further development regarding all these issues.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	303	Ireland fully supports strict controls on arms and is working within the European Union and at a number of international fora to develop such controls, including an international arms trade treaty, as referred to by the Deputy. There are too many examples of conflicts which are fuelled by the proliferation of conventional weapons. This is especially an issue of concern in Africa, where the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in particular continues to bring much suffering to societies throughout that continent.At present, the export of arms from EU countries must conform to the EU code of conduct on arms exports. Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of this politically binding code, which lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods. These include respect for human rights, the internal conditions in the country of final destination and the preservation of regional peace, security and stability. Discussions are ongoing in the EU on the possible reinforcement of the code of conduct.At UN level, EU member states, including Ireland, actively participated in negotiations which concluded last June with agreement on an international instrument on the tracing of illicit small arms and light weapons. This instrument will help the international community to understand, track and crack down on the illegal trade of these weapons.With regard to the proposed international arms trade treaty, the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its meeting on 3 October acknowledged the growing support throughout the world for an international treaty to establish common standards for the global trade in conventional arms. It also agreed that binding standards, consistent with the existing responsibilities of states under relevant international law, would be critical in tackling proliferation. It was further agreed that the United Nations was the only forum that could deliver a truly universal instrument and the Council called for the start of a formal process at the UN at the earliest opportunity. Given the sensitivity and complexity of the issue, however, the realisation of such an international instrument is likely to be a lengthy process. Ireland will continue to participate fully within the UN and at other international fora to promote the objective of strengthening arms controls globally.

Will he also comment on the significance of the support by 13 countries at the recent meeting at the United Nations for such a treaty? Is it of concern to him that one third of all arms deals in the world now come from the European Union? With the enlarged EU, more than 400 companies are involved in the production and sale of small arms. Is Ireland actively canvassing for the international arms sales treaty? Is he in favour of an induced requirement in terms of the production of armaments which may have dual uses?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Export control is primarily an issue for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is exploring the issue of strengthening controls and legislation in that respect.On the question of whether Ireland is canvassing, I am vocal at all international fora and have been supportive of the proposal at recent EU meetings. While its need is acknowledged, most member states, not least Ireland, fully understand that this treaty should achieve a worldwide spread and account must be taken of the proliferation of small arms. I have figures on the type of financial assistance which we give to efforts around to world to deal with the proliferation of small arms. In the region of 600 million small arms are available worldwide and 300,000 people die from them annually. We are strong on this issue, given that we are a country which does not have an arms trade, and can speak with conviction to it.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Is the Minister concerned that the amount of funds committed to development is about 5% of the annual expenditure on armaments? Some EU countries, including participants in the recent Edinburgh summit, are major exporters of arms, in particular to African countries and sources of conflict. It is not a matter of export being a neutral measure. Arms make their way to third countries through, for example, Yemen with the practical co-operation of countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, France and Italy. These are all leading countries in the discourse on development.The European Union speaks at the United Nations with ashes in its mouth when it has expanded its production and sale of armaments even into conflict zones and at the same time has not completed its review of the 1998 EU code of conduct on transfer of arms. Nor is it implementing an induced requirement, by which I mean allowing armaments, particularly from small companies, into the system without assuming responsibility for where they will eventually be used.

That is why Ireland can speak with some conviction with regard to our place in the world in this respect. I concur that a disproportionate trade exists in this area compared to some of the assistance given. It is also fair to say, however, that between 2003 and 2005 the EU spent in the region of €88 million in efforts to address the issue of excessive quantities of small arms. The code of conduct is being reinforced and discussions are ongoing in that respect.The Deputy may not be aware that there are regular instances where countries refuse licences for the export of arms into other countries because of the principles set down in the existing code.

I am aware a number of recent media reports repeating concerns about the alleged use of Shannon Airport by the US to transit prisoners to Guantanamo Bay and other locations. Although no concrete evidence of such use has been produced, I want to assure the Deputy and the House that these concerns have nevertheless been raised at regular intervals with the US authorities, both through the Embassy of Ireland in Washington and with the US Embassy to Ireland.The Government has on several occasions made clear to the US authorities that it would be illegal to transit prisoners for rendition purposes through Irish territory without the express permission of the Irish authorities, acting in accordance with Irish and international law. The US authorities, for their part, have confirmed that they have not done so and that they would not do so without seeking the permission of the Irish authorities. No request for such authorisation has been received from the US authorities. The assurances provided by the US authorities in this regard were once again confirmed at a meeting with my officials last week.If any citizen or other person has specific evidence that Shannon Airport or any other Irish airport is being used for the purposes described by the Deputy, I of course reiterate the call of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that this evidence be shared with the Garda authorities responsible for investigating such matters.

All the evidence we have accumulated seems to suggest this is the case. It seems the Government is once again adopting a hypocritical line of "see no evil, hear no evil" regarding the US. We know that 70% of US troops in Iraq have passed through Shannon Airport. The Minister does not accept that we are complicit in that war, but most Irish people believe we are hand in glove with the United States, and that this is the case in this regard. Did the Prime Minister of Denmark, which is a member of NATO, not make it clear to the CIA that its airspace, not to mention its airports, could not be used by the US for such activities?The Minister said there have been media reports, which there most certainly have been. Has the UN been in contact with the Minister's Department as part of the ongoing investigation into renditions? If so, what has been the Minister's response?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I can confirm that the Office of the Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights has been in contact with the Department to confirm that neither he nor anyone on his behalf is currently investigating or inquiring into this matter. He did that on the basis of media reports that appeared in the Irish media. His office got in touch with us to confirm that they were not in any way contacting us. My officials contacted his office yesterday to confirm if anyone has been in contact since he made contact with us over two weeks ago. There has been no complaint in this respect.Deputy Gormley said the Irish Government is complicit in the conflict in Iraq, but that is not the case.

I am a democrat and accept the democratic voice in this regard.The 50 year practice in regard to the transiting of troops through Shannon Airport which has been used in different conflicts was approved by the Dáil in 2003. Is the Deputy suggesting that we board and check every plane?

Every time this matter has been raised in the media and in this House my officials have contacted the US Embassy and people in Washington and on every occasion they have said that there has been no such transiting. They have said that they do not intend to do so and that if they did, they would ask the Irish authorities about that. They have given that guarantee whether it be Shannon or any other airport. We accept their word like we accepted the word of any other country in regard to such transiting. Did we stop any of the Russian planes transiting through Shannon when they were going to Cuba for many years? We did not because we accepted that the conditions under which they were flying through Shannon were in place. In the case of the US which has given huge amounts of financial support to this country, are we to turn around and deny what US officials, speaking on behalf of a sovereign government, have told us? We would not do so. If the Deputy was on this side of this House with some of the parties to which his party is cosying up, is he saying he would adopt a different attitude to not only accepting the US Government's word but to continuing to allow what is happening at Shannon?

The Minister said we have to take people's word in this regard. We took people's word for this on previous occasions when we were told categorically, and I would like him to confirm this, that there were no weapons going through Shannon, but a number of observers there saw that the troops were carrying weapons with them and the Minister had to do a U-turn on that point. If the Minister had the bottle to arrange for the carrying out of searches on these planes, I am convinced he would find that people are being transported to Guantanamo Bay. Why will he not arrange for the carrying out of searches on these planes?

No evidence has been brought to our attention by anybody who has made such allegations and, furthermore, we have not received any such evidence. When the US Government gives us categoric assurances in this regard, as it did no later than last week, we accept them.The conditions of transit are the conditions which have been in place in regard to many conflicts such as that in Kosovo and those in many other countries. These facilities have been allowed over the years in regard to conflicts in Lebanon, Vietnam, Granada, Panama, Kuwait, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo and Korea. These facilities were only allowed on strict conditions, the same conditions as have pertained for 50 years.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Under the Government's decentralisation programme, announced in December 2003, the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, currently based in Dublin, is scheduled to decentralise to Limerick. This will involve the relocation to Limerick of 123 posts and is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007. The Office of Public Works is currently assessing a number of accommodation proposals in Limerick.A detailed implementation plan was completed by my officials in March of this year and submitted to the Flood committee for its consideration. The plan addresses a wide variety of issues, including human resource considerations, training and development, business issues, risk management and accommodation needs. The plan, together with regular updates, can be accessed on the Department's website.Already, a total of 26 posts in the directorate are filled by staff who have expressed an interest in decentralising to Limerick, including seven officers recruited from other Departments via the central applications facility and five staff recruited from interdepartmental promotion panels. The process of transferring to the directorate staff currently serving elsewhere in the Department and of recruiting staff via the central applications facility will be accelerated in the new year. The aim is that by the second half of 2006 most posts in the directorate will be filled by staff who will decentralise to Limerick.The Government is aware that the decentralisation process will take place during a period of significant growth in the overseas development aid budget and the strategies outlined in the implementation plan are designed to minimise these risks. The following are among the steps being taken. To ensure continuity and to minimise disruption, Department officials are currently involved in detailed planning on strategies for retaining corporate memory and ensuring there is adequate training and induction for new staff. To guard against a very rapid turnover of staff in the months immediately preceding decentralisation to Limerick, Development Co-operation Ireland has already started the process of bringing staff in from other Departments who have applied for decentralisation with Development Co-operation Ireland.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Development Co-operation Ireland's work involves liaising with other sections of the Department of Foreign Affairs, other Departments, NGOs such as Concern, Trócaire and GOAL and a wide range of international organisations. In order to ensure this important networking continues, a liaison office will remain in Dublin following decentralisation. In addition, the Department will invest in video-conferencing facilities. Development Co-operation Ireland is consulting other Departments who have experienced decentralisation, for example, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in Limerick and the UK Department for International Development which relocated some of its operations from London to Glasgow in the early 1980s.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	348	If I am reading the Minister of State's figures properly the situation appears to have worsened since his last answer in June. He said then that 21 applications had been made from within the directorate to the Central Applications Facility, which indicated that about 17% of the staff had taken up the offer of decentralisation, which is a minuscule level. Now he says there are 26, but six of those are coming from somewhere else within the Department, which makes the situation even worse.Is the Minister of State aware that the Ireland Aid review committee in its 2002 report said that the loss of key staff within the directorate would affect seriously the efficiency of the aid programme? Has he carried out any risk assessment as regards the erosion of key staff within the directorate? If so, what were the findings of that assessment? Will he say how many sites are being looked for the decentralisation programme and what is the projected cost of site acquisition?My key question, however, is concerned with risk assessment. How many of the 15 principal officer and senior specialists are in favour of moving?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	349	To take the last part of the Deputy's question first, I do not get myself involved directly in the identification of a location or site for this particular office. Clearly that is a matter for the Office of Public Works. The Department is very happy to allow the OPW to continue to handle that aspect. It has identified a number of sites. I cannot shed any light for the Deputy on the value of the Limerick site——
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	350	So the Minister of State does not know where he is going.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	353	What about principal officers and senior officials?

My officials have been to Limerick and have looked at a number of different sites identified by the OPW.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Were they from within the directorate?

The Deputy issued a statement earlier today, and this is fully understandable, deriving the figure of 17%. In fact 33% of the required level of staffing that we need——
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	357	It is not a political lie.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I read it from the Minister of State's reply on 2 June.

The Central Applications Facility would not reflect the numbers of staff to move within DCI from overseas, or indeed people who did not come through the CAF and came into the Department on promotion. Indeed, in the last few months five people have come into the Department on promotion and indicated a strong willingness to decentralise to Limerick. Of the senior development specialists he referred to, none of the current three officials has indicated a desire to relocate to Limerick.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	361	What about the principal officers and specialists?

I understand the figure is in the region of 11 or more among the development specialists who have indicated a willingness to go to Limerick.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Out of how many?

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The protection of human rights and the promotion of equality is at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement. This was collectively affirmed by the parties in the commitment in the agreement to "the mutual respect, the civil rights and the religious liberties of everyone in the community". This included in particular "the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed, disability, gender or ethnicity".The Government has consistently sought to pursue the equality agenda set out in the agreement and which was further elaborated in the Joint Declaration by the British and Irish Governments in April 2003.The Government actively monitors the situation on the ground in Northern Ireland as regards discrimination and inequality. This is done through regular official level engagement with community contacts, with political representatives, members of the NGO and academic community and with representatives of the relevant official bodies, such as the Equality Commission and the Human Rights Commission. These measures are effective, equipping us to actively advance the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in the equality area.During my own frequent visits to Northern Ireland I make a point of meeting individuals and community representatives from both traditions. These visits are a very valuable direct source of information, including of course on equality issues.In keeping with the high priority which the Government attaches to the equality agenda, we use the institutional framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and meetings of the conference to engage with the British Government on the implementation of the equality provisions in the Good Friday Agreement and the joint declaration. Equality issues are a regular item on the agenda for ministerial and summit meetings of the conference, as the communiqués of those meetings make clear.Overall, while there has been some progress, we should like to see more — especially as regards the employment differential and the allocation of public housing. The issue was discussed at the last meeting of the BIIGC and will be pursued further at the next meeting planned for later this month. We will, of course, continue to keep individual cases under review and raise them, as appropriate, through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.

In March 2005 he said that the type of discrimination that took place in previous decades had all but disappeared. Last month he was quoted speaking about "endemic unemployment in loyalist areas which is not as clear cut in nationalist areas, where perhaps the ability to advance individuals because of their education has not been the same in loyalist areas". Does the Minister stand over those comments now? Will he agree that anybody who made such comments, despite the reality of the situation, well-documented by British statistics, is blind to inequality, blind to discrimination and blind to religion?It is naive to suggest that the existence of anti-discrimination legislation translates into the disappearance of discrimination. Is the Minister aware of the most recent statistics published by the British authorities? I will give him a copy. It gives a full list, area by area, with an indicator by indicator on every one of them. Those communities regarded as Catholic and Nationalist are less well off than their counterparts in loyalist or Protestant areas. I can quote a number of them, but it is sufficient to say that Catholics were twice as likely to be unemployed in 2004 as those who lived in Protestant areas.The differential has increased since 1990. Northern Ireland Housing Executive figures for the period 2002 to 2005 show under-allocation to Catholics of 16% and over-allocation to Protestants of 21%. Other similar figures have also been published. On every indicator relating to objective need Catholics are shown to be worse off. Does the Minister not agree that objective need should be the only criterion governing the allocation of funding to communities and informing equality building measures as stipulated in the Good Friday Agreement?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	382	Yes, objective criteria should be used. Polarisation is not needed in this type of debate. I accept that inequality is wrong no matter where it is found. I made my earlier comments in the context of the type of discrimination against Nationalists, which was endemic for decades in Northern Ireland, being all but eliminated as a result of the legislation now in place. Northern Ireland probably has more legislation on discrimination than any other country in Western Europe and is probably watched more than any other society in that respect. In recent years, significant progress has been made in addressing discrimination against Nationalists and Catholics across all areas.On the general level of discrimination and inequality, which Deputy Ó Snodaigh also raised, the Government raises these issues time and again. I have raised them at every meeting I have had with the Northern authorities, whether in the person of the Secretary of State, Peter Hain, or his officials, and will raise them again at the British Irish Intergovernmental Body which will meet towards the end of the month.With regard to my comments on deprivation in loyalist areas, even Deputy Ó Snodaigh will accept that in recent decades many people from loyalist areas have completed their education and moved to the UK. By failing to return they have, to an extent, denuded loyalist areas of people who have advanced in society, leaving behind those who cannot get jobs. In Nationalist communities, on the other hand, those who have obtained third level degrees have remained in Northern Ireland and have been a great resource to their communities not only through their community work but simply by staying in their communities. It is important that we be even-handed in all these matters. These problems are less a result of conflict than social and economic difficulties present in Northern Ireland and perhaps not as stark in the South. They are particularly acute in loyalist communities where people used to be guaranteed jobs for life in industries to which Catholics may not have had access. The fact that this is no longer the case causes difficulties in loyalist areas. We must try to understand the difficulties faced by both communities. We raise these matters with the Northern authorities at every meeting to ensure the principles of the Good Friday Agreement are expressed in legislation.

While monitoring is well and good, what additional function can the Government undertake to advance equality for Irish citizens in the Six Counties and reduce the rate of unemployment in Catholic and Nationalist areas? The disparity between these and other areas appears to be increasing. If we are to believe British Government statistics, other indicators of social need, as expressed in the percentages affected in Nationalist and Unionist areas, show that Nationalists are worse off now than they were ten or 15 years ago.

In 1990 unemployment was higher in Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom. The unemployment rate in Catholic and Protestant areas has since fallen dramatically and is now lower than the average UK rate. While significant pockets of unemployment remain and significant differences remain in the ratio of Catholics to Protestants unemployed, the figures are improving. I received figures on the PSNI, for example, which show the number of Catholics in the police has dramatically improved in recent years.Monitoring and assessment of all these indicators continues right across the spectrum and liaison between officials from the South and their Northern counterparts is continuous with a view to ensuring equality remains high on the agenda. I welcome the recent appointment of Mr. Bob Collins as chairman of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.

The central premise of the Secretary General's recommendations was that "we will not enjoy development without security, we will not enjoy security without development, and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights." Against this background, and among other proposals, he recommended that the existing Commission on Human Rights, CHR, be replaced with a smaller standing human rights council. The Secretary General justified this on the basis of his view that the CHR suffers from declining credibility and professionalism and is in need of major reform.In the view of the Secretary General, the creation of a human rights council would accord human rights a more authoritative position, corresponding to the primacy of human rights in the Charter of the United Nations. He stated it would be for member states to determine the exact status and composition of the council. In contacts with foreign minister colleagues in pursuit of my role as envoy of the Secretary General in the lead up to the summit it was clear to me that there was a broad measure of support for the Secretary General's report, not only in the wider Europe but also beyond. However, this support was not universal.Together with our European Union partners, Ireland warmly welcomed the Secretary General's proposals which we regarded as an opportunity to strengthen the United Nations human rights machinery. As the Secretary General stated, it would elevate human rights to a more authoritative position within the UN system. A key objective for the EU has been and will remain that the human rights council should preserve the best features of the Commission on Human Rights. These include its country and thematic special procedures and NGO participation, as well as the right of human rights defenders to call Governments to account.The European Union, under the Luxembourg and UK Presidencies, maintained this position in the negotiations with other states in the lead up to the summit. However, as other states had different views on aspects of the Secretary General's proposal, it was not possible to reach complete agreement in advance of the summit. Nonetheless, the outcome document agreed at the summit commits member states to create a human rights council. There is as yet no agreement on whether the council should be a principal organ of the UN or a subsidiary body of the General Assembly. It will be responsible for promoting universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner. It will address violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations, and make recommendations thereon. It will also promote effective co-ordination and the mainstreaming of human rights within the UN system.The summit outcome mandated the president of the General Assembly to conduct negotiations to establish the mandate, functions, size, composition and other institutional aspects of the council and the process of discussion is now beginning.

Amnesty International, for example, described it as a betrayal of human rights. What is the Government's view of the final outcome? What will be the Government's priorities in terms of the negotiations on the out-workings of this council?The Minister has also stated in the past that implementation of the UN change agenda would be a major priority over the coming months. I argued consistently here for a debate on UN reform prior to the summer recess. We did not manage a proper debate; we had a short debate. How will the Minister engage with this House and the Irish people on the UN change agenda suggested? What will he do to ensure people at local level feel ownership of the UN, the process of change and that which is suggested for the future? I suggest he might talk to the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who undertook public meetings on development aid which worked well. That is a model which might be suggested for use in the case of UN reform.

At present, it is a subsidiary body of ECOSOC and we believe it should be raised in order to raise the aspect of human rights to a higher level. There are issues as to whether it should be done, as currently, by a simple majority or by a two thirds majority. There are issues on the size of it also. The one good aspect of it is that it will be a standing body which will meet on a constant basis rather than on a six weeks per year basis as is the case with the existing commission. While the outcome document does not flesh out what the structures of this should be, the fact that the entire membership of the United Nations has agreed to replace the existing commission means, in effect, there is a death sentence hanging over the existing commission, and they know that.The leadership of the new chairman, Mr. Jan Eliasson, who succeeds an excellent chairman, Mr. Jean Ping, is particularly relevant. Mr. Jan Eliasson is from Sweden where, as Deputies will be aware, the issue of human rights is strongly held. He has complimented Ireland on our stance on this particular aspect and has said to me on many occasions that when Ireland speaks on UN issues he can welcome everything we say. We are regarded as a strong ally on the reform agenda. As I stated previously on an earlier question, we will give any further assistance possible in that respect.

The roadmap requires action by both parties, including a freeze on all Israeli settlement activity in the Palestinian territories.The Government has consistently taken the view that the transfer by an occupying power of its own population into occupied territory constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The establishment of settlements by the Israeli authorities in the occupied Palestinian territories, including in east Jerusalem, is contrary to international law. The Government has conveyed its concerns on settlement activity directly to the Israeli Government on many occasions. I raised them when I met with Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom in Jerusalem on 12 July.It is the clear position of the European Union that the parties must comply with international law, and that no party should take any unilateral measure which prejudges questions relating to final status. The EU will not recognise any change to the 1967 borders other than those negotiated between the parties. In my address to the UN General Assembly on 19 September, I specifically called on Israel to desist completely from any further steps which could jeopardise the viability of the two-state solution.I remain concerned at recent announcements by the Israeli Government regarding plans for the enlargement of settlements in the West Bank and the expansion of the boundaries of east Jerusalem. As Deputies will be aware, the Government is also seriously concerned at the continued construction of the separation barrier on occupied territory, which represents an obstacle to the implementation of the roadmap and, therefore, to the prospects for a lasting settlement.These concerns are shared by the international community. At its most recent meeting at ministerial level, on 20 September, the international quartet reiterated its concern at settlement expansion and at the route of the separation barrier, noting that it appears to prejudge the final borders of a Palestinian state.The most recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended in Luxembourg on 3 October, welcomed the successful completion of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the West Bank as a significant step towards implementation of the roadmap. The council also expressed grave concern at the ongoing expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the continuing construction of the separation barrier in occupied Palestinian territory. The conclusions adopted specifically refer to the situation in and around east Jerusalem, which is having a detrimental effect on the lives of Palestinians and jeopardises a final status agreement on Jerusalem.The Government, and its partners in the EU, will continue to work closely with Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the period ahead to encourage them to build on the progress of disengagement, to meet their obligations under the quartet roadmap, and to renew efforts towards a lasting settlement based on the terms of the roadmap.

I was referring specifically to the recently recognised town of Ma'ala Adumim, which was founded in 1975 and which has a population of 25,000.The conclusions of the meeting on 3 October to which the Minister referred make no reference to the illegality of the expansion of settlement in the general area of east Jerusalem. The issue is that 8,000 settlers were removed from Gaza and from four settlements in the northern part of the occupied West Bank. Some 35,000 housing permissions were given between September 2004 and September 2005 across 19 different occupied areas in the general area of east Jerusalem, the net effect of which is to cut off Bethlehem from Ramallah.I put it to the Minister that it endangers three fundamentals, namely, the final status of talks relating to Israel and Palestine, the viability of the Palestinian state and the future of east Jerusalem. The settlement policy of the Israeli authorities should be the central element of a European Union statement in which the illegality of the expansion of that settlement policy should be mentioned. I was in Ramallah just after the anniversary of the International Court of Justice ruling on the war. People asked what Europe is doing about the vindication of the decision of the International Court of Justice, which is just over a year old.

I said earlier that we believe continued expansion of the settlements is illegal and contrary to international law. We have said the same with regard to the wall. This is an extremely complex issue. Ultimately, the only way we can bring any stability to this area is through negotiation. Those negotiations are ongoing. Presidents Abbas and Sharon will meet later this week, which is welcome because there is some understanding.There are issues, for example, the continuing expansion and the construction of the wall. I saw the wall when I was there in July and I raised the matter with Foreign Minister Shalom. He said it was a temporary structure but what I saw did not look temporary. He said it was a structure that could be taken down when matters settled and his people were safe. I made the point to him that it looked extremely like a permanent structure. I assure the Deputy that we participate strongly and fully at European level with regard to this situation. The significant removal of settlements from Gaza must be welcomed. However, it should not be seen as an end, but as a first step towards the implementation of the roadmap.

What is effectively being extended beyond east Jerusalem is half the size of Paris. The net effect will be to cut off on the north side of the south axis any possibility of a viable Palestinian state. There is no indication in any talks that Israel intends either to halt settlement activity or to remove settlements from occupied land.As an observer, I put it to the Minister that given the status of the talks, the issue of east Jerusalem is probably the most difficult. On the one hand Palestinians, in the absence of a plan for greater Jerusalem, have no housing permission and face the demolition and division of their houses, while on the other hand we have an open-ended expansion of what is referred to as "the thickening of settlements". This is outrageous.There are two systems of law in operation, a military system of law for Palestinians on their land and Israeli law for occupied land that is illegally held and from which settlements are expanding. East Jerusalem and the expanded settlement policy must be put at the centre of discussions. I do not agree with the Minister that one should try to be optimistic, because there are few signs on the Israeli side of the suspension of this activity.

We can only work through international diplomacy on this issue. The quartet has actively condemned this and it would have much more influence in trying to get the Israelis to cease what they are doing, which is contrary to the tenets and principles laid down in the roadmap.

How far must Israel go before Article 2 of the Euro-Med Association agreement with Israel is triggered? The issue does not have any link with the ability of the European Union to offer financial assistance to Palestinians as was stated previously. Has the Minister or a Government representative demonstrated their displeasure or had any communication with the Irish multinational, Cement Roadstone Holdings, in terms of its contribution to breaching international law? CRH is a flagship company in this State. Has the Minister made his displeasure felt or asked CRH to withdraw from any contract for the building of the wall which, at this stage, almost encircles Jerusalem.

It holds a minority shareholding of approximately 25% in the company involved, Nesher Cement. The Government has no power over such private companies.With regard to the Euro-Med Association agreement, Sinn Féin tried to get support from other parties at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs to be even more critical with regard to the association agreement, which, if it were to be suspended, would require consensus within the European Union. From what I understand, it would not get that consensus. There is a strong argument that suspension would seriously undermine the strong role the Union has in this area. It has given and continues to give substantial financial and other support to the Palestinian Authority. If we were to suspend the association agreement, it would put that assistance in jeopardy.

Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of these conclusions, which principally address the recently enacted Colombian justice and peace law. That law provides an overall legal framework for demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into society. The law, which was adopted through a lengthy democratic political process, strikes a difficult balance between peace and justice. The overall assessment of the council was that, if implemented effectively and in a transparent manner, the law will have a positive effect on peace-building in Colombia.The conclusions also address the need for a negotiated peace settlement and call for illegal armed groups to demobilise. They also call on all parties to the conflict to respect human rights and international humanitarian law and commend the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia. The conclusions also confirm the readiness of the European Union and its member states to assist the Colombian Government and civil society in providing support for communities affected by the internal conflict, victims groups, local reconciliation activities and the reinsertion and demobilisation of child soldiers.In addition, the European Union welcomes the continued involvement of the Organisation of American States, OAS, in supporting the demobilisation of paramilitary groups. Ireland has committed €390,000 over a three-year period to the OAS peace and verification mission in Colombia. The OAS mission's mandate is to provide comprehensive support to the Colombian peace process with a focus both on the demobilisation process and on the strengthening of institutions concerned with the rule of law. Our support was welcomed by the Foreign Minister of Colombia when I met her in New York on 19 September. In our discussions of the overall political situation in her country, she explained that her Government has found the Irish experience of similar issues very informative.

Were the activities of the Colombia three resurrected during the EU discussions earlier this week? Did the Minister have any discussions with the Colombian Foreign Minister about the damage done to Ireland's reputation by the activities of the Colombia three? Was the question of possible discrimination against Irish citizens raised at any level? Irish citizens are the only people in the EU who have to apply for visas if they wish to travel to Colombia. They have to go to London for an interview if they wish to visit Colombia for reasons of business or pleasure. Visas are not required by the citizens of 44 non-EU countries if they wish to go to Colombia, but they are required by Irish citizens. Surely the Minister agrees that the visa requirement for Irish citizens is an indication of the damage that has been done to Ireland's reputation as a member of the international community. Has the plight of our citizens, who have to travel to London in advance of any visit to Colombia, been raised at any level? What action does the Minister propose to take on this issue?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The issue of the Colombia three was not raised at EU level, at least not in my presence, during the discussion on the Colombian peace process last Monday. As I said earlier, it was raised during my meeting with the Colombian Foreign Minister, Ms Barco. During that meeting, I outlined the Government's position on the issue, which has been enunciated clearly by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I on many occasions.Deputy Allen also asked about the visa requirements for Irish citizens. It has been the case since November 2001, shortly after the arrest of the Colombia three, that all EU citizens other than Irish citizens can travel to Colombia for tourism and business purposes without a visa. I intend to raise the issue with the Colombian authorities. Colombia no longer has an honorary consul in situ in Ireland, unfortunately, although I understand that it intends to appoint a new honorary consul. In the meantime, it appears that Ireland citizens who want to go to Colombia have to travel to London in advance. I understand that we will revert to the previous arrangements after a new Colombian honorary consul has been appointed in Ireland.

The EU enlargement process provided the impetus for recent efforts to find a settlement, which were made by the UN Secretary General in the first half of 2004, during Ireland's EU Presidency. At that time, Ireland maintained close contact with the relevant various parties to encourage their commitment to the negotiating process and the achievement of an agreed outcome.The accession to the EU of a united Cyprus was not possible on 1 May 2004, as a consequence of the results of the referendums in Cyprus on 24 April 2004. The Republic of Cyprus has been a member state of the EU since 1 May 2004. The application of EU's laws and regulations to the northern part of the island has been suspended in the absence of a comprehensive settlement.In May 2004, the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, submitted a comprehensive report to the UN Security Council on his mission of good offices. He noted that the unsuccessful outcome of the referendum represented another missed opportunity to resolve the Cyprus problem. He concluded that there was no apparent basis for resuming the good offices effort while the stalemate continued.The process has remained under consideration in the Security Council. Following discussions with the Secretary General in May of thisyear, the President of Cyprus, Mr. TassosPapadopoulos, sent an envoy to New York for preliminary and informal talks with senior officials in the UN secretariat. As a result of the discussions, the Secretary General asked the under-secretary general for political affairs, Mr. Kieran Prendergast, to travel to Cyprus, Athens and Ankara to listen to the views of all parties on the future of the mission of good offices on Cyprus. Mr. Prendergast reported to the Security Council in June that despite certain positive elements, the substantive gap between the stated positions of the parties appeared to be too wide. The Secretary General and the UN officials continue to monitor the situation closely. The Government has strongly supported the UN Secretary General, Mr. Annan, in his mission of good offices.I would like to discuss the EU enlargement process. As part of its preparations for the opening of accession negotiations and in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council meeting of December 2004, Turkey signed the Ankara agreement protocol on 29 July last to take account of the accession of the new member states, including the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey also issued a declaration stating that its signature, ratification and implementation of the protocol did not amount to the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus referred to in the protocol. In response, the EU agreed and issued a counter-declaration on 21 September last recalling the status of the Republic of Cyprus as a member state of the EU. The counter-declaration also noted that the recognition of all member states is a necessary part of the accession process. It underlined the importance the EU attaches to the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all member states as soon as possible.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.In the context of the counter-declaration, the EU member states agreed on the importance of supporting the efforts of the UN Secretary General. They agreed that a just and lasting settlement would contribute to peace, stability and harmonious relations in the region. The EU remains ready to accommodate a settlement of the Cyprus problem based on the Secretary General's proposals and in line with the principles on which the Union is founded.

The EU Foreign Ministers made their decision on the basis of a report that was issued to the General Affairs and External Relations Council by Ms Del Ponte.To be fair, the issue of Croatia's accession was not linked at any stage with the issue of Turkey's accession. They were dealt with as two separate issues during the discussions. Ireland's position on the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, which was maintained throughout the EU discussions, is absolutely clear. We do not feel that the opening of negotiations on EU membership with Turkey should be conditional on that country's recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. However, we continue to acknowledge the need to move towards the normalisation of relations between Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus as the accession talks develop.We anticipate that the accession talks will continue for a considerable length of time. The conclusions which were adopted indicate that Turkish accession cannot be countenanced until the acceptance of the next phase of financial perspectives, which will kick into place in 2014. It is recognised and understood that Turkey cannot accede to the EU until it recognises fully all states, including the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey's accession to the EU presupposes, in effect, Turkey's recognition of the Republic of Cyprus.Written answers follow Adjournment debate.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise an extremely important health issue. When I discovered last week that the alcohol products (control of advertising, sponsorship and marketing practices/sales promotions) Bill had disappeared from the list of promised legislation, I raised the issue with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, neither of whom were concerned in the slightest that a major legislative plank of this country's attempts to deal with alcohol abuse had been abandoned.It is strange that they could not have cared less — the same is true of large sections of the media and the main Opposition parties — given the extent of the well-documented problems associated with alcohol. In his indifferent response, the Taoiseach said that self-regulation often works best. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, recently said on RTE that he is convinced the alcohol industry will act responsibly. If the vintners had been allowed to introduce the smoking ban in pubs on the basis of self-regulation, it would never have happened.The Government response is shameful and deeply corrupt. It has bowed to an industry which produces the most harmful drug, albeit a legal one, in Irish society. It is a drug responsible for violence and disorder, serious health problems, marriage breakdown, suicide and depression, absenteeism and major problems in our accident and emergency units. It costs the State millions of euro every year. Yet, the Government has decided to play ball with the producers of this drug. It is nauseating to watch Ministers make sanctimonious statements about drugs like hashish and cocaine, and get cheap publicity for doing so, while at the same time ignoring the main problem. They ignore their own reports, the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol's recommendations and the statements from the previous Minister for Health and Children, who proposed introducing this legislation in 2003. All these recommendations are to be ignored at the behest of the alcohol industry, which the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Power, tell us will act responsibly.What does "acting responsibly" mean? It means showing advertisements and encouraging people to drink while at the same time displaying a small piece of advice to "enjoy alcohol responsibly". We cannot afford to be naive about this. The aim of the alcohol industry is to increase profits and to sell as much alcohol as possible. How is this aim compatible with the aims of the Government, which ought to be concerned first and foremost with the public good and protecting society and public health? However, as we have seen time and again with the Fianna Fáil-PD Administration, profits come before people. This latest U-turn is symptomatic of just how deep the Government has sunk into the corporate mire. No doubt Fianna Fáil and the PDs will benefit handsomely from the drinks industry for the way in which they have kowtowed to these vested interests.It all comes at the cost of society. The alcohol products (control of advertising, sponsorship and marketing practices/sales promotions) Bill was supposed to "protect children and adolescents from over-exposure to alcohol advertising". The new laws were supposed to limit where alcohol advertisements could be placed and introduce a watershed for children on radio, television and cinema. The contents of advertisements were not to appeal to children in any way and there was to be a ban on sponsorship of activities involving young people. The members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children went much further. We said there should be a complete ban on alcohol advertisements, having heard all of the conclusive evidence. We considered the problem of alcohol in some detail and felt we were left with no alternative.The dropping of this legislation raises a fundamental question about the relevance of Parliament. If expert opinions and reports from a joint committee are to be totally ignored by the Government, why are we here? Who calls the shots? Who has the power? Is it the elected representatives or the powerful lobbyists on behalf of vested interests? Surely this is yet another example of why we need to know who is lobbying on behalf of whom, to whom they have spoken and the content of those negotiations. We need a register of lobbyists.The alcohol industry can claim a major victory. The loser is society and this Parliament. This is a sick and corrupt Government. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and her party, the Progressive Democrats, should hang their heads in shame.

However, it is welcome that the Deputy has raised the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to deal with the inaccuracies and nonsense spoken in recent days.The Department of Health and Children and the strategic task force on alcohol had concerns about alcohol advertisements, particularly in regard to content, placement and marketing practices. One of the recommendations of the task force was to reduce the exposure of young people to alcohol advertisements. The Department drafted the heads of a Bill to restrict, not ban, alcohol advertising. The heads were subsequently approved by Government. In parallel with this process, the Department approached representatives from the relevant industries — not the other way around. The representatives from the advertising, drinks, communications and media sectors were informed of the Department's concerns and that legislation was being drafted. The industry acknowledged the concerns and asked for time to respond on an incremental basis.The first response was to establish Central Copy Clearance Ireland, CCCI. The function of this body is to vet the content of alcohol advertisements to ensure adherence to the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, ASAI, codes and the 1995 ministerial broadcast media code. Agreement has been reached with all media — television, radio, cinema etc. — that all alcohol advertisements must carry a CCCI stamp approval number before they will accept it for broadcast or display. The CCCl system has been in place since mid-2003 and has had a significant impact on the number of complaints upheld by the ASAI.In response to the Department's concerns about placement, the industry proposes to introduce a system of audience profiling. It has been agreed that no advertising for alcohol will be booked by the drinks industry or placed by the broadcasters in any programming where more than 33% of the audience is under the age of 18 years. In addition, no advertising for alcohol will be placed in any programming specifically aimed at children or young people. This applies to television, radio and cinema. Some of the agreements reached in regard to outdoor advertising include a restriction that alcohol advertising will not be placed within 100 metres of schools and buses, and bus shelters will not contain wraparound alcohol advertisements.

If the monitoring body reports that the code is not effective, the Department retains the option of reactivating the Bill. If the code is not honoured, we will introduce the legislation.

We have no control over a number of television stations and we do not have the consensus in Europe that was evident in regard to tobacco advertising.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this issue. This case concerns a woman who is seeking Irish citizenship. She was born in England in December 1934, had no Irish parents or grandparents and, therefore, did not have an automatic entitlement to citizenship. She married in June 1967. Her husband was born in February 1916 and was entitled to become, and became, an Irish citizen. Unfortunately, he is now seriously ill.At the time of their marriage the legislation governing nationality and citizenship was the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 which stated "a woman who is an alien at the date of her marriage to a person who is an Irish citizen (otherwise than by naturalisation) shall not become an Irish citizen merely by virtue of her marriage, but may do so by lodging a declaration in the prescribed manner with the Minister or with any Irish diplomatic mission or consular office, either before the marriage, or if lodged thereafter, then from the date of the lodgement."This means that although the woman concerned had an entitlement to acquire Irish citizenship on the basis of her marriage, it would have been necessary for her to take the formal step of making a declaration to exercise that entitlement. As part of this process, her husband would have had to swear an affidavit to support the declaration. Unfortunately, her husband suffers from Alzheimer's and is not in a position to swear the affidavit.The woman has been informed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the only option open to her is to apply for a certificate of naturalisation for which there is a fee of €634.87. The woman's means are limited and it would cause financial difficulty for her to pay this sum. She asked the Minister to waive the fee but he stated he did not have discretion in the matter. This is one of the problems which occasionally arise in the administration of our affairs and where a degree of common sense needs to be applied. There seems to be no doubt but that the woman is entitled to citizenship. If the declaration could be made, she would get it automatically. I understand the Department's position is that if she pays the fee for a certificate of naturalisation, her case will be processed quite quickly.We should look at this case in context. This is a country where in recent years people have arrived with lots of money and have, in effect, been able to buy citizenship. If one had a few million euro which one could put into a company or in an investment scheme, one could, effectively, buy citizenship. As we know, some of the citizenships and passports were purchased in rather doubtful circumstances.However, this case involves a woman who is married to an Irish citizen, who has lived here most of her life, has contributed to Irish life and community and whose husband, who is now ill, contributed over his working life to the State. She is effectively being denied citizenship by a particularly rigid interpretation of the rules. I understand the difficulties civil servants have in administering the rules made and the legislation passed by this House. Will the Minister exercise some discretion in this area?I suggest either of two ways to deal with this. One is to waive the fee for the certificate of naturalisation, which the Minister said he cannot do. The other is to accept medical certification in respect of the woman's husband explaining that he is not in a position to swear the affidavit required to make the declaration and on that basis to admit the application. There is no dispute about the facts of this particular case. On the basis of pure morality, the woman is entitled to, and should get, citizenship. It is unfair to her and, indeed, to her husband who is not in a position to deal with it to have it blocked on this technicality.I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to respond positively. I appreciate he has a script from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which may well tell me what I already know but I ask him to ask the Minister and the Department to exercise a little common sense and to give this woman what she is perfectly entitled to, namely, an Irish passport and citizenship based on her marriage.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I will convey the suggestions and thoughts of Deputy Gilmore to the Minister, Deputy McDowell. Let me say at the outset on behalf of the Minister, who cannot be here this evening, that he is sympathetic to the situation of the person concerned and has, with his officials, examined all possible avenues to assist her in obtaining Irish citizenship.Section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that a non-national who is married to an Irish citizen, who is Irish other than by naturalisation, post-nuptial citizenship or honorary citizenship, for a period of at least three years, may lodge a declaration with the Minister accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship. The marriage must be subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declaration. Furthermore, the couple must be living together as husband and wife and the Irish spouse has to submit an affidavit to that effect when the declaration is being lodged.The person concerned has been married to an Irish citizen for almost 40 years and in the normal course would be entitled to make such a declaration. However, the medical condition of the person's Irish husband appears to rule out the possibility of him being able to make the affidavit that he and his wife are living together as husband and wife. The Deputy has confirmed this in correspondence to the Department. As a result, the person concerned cannot lodge her declaration of Irish citizenship. The Minister has asked me to emphasise that the requirement for the affidavit is set down in law and he does not have any discretionary powers to waive this requirement.It appears, therefore, that the only option for the person concerned to obtain Irish citizenship is through the process of naturalisation. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts specify a number of requirements with which an applicant for naturalisation has to comply, including having a period of residency in the State prior to applying, being of good character and having an intention to reside in the State once naturalised. The Minister is empowered to waive some or all of these statutory conditions in certain circumstances. One of these circumstances is where the applicant is of Irish descent or, as in the case concerned, Irish associations.It is clear to the Minister that this is a case where he should exercise his discretionary powers to the fullest extent possible, notwithstanding the fact that the person concerned may, of course, qualify for naturalisation in her own right. He has already indicated to the Deputy that he is favourably disposed to grant an application for naturalisation and he will also ensure that any such application, because of the unusual circumstances in this case, will be prioritised.However, the person concerned would have to apply in the normal way and her application would be assessed against the statutory provisions in place. Following formal approval of her application, she would be required to swear, in open court, an oath of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. She would also be required to pay a statutory fee of €634.87. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Fees) Regulations 1993, as amended, set out the fees for citizenship and the fee appropriate to the situation of the person concerned is €634.87. These regulations do not allow the Minister to waive the statutory fees under any circumstances.

If the person concerned wishes to proceed with an application for naturalisation, she or the Deputy can contact the Minister's departmental office. The person concerned can then be put in touch with one of the Minister's officials from the citizenship section of the Department who will guide her through the application process. I have dealt before with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, on matters of this kind.

It is somewhat unreasonable that some resolution cannot be reached if the lady concerned does not have the means to submit the fee. I agree with the Deputy that it would be terrible if she could not get her citizenship because she could not pay the fee. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sees it exactly as the Deputy does.

This is causing much annoyance, anger and antagonism among the citizens of south Kilkenny. If this proposal goes ahead it will mean that Waterford not only gets 6,000 acres from Kilkenny, but also approximately 5,000 people with a projected population of 18,000 in the next ten years because of the infrastructural developments that have taken place there at the behest of Kilkenny County Council. Not only do people feel culturally——

County Kilkenny has not received as many facilities in several years.Approximately 5,000 people do not want to move to a new county or province. The land in question is in County Kilkenny and within the Waterford city environs. The area includes Belview Port and the lands in the area that have been rezoned by Kilkenny County Council. The lands around Belview Port were purchased with the IDA, Waterford Harbour Commissioners and Kilkenny County Council while Waterford City Council decided it did not want to participate at the time. Numerous public meetings in opposition to the Waterford take-over of these lands have been held in Kilkenny, with more than 10,000 signatures opposing the take-over handed into Waterford City Council. I hope the Minister understands the complexities involved in Waterford City Council's proposal as emotions are running high on this issue.Parish boundaries, not to talk of county boundaries, are a major issue in counties like Kilkenny and Waterford. These boundaries are the basis for what happens in rural areas especially in sport and ecclesiastical matters. If this proposal went through, Kilkenny GAA would lose a club and highly valuable property. Slieverue GAA club's pitch and clubhouse would become part of County Waterford. I do not want a situation arising where Eddie O'Connor, Willie O'Connor and Christy Heffernan would hurl for Waterford. Kilkenny GAA has set up a special committee to examine the matter and it is opposed to the proposal. It has been to the forefront, in addition to the confederation of south Kilkenny communities, in gathering signatures and mounting a campaign against this proposal. No one should be forced to abandon their cultural identity. We have learned this over many years. If the Minister allows this proposal to proceed, an atmosphere will be created that will take many generations to overcome.The first step that needs to be taken by Kilkenny County Council is to bestow urban status on the area's largest inhabited area, namely Ferrybank. This would give the area the necessary recognition for it to develop all the services for the area. The next step is the development of the area through the planning, land use and transportation study plan, PLUTTS, following along the lines employed by Cork city in its LUTTS plan. The PLUTTS plan was recently established between Kilkenny County Council and Waterford City and County Councils to draw up a blueprint for the planning and development of Waterford city environs for the next 20 years. It is a co-operative approach to develop infrastructure and services for the most important asset in the area, the people. However, the ink was barely dry on the plan when Waterford City Council decided to make the application for the 6,000 acres. The people of south Kilkenny were not happy at this preliminary strike on the most valued rezoned land around Waterford Port.A co-operative approach rather than a confrontational one is the best resolution to this matter. Kilkenny County Council and its people have always supported Waterford City Council. There were no objections to any plans or proposals Waterford had for the south Kilkenny area, such as the airport, the sewerage facilities for Waterford city and the attempts to upgrade the institute of technology to university status. Kilkenny is determined to ensure this application does not go ahead. The money that will have to be spent on consultants by local authorities and the Department should instead be channelled into better use for the people of Ferrybank and other affected areas. The nonsense must stop and the Minister must terminate the process as the submission date of 26 September has passed. It would be better to get on with the co-operative approach rather than the confrontational in this matter.

What is most interesting is that county boundaries were drawn in 1604 when the last county, Wicklow, was created. We have such a passionate interest in county boundaries. The Deputy was really winning up to the point where he pointed out that Kilkenny might lose some of its star hurlers. As a Wexford man, that tipped the argument for me. I understand the extraordinary passion that exists on this issue. Recently when in Limerick and Clare, I foolishly decided to be on a radio talk-in show to discuss a similar process occurring there. It is not a bad idea for Ministers to listen but in this case it was very much one-way traffic. One lady compared the process to Operation Barbarossa, suggesting bridges would be torn down to prevent this happening. I have a more anodyne response but I have listened to the points made by the Deputy. I agree that co-operative approaches resolve many problems.Under Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 and associated regulations, a local authority may initiate a proposal for the alteration of its boundaries. A formal boundary alteration proposal must identify financial, organisational and other implications. It also involves invitation of public submissions and consultation with the other local authorities affected by the proposal, prior to submitting a formal application to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The initiative in the early stages lies, therefore, within the proposing authority.While no boundary application from Waterford City Council is before the Department, I am aware a proposal for a boundary extension in accordance with Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 was agreed by Waterford City Council in July 2005. The proposal involves the inclusion of an area within the city boundary which is in County Kilkenny. Any subsequent boundary extension application would statutorily come before me and it would be inappropriate, therefore, at this juncture for me to comment on the proposal. 
        However, I can outline the process to the House which will demonstrate that it will not take place for some time.Under the current provisions, Waterford City Council has invited submissions from Kilkenny County Council and from the public. Kilkenny County Council is allowed up to six months to consider the proposal. During this time, Kilkenny County Council may make a formal statement of response adopted by the county council members to the proposal. Any such response would cover the financial, administrative and other implications the county council may wish to raise.Following consideration of the outcome of the public consultation process and KilkennyCounty Council's statement of response, Waterford City Council may decide to submit to me a formal application for a boundary alteration. As I have already stated, it has not yet done so. I am sure its members will read carefully the comments put on the record of this House by Deputy Hogan.In the case of a disagreement, which I suspect exists, between the authorities concerned and before deciding on an application, there is a provision for the establishment of an independent boundary committee to examine all aspects of the proposal. Deputy Hogan knows me well enough to be familiar with my views as to who should make political decisions. However, that is the law. The committee may make such recommendations with respect to the boundary as it considers necessary in the interests of effective and convenient local government. Such a boundary committee must consult the local authorities concerned and where the proposal relates to a county or city boundary, must invite submissions from the public and may conduct an oral hearing if necessary.On receipt of a boundary committee report — this is the position in law — the Minister may prepare a draft order altering the boundary and must have regard to the report in deciding whether to make the order. Significantly for this debate, any draft ministerial order to alter the boundary of any county or city would require a positive resolution by each House of the Oireachtas before coming into force. I can think of one or two other boundary issues that would cause some interesting and fractious debates in the House.Therefore, the statutory process allows ample opportunity to hear and respond to the views of people affected by any proposed boundary alteration. The process is sufficiently robust and responsive to ensure an outcome that takes account of any such views. I note in particular and am inclined to underscore the comments about the necessity for people to sit down together. This should not be limited to discussing boundary change issues like this as other councils have issues where boundaries are contiguous and boundary changes are not proposed. A greater degree of co-operation would better serve the people in such administrations.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	458	In a week in which waste dominated proceedings in this House, it is perhaps ironic that it is the last matter to be discussed. However, I refer to waste of a different order, pertaining to the issue of recycling facilities. This is national recycling week. Rehab and Repak have run advertisements on national and local television and radio stations and people have been induced to bring along their recycling materials by the possibility of winning a car, assuming they live in an area with a recycling facility.There is no recycling facility in the constituency of Kildare North, where I live. Two exist in Kildare South but I live an hour's drive from the closest one. There is one in Kilcullen on a former landfill site and another in Athy, which was purpose built. Its construction was completed almost a year before it opened, because the local authority had neither the staff nor the money to do so. I wish to raise this aspect of recycling.Earlier this year, performance indicators relating to recycling were issued on a range of 41 topics. Kildare County Council fared quite poorly with a figure of 7%, but was by no means the worst. I understand that Galway City Council performed best with a figure of almost 50%. Hence, there is a wide disparity in performance across the country.We must go beyond performance indicators and ask why this is happening. Is it because people are not co-operating or is goodwill lacking? One factor which operates as a disincentive is the manner in which local authorities are funded. I accept that on the west coast, the argument that its infrastructure lags behind is justifiable. However on the east coast, development pressures are bringing their own problems. The Minister is familiar with this because his constituency is similar to mine in that regard.Some local authorities have little discretion. For example, last year Kildare County Council received an increase from the local government fund which looked good on paper. However, all the additional money was taken up by the cost of buying extra water from Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council to cater for the influx of new people to the county, by the additional staff required to operate the augmented waste water treatment plants and for the benchmarking awards. No additional money was available for anything else. The expenditure was necessary, but the example demonstrates how the scope for other activities is lacking.The fund has some weaknesses. It presumes all authorities start from the same base and that there is no progression subsequently. As guarantees were given that no local authority would lose out, the possibility of local authorities which have lagged behind receiving an increase depends on the fund's buoyancy. It does not seriously consider the impact of population increases. There is competition between the provision of traffic calming, disabled persons' grants and recycling facilities. All are needed, but when one is obliged to make choices, it partially explains why recycling has lost out in this respect.Door to door collection appears to be the most successful means of dealing with recycling. However, local bottle banks are being inappropriately used by people leaving domestic waste beside them, which is in part a response to the introduction of the pay-by-weight system. Some bottle banks had to be taken away because of this problem, so we are losing recycling facilities. The door to door approach seems to produce the greatest dividends.The operation of the local government fund is under review at present. I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of building an incentive into it so that issues like recycling are taken into account. I do not see how it can happen otherwise. While a view exists that recycling always saves money, it can be quite expensive to put facilities in place in the first instance. Some incentives should be built into the fund's operation to achieve the kind of return whereby performances around the country become more consistent. Perhaps this time next year, during national recycling week, we might have a better set of figures showing progress in this regard.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I am grateful to Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising the issue. She has made a passionate case for County Kildare and I accept that. I will try to explain how the manner in which recycling is funded is somewhat different to the general fund. This could not be a better week in which to raise the issue of waste management and recycling for many reasons. I disagree that the provision of recycling facilities around the country is patchy. The progress in recycling over the past eight years has been extraordinary. People and communities have embraced it and made a success of it. For example, in 2003, which is the last year for which we have the full audited figures, almost 730,000 tonnes, or 28% of municipal waste was recycled. In 1998, the corresponding figure was 167,000 tonnes, or 9%. By any standard, that is a phenomenal record. The Deputy put her finger on it when she noted that door to door systems played a major role in that success. There are about 83,000 seats in Croke Park and if everyone in the stadium was replaced by a bail of one tonne of waste, Croke Park would be filled nine times over by the waste that has been taken out of the system by recycling. That is an extraordinary change. We have come from almost zero recycling to this in a short period of time.The number of bring banks doubled between 1998 and 2003. I know that there are problems where people abuse the bring bank system and where bring banks are not cleared quickly enough. We now have 1,700 bring centres in operation compared to 835 in 1998. Today there are 64 civic amenity sites compared to 30 in 1998. I accept the point made by the Deputy, however, that there are none in north Kildare.A total of 560,000 households had a separate collection for recyclables by 2003 and this has increased further since then. In 1998 the figure was 70,000 households. We have been particularly successful on packaging waste. In 1998, less than 94,000 tonnes of packaging waste, or 15% of the waste stream, was recycled. In 2003, 420,000 tonnes or 44% of packaging was recycled. All the indications are that we are on track to make the 2005 EU target of 50%. A few years ago this was regarded as unattainable.The environment fund itself marked a significant change in the approach to State funding of waste infrastructure. The fund's income is derived from environmental levies in line with best international practice. Using the fund, a capital grants scheme established in 2002 has provided €50 million to over 90 projects, from bring banks to composting facilities, materials recovery facilities and civic amenity sites.These projects are determined by individual local authorities in the context of their statutory responsibility for waste management planning. They are not determined on the basis of the spend for last year plus a percentage, which is how much of the funding flows to local government and which has a knock-on effect for counties like Kildare, Wicklow, Meath and Louth that surround a large conurbation like Dublin. However, this is not how the funding allocations are made in this instance. They are determined on the basis of the projects coming forward and projects that are needed. Proposals are evaluated by the Department to ensure that they fit well with overall national objectives, including the provision of recycling infrastructure right across the country. Proximity is important. There is no point in driving 40 miles to save the planet, if one is using up hydrocarbons to recycle waste.On the general question of local authority resources, overall current expenditure by local authorities has increased dramatically since 1997. This Government has made extra resources available at an unprecedented level. For instance, between 1999 and 2005 general purpose grants doubled, which is way ahead of inflation. Objectively, there has been a real resource transfer. These grants now fund about one fifth of local authorities' current expenditure. In addition, grants for specific schemes have increased rapidly. The rapid economic growth of recent years, supported by Government policies, has meant increased income for local authorities through growth in the commercial rates base and through goods and services supplied.The allocation of grants by my Department is carried out transparently and in a way that encourages authorities themselves to get value for money. Five year multi-annual capital investment programmes provide a structured basis for local authorities to do their work. The Deputy shares my concern for issues like local authority housing. For the first time ever, local authorities are getting five year capital funding and they are also being mandated to produce their own strategic plans. Any local authority that fails to meet its objectives from now on is failing because of something that is happening at that level and not because of something that is happening at central level.General purpose grants are distributed on the basis of the needs of each local authority, the amount available for distribution and the income available to each authority from local sources. Factors such as population, the extent of the public road network, the cost of water supply, distribution and treatment, as well as the management and maintenance of public housing, are all taken into account in deciding on these allocations. I will encourage my Department to refine its approach, which must move away from the historical approach, whereby councils asked for what was given last year plus a percentage. Distribution must take cognisance of the evolving circumstances. I will work hard to find the funding for any local authority that comes up with a good recycling proposal.There is a passion in Ireland for recycling. People have taken to recycling across all sectors and when we get the statistics for the WEEE directive, which came into effect in August, we will be very surprised as the tonnages of the last two weeks have surpassed all expectations. If the Deputy has concerns about the lack of facilities in her constituency, I will be willing to listen to any proposal from her or from the council.

This is three years earlier than the agreed EU target date of 2015. It places Ireland in the front rank of donors worldwide, in terms of both the quality and the volume of assistance we provide to the world's poorest countries. I am pleased that this decision has received a broad welcome from the development community. It is worth noting that the 2012 timeframe was my stated and public preference at the launch of the White paper consultation process.The increases involved are very significant. They are the largest ever increases made by any Government. On the basis of current anticipated growth rates, spending on ODA would be of the order of €1.5 billion in 2012. From 2005 to 2012 we will spend as much as €8 billion on overseas aid.We have agreed a number of steps along the way to reaching the target. First, we have an interim target of 0.5% of GNP in 2007. The aid budget will reach €773 million in that year. Second, aid spending is expected to reach 0.6% of GNP in 2010. We have, then, a clear pathway to achieving the UN target in 2012.The commitment of this Government to overseas development cannot be doubted. Spending on overseas aid this year, at €545 million, is the highest level in the history of the programme. Ireland's aid budget has tripled since this Government came into office. With this announcement, it will triple again by 2012.In addition to the increased resources, we have ensured that the programme is of the highest quality. The high quality of Ireland's aid programme is recognised by both NGOs and donors. The most recent peer review of the programme by the OECD said that Ireland is "at the cutting edge of international development policy". I am determined that these high standards will be maintained as the programme continues to expand.My view about legislating on the 0.7% target is on record. I am not convinced that legislation is the answer. This would create a precedent which could be invoked for many areas of Government expenditure. Moreover, we have clearly charted the way forward, including interim targets for 2007 and 2010. Our commitment is achievable, and it will emphatically be achieved.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 106 and 159 together.At last November's European Union Military Capabilities Commitment Conference, Ireland indicated that we were prepared to enter into consultations with partners with a view to potential participation in the battlegroups initiative. As reported previously to the House, I have subsequently undertaken consultations with my counterparts from Sweden, Finland and Austria on the role that battlegroups, or rapid response elements as they are also known, can play in enhancing the EU's crisis management capabilities.At the domestic level, an interdepartmental group, which includes representatives of my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Attorney General's office, is currently examining the policy, legislative and operational issues arising from Ireland's possible participation in rapid response elements, or battlegroups. The work of the group is ongoing. A subgroup dealing with legal and legislative issues is to report shortly and I expect that, once the legal issues have been clarified, it will be possible for the group to complete its deliberations on the other issues quite quickly. The group will report, in the first instance, to the Minister for Defence.I hope that the report of the interdepartmental group will enable the Government, in due course, to make a fully informed decision on Ireland's participation in rapid response elements, or battlegroups.I did not discuss Irish participation in EU rapid response elements, or battlegroups, with the United Nations during the recent World Summit, as the discussions in New York focused on the main themes of the summit itself. However, the House will be aware that the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, in his address to the National Forum on Europe during his visit to Ireland in November 2004, welcomed the development of the battlegroups concept. He noted the important role that regional organisations such as the EU can play in supporting the UN in crisis management and peacekeeping operations. Earlier this year, the Secretary General emphasised this point again in his major report on UN reform entitled "In Larger Freedom". In this report, he called on the international community to support the efforts by the European Union, the African Union and others to establish standby capacities as part of an interlocking system of peacekeeping capacities.The outcome document of the World Summit includes a paragraph recognising the important contribution to peace and security by regional organisations. It is significant that this paragraph contains an endorsement of the efforts of the EU in this regard, as follows: "We support the efforts of the European Union and other regional entities to develop capacities such as for rapid deployment, standby and bridging arrangements"— Para 93 (b).The outcome document forms part of the context in which the Government will consider possible Irish participation in EU battlegroups. As the Deputy will also be aware, any Irish participation in an actual operation would remain a sovereign national decision, subject to the usual triple lock requirements of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation.

In advance of the Council, I appeared before the Joint Committee on European Affairs on Wednesday, 28 September to review the agenda. Following the Council, my Department forwarded the relevant Council conclusions prepared by the secretariat to the joint committee for information.The focus of the general affairs agenda was EU enlargement, with Council approving a framework for negotiations with Turkey on its accession to the EU, as mandated by the European Council last December. A ministerial meeting to open the negotiations took place immediately following the Council meeting.Ministers also approved the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia, on the basis of a positive assessment of Croatia's co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY. These negotiations were also formally opened following the conclusion of the Council meeting.I welcome the agreement to open accession talks with both of these countries. In making its historic decision, the EU has kept faith with the commitments made to Turkey at the December 2004 European Council, and those made to Croatia last March. The accession negotiations that now follow may be protracted and difficult. If progress is to be made, it will be essential that both Turkey and Croatia deliver fully on the commitments which they in turn have made to the EU.In a lunchtime discussion, the Presidency outlined its plans for the informal meeting of Heads of Government in London on 26-27 October next. The subjects for informal exchanges will include: achieving social justice and competitiveness in the face of globalisation and changing demographics; how Europe can strengthen its international role; and how it can provide security against cross-border threats.Under the external relations agenda, the Council adopted conclusions in relation to Uzbekistan, Iran, the Middle East peace process, the western Balkans, Colombia, EU support for international peace and security, an international treaty on the arms trade, and preparations for the EU-Russia Summit.The Council decided to impose a series of measures including an embargo on exports to Uzbekistan of arms, military equipment and other equipment that might be used for internal repression and restrictions on admission to the European Union aimed at those individuals directly responsible for the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force in Andijan on 11 May. I strongly support these steps, which have been taken against the background of the Uzbek authorities' refusal to allow an independent international inquiry into the events which took place in Andijan on that day.The Council welcomed the resolution adopted by the IAEA board of governors on 4 September and urged Iran to implement all the measures requested by the IAEA board, including reinstating a full suspension of all fuel cycle activities. I hope that Iran will heed the calls by the IAEA and use the breathing space offered to implement all of the necessary measures called for by the IAEA board. We must continue to do all we can on our part to maximise the chances of constructive re-engagement and of a diplomatic solution to this issue.Ministers agreed to authorise the Commission to open negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro for an association and stabilisation agreement. This marks the first important step towards the establishment of contractual relations between the EU and Serbia and Montenegro.Finally, I suggested to colleagues that it would make sense for the EU to review the action which it had taken in response to the Indian Ocean tsunami, in view of the anniversary which falls on 26 December. The suggestion was supported and the UK Presidency asked the Commission and Council secretariat to prepare a report for circulation to member states in December.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	463	At their sixth formal meeting in Naples on 2-3 December 2003, the Foreign Ministers of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, also referred to as the Barcelona process, formally agreed to the establishment of the Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue between Cultures. This foundation is designed to promote cultural, educational and people to people exchanges between the countries of the European Union and the partner countries of the Mediterranean basin. Ireland was among the first of the Euro-Med partners to pledge support for the foundation, with a contribution of €100,000. This pledge was made as a demonstration of our commitment to, and interest in, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.During our EU Presidency, Ireland strove to secure the necessary agreement for the launch of the foundation. It was agreed at the mid-term Euro-Med Foreign Ministers meeting, held in Dublin on 5-6 May 2004, to locate the foundation in Alexandria in Egypt, where it will be housed jointly in the Alexandria Library and the Swedish Institute.Ireland's special ambassador for the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership during our EU Presidency, Ambassador John Campbell, assisted in the selection of the executive director of the EuroMed Foundation, Dr. Traugott Schoefter of Germany. More recently, the statutes of the foundation have been agreed between all partners and it was formally launched at a ceremony in Alexandria on 20 April 2005.It is intended that the foundation will have links to national networks in each of the partner countries. My Department is now consulting a number of academic institutions with the aim of securing agreement on a national co-ordinator for the foundation and hopes that a decision will be taken shortly.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 97, 158, 161 and 165 together.The position is that 13 member states have ratified the European constitution to date, two by referendum and 11 by parliamentary procedure. Parliamentary ratification procedures are far-advanced in one other member state. The constitution has been rejected by referendum in two member states. The Government very much regretted the referendum results in France and the Netherlands, while respecting the decisions of the people of those countries, just as we respect the decisions of those who have already ratified the constitution.It is now accepted that the European constitution will not enter into force by the target date of 1 November 2006. Beyond this, the implications of the no votes in France and the Netherlands remain unclear. Following the referendum results, the June European Council decided to initiate a period of reflection with regard to the European constitution. The intention is that member states should avail of this opportunity to hold national debates on European issues, including the European constitution. Next week, as part of this process, the Government will publish the White Paper on the European Constitution which gives a factual description of the constitution and Ireland's approach to its negotiation. The White Paper will help raise public awareness of the constitution and the issues it addresses.The Heads of State and the Government will review the position with regard to the European Constitution during the Austrian Presidency in 2006. We need to let this process take its course. President Barroso has suggested that the constitution will not enter into force for the next two or three years. This reflects a widely-held view of the constitution's ratification prospects. President Barroso's main point, however, was that the EU should give priority to dealing with such pressing issues as job creation, security, and protecting the environment. I agree that success in tackling these problems will reinforce the EU's credibility with the European public. The Government remains committed to the European constitution because we believe it to be good for Europe and good for Ireland. The constitution is the product of a debate which was unprecedented in its openness and scope, first at the European convention and then at the intergovernmental conference. It represents a carefully balanced compromise between the member states. We continue to look forward to the constitution's ratification and entry into force. Until the position is clarified at the European level, it is not intended to set a date for a referendum in Ireland. A similar approach has been adopted in those other member states which intend to ratify the constitution by referendum. As no date will be set in the short-term, the issue of the establishment of the Referendum Commission does not arise at this time.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The European Council last met on 16 and 17 June of this year and the Taoiseach reported to the House in detail on 21 June on the meeting's outcome with regard to the European Union's financial framework for the period 2007-13.I would recall briefly that the June European Council failed to reach agreement on the future financial perspectives. While the great majority of member states could accept the Luxembourg Presidency's final compromise package of 17 June, a small number of countries remained opposed for a variety of reasons, including the UK's budgetary rebate, the level of net contributions and funding for cohesion.The Taoiseach indicated at the European Council that, in the interests of solidarity, Ireland could accept the Luxembourg Presidency's final proposal. Throughout the negotiations, Ireland's fundamental objective has been to ensure that the enlarged Union is equipped with the necessary financial resources to enable it to meet the challenges of the years ahead and the rightful expectations of our citizens. We had particular priorities in these negotiations. These were to safeguard the October 2002 agreement on the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, ensure adequate cohesion arrangements for our regions in transition, put in place equitable financing arrangements for the Union, secure continued EU support for the peace process and to achieve increased funding for competitiveness, especially in the area of research and development.As we enter into the next phase of negotiations under the UK Presidency, I want to assure the Deputy and the House that Ireland's priorities are unchanged. In bilateral consultations with the Presidency, we have insisted that the basis for agreement in December must be the package that was on the table in June. My understanding is that this is also the position of a clear majority of member states.As part of Ireland's ongoing engagement in these negotiations, we have availed of our bilateral contacts with EU partners, both at ministerial and official level, in order to ensure a full understanding of, and support for, our position. In addition, Ireland's participation as an observer in a friends of cohesion group is intended, and is seen by members of this group, particularly the ten new member states, as evidence of our commitment to solidarity with the poorer regions of the Union. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, will travel to Budapest for the group's next meeting tomorrow.At the Foreign Ministers' meeting I attended this week in Luxembourg, the Presidency informed us of its intention to circulate new proposals in November with the aim of securing political agreement at the European Council on 15-16 December. For our part, we will do everything possible, consistent with our stated priorities, to secure early agreement in the interests of the enlarged Union and its citizens. I will keep the House updated on the progress of these vital negotiations.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	466	The EU-Russia Summit which took place in London on 4 October reviewed progress in implementation of what are known as the four "Common Spaces", which relate to economic issues, freedom, security and justice, external security and research and education. By focusing summit preparations on a small number of specific areas and pressing these strongly, the Union was able to achieve some good results.On the eve of the summit, a first permanent partnership council involving Energy Ministers on both sides was held. In view of Russia's growing role in assuring security of energy supplies to the EU, the raising of the energy dialogue to ministerial level is a significant development. Issues in this energy dialogue include energy efficiency, trade, investment and infrastructure, as well as climate change and co-operation in respect of the Kyoto Protocol which Russia ratified last year.The summit welcomed two linked agreements between the EU and Russia on visa facilitation and readmission. Russia's agreement to take back Russian nationals illegally in the EU, under conditions set out in the readmission agreement, breaks new ground. Despite some limitations, these agreements significantly advance the common space on freedom, security and justice between the EU and Russia and constitute a real achievement. As a non-Schengen country, Ireland is not covered by either agreement but would intend to negotiate bilateral agreements with Russia on the matters they cover.A €20 million programme of EU assistance for socio-economic recovery in the north Caucasus was also announced at the summit. Pursuant to the commitment to work together in the regions adjacent to the EU and to Russia in building the common space of external security, the summit discussed a number of regional issues including Moldova, Belarus and Uzbekistan. While full agreement between the EU and Russia on these issues is not to be expected, consultation is important in building mutual trust.President Putin raised the question of institutional arrangements to follow the EU-Russia Partnership and Co-operation Agreement which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2007. Internal EU discussion on this subject will be stepped up in the period ahead.

In my reply of 8 March 2005, I said that Senator Edward Kennedy, joined by Senators John Kerry and Charles Schumer, had written to President Bush to urge a reversal of the decision by the US Department of Homeland Security to terminate the "temporary protected status" granted to 292 refugees from Montserrat allowing them to reside in the US. This status was granted following the major volcanic eruption in 1997 which destroyed much of the island of Montserrat, and its revocation came into effect on 27 February 2005. Senator Schumer had also sponsored a Senate bill to provide relief for the Montserrat group, and a similar measure has been introduced in the House of Representatives.The last action in respect of the Bill in the Senate was a referral to the Committee on the Judiciary on 7 February 2005, while the last action in the House of Representatives was a referral to the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims on 2 March 2005.I understand that no concerted action has been taken to deport the Montserratians and, in the meantime, efforts to secure a deferral of any enforced departures amongst the Montserrat group continue to be made by its friends in the US Congress. Any decision on this matter is a matter for the US authorities but, as I have previously said, we very much appreciate the humanitarian impulse underlying the initiative taken in this case by Senator Kennedy and his colleagues.

This is particularly the case as regards the permanent seats on the council, which are still occupied by the five major victorious powers in the Second World War, who hold the power of veto over its decisions.The question of reform of the Security Council has been under discussion in the UN General Assembly since 1993, but agreement has failed to emerge.In the course of these discussions, Ireland and a number of like-minded partners supported a regionally balanced increase in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of member. We supported the abolition of the veto, but opposed in any event its extension to new permanent members. We have also been firm in our view that any reform of the Security Council should not result in any diminution of the opportunity for small and medium-sized countries to serve regularly on the Security Council.A high level panel was established by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, in 2003 to examine how current threats and challenges might be best addressed by the international community. He asked it to address, among other things, the question of reform of the Security Council. The panel, which reported in December 2004, failed to agree on any one model of reform, offering instead two different models. One model would establish six new permanent and three new non-permanent seats, while the other would provide for no new permanent seats but would create a new category of eight seats to which states could be elected, and re-elected, for four years, along with one new normal non-permanent seat.In his own recommendations to the UN Summit, Secretary General Annan said that while reform of the Security Council was a matter for the UN member states rather than for himself, he believed that that "no reform of the United Nations would be complete without reform of the Security Council". He did not express a view on either of the models put forward by the high level panel, urging UN members to consider both models as well as "any other viable options".In May of this year a group of four countries, Germany, Japan, India and Brazil, which base their claim to permanent membership on their strong contributions to the UN system, circulated a draft framework resolution on Security Council reform. This draft provides for six new permanent members, including two from the African continent, along with four additional non-permanent members. A provision that would extend the veto to the new permanent members was later removed, in favour of a review in 2020. A vote on this draft resolution was delayed pending the conclusion of negotiations with other members of the General Assembly, and particularly with the members of African Union, whose votes were regarded as crucial to securing the two-thirds majority necessary for adoption. These negotiations were not concluded in advance of the recent UN Summit. It remains to be seen whether the group of four will put forward their draft resolution again in the new session of the General Assembly.Some members of the General Assembly do not regard it as sufficient to adopt a reform of the Security Council by means of the two-thirds majority required under the UN Charter. They maintain that the legitimacy of, and universal respect for, any reform measure requires a much broader degree of consensus. They put forward a rival draft resolution based on the second model proposed by the high level panel but did not submit it to a vote in the General Assembly. Our European Union partners include strong supporters of both approaches, which has prevented the emergence of a common EU position.At the recent UN 2005 World Summit, world leaders reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. They also unanimously supported early reform of the Security Council and asked the General Assembly to review progress by the end of this year. In my own address to the General Assembly on 19 September, I drew attention to the wide acknowledgement of the need to align the Security Council with today's realities, and aid that this remained an important piece of unfinished business.

However, little progress has been made in talks between the parties since then. Following the tsunami in December 2004, which particularly affected Tamil regions in the north and east of Sri Lanka, renewed efforts were made to resume negotiations to settle the conflict. Despite the absence of progress in the negotiations and escalating violence, both sides continue to reaffirm their commitment to the peace process.The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, met with a delegation from the LTTE on 14 April last and expressed Ireland's dissatisfaction with the slow pace of progress in the peace process. The Minister of State also discussed Irish humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka, including to the Tamil regions, and urged the LTTE to cooperate with the Government of Sri Lanka in the reconstruction of affected areas.Despite improved co-operation in areas affected by the tsunami, the incidence of violence in recent months has increased. On 12 August, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar was murdered. At the time I issued a statement condemning this appalling act. I had met Minister Kadirgamar last January when I visited Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster. Mr. Kadirgamar, a Tamil, is believed by the SriLankan Government to have been assassinated by the LTTE. The Taoiseach wrote to the President of Sri Lanka conveying the condolences of the Government and the people of Ireland on the assassination.Following the murder of Mr. Kadirgamar and other recent outbreaks of violence, the Norwegian Government sought, at the request of the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE, to convene a meeting between them. Agreement could not be reached on a location for the meeting as the LTTE did not accept the venue proposed byNorway and it was decided to postpone attempts to bring the two sides together until immediately after the forthcoming Presidential elections due to be held on 17 November. In the meantime, the Norwegian Government has sent retired Major General Trond Furuhovde, former Head of Mission of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, to Sri Lanka as its Special Representative. Major General Furuhovde will consult with both parties on the security situation and underline the importance of respect for the ceasefire agreement.On 19 September the co-chairs of the Tokyo donor conference, the EU, US, Norway and Japan, following a meeting in New York at Norway's request to discuss the situation following the assassination of Foreign Minister Kadirgamar, called on the LTTE to take immediate public steps to demonstrate their commitment to the peace process and their willingness to change. They also called on the LTTE to end political assassinations and the recruitment of child soldiers.The European Union issued a statement on 26 September condemning the continued use of violence and terrorism by the LTTE. The statement said that the pursuit of political goals by such totally unacceptable methods only served to damage the LTTE's standing and credibility as a negotiating partner and gravely endangered the peace process so much desired by the people of Sri Lanka. The EU is actively considering the formal listing of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation and in the meantime has agreed that delegations from the LTTE will no longer be received in any of the EU member states until further notice. I hope that following the presidential elections renewed efforts will be made by all sides to work towards a lasting peace.

This was a major achievement for the Government from which I derive considerable satisfaction.The decision represents a significant advance for the Irish language. Irish becomes the 21st official and working language of the Union. It will mean that important European Union legislation will be translated into Irish and that Irish can be used in the European Parliament and at meetings of the Council.The new status of Irish within the EU will take effect on 1 January 2007. In the meantime, the EU institutions will put in place the necessary staff and budgetary resources to give effect to this new policy. The Government will co-operate closely with the institutions in this regard.Táimse féin thar a bheith sásta le cinneadh seo an Chomhairle, agus tá súil agam go gcuideoidh an staideas nua le forbairt na teangan.

Under the Irish Presidency, the June 2004 European Council agreed that Croatia fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria and the specific conditions established for the countries of the western Balkans. The European Council decided that Croatia was a candidate country for membership, and that accession negotiations should open early in 2005. This decision was confirmed by the December 2004 European Council, which decided that negotiations should open on 17 March 2005, provided there was full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY.When the General Affairs and External Relations Council met in Brussels in March, it was clear that it would not be possible to achieve the unanimous decision of member states required for the opening of accession negotiations. Given concerns on the extent of Croatia's co-operation with the ICTY, the Council postponed the opening of accession negotiations until it was established that Croatia was indeed co-operating fully. At the same time, the Council reaffirmed the commitment of the EU to Croatia's membership, and adopted the necessary negotiating framework.Meeting in Luxembourg earlier this week, the Council welcomed the report to the Croatia task force by the ICTY chief prosecutor that the country was now co-operating fully with the ICTY, as well as the clear commitment by the Croatian Prime Minister that full co-operation would be maintained until the last remaining indictee was in The Hague, and as long as required by the ICTY. The Council concluded that Croatia had met the outstanding condition for the start of accession negotiations and that negotiations should begin as soon as possible, which they did directly thereafter. The Council also confirmed that sustaining full co-operation with the ICTY would remain a requirement for progress throughout the accession process.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	472	Ethiopia's third general election, held on 15 May 2005, was the most genuinely competitive in the country's history. International observers were present, including an EU election observation mission, EOM, with Irish participation. The organisation and execution of the ballot exceeded the expectations of most election observers, although some shortcomings were identified. Irish observers of the voting process, including Deputy Charlie O'Connor, Senator Fergal Browne and Mrs. Mary Banotti, reported positively on both its transparency and completeness.However, the post-election period was marred by the slowness of the counting process, a ban on public demonstrations in Addis Ababa and complaints of irregularities by both the opposition and the governing Ethiopian People's Democratic Front, EPRDF, party. This led to increased tensions in Addis Ababa and serious violence on 8 June 2005, in which up to 40 people were killed. Over 4,000 people were detained at that time, all but 58 of whom were later released.In response to some 380 complaints of irregularities, the National Election Board of Ethiopia, NEBE, and the main political parties also agreed a complaints investigations process. This review took over two months and led to election re-runs in 31 constituencies, all of which were won by the governing EPRDF. Both the EOM and the Carter Centre have said that the complaints investigation process did not provide an effective remedy.The official results announced by the NEBE on 5 September 2005 declared the governing EPRDF the winner, with 327 out of 546 seats filled. Parties affiliated to the EPRDF won a further 45 seats. Opposition parties and an independent candidate won a total of 174 seats, a major increase on the 19 seats which they held in the last parliament.The final report and recommendations of the EOM are due to be issued in the coming days. In its interim statements, it commended the open and competitive nature of pre-election campaigning, while drawing attention to some deficiencies and irregularities.The main opposition parties rejected the results of the election as flawed and alleged that intimidation and human rights abuses of their leaders and supporters were continuing. Initially, they threatened to boycott the new Parliament, which is due to convene on 10 October 2005, and planned to hold major demonstrations in Addis Ababa and other urban centres on 2 October 2005. When these demonstrations were not authorised, they called instead for three days of general strike and peaceful disobedience, beginning on 3 October 2005. The Ethiopian Government indicated that it would not hold any dialogue with opposition parties unless they accepted the official election results and pursued disputes through the courts.This difficult political impasse was broken following an intervention by representatives of the EU Troika, the US and the United Nations with both Government and opposition on 1 October 2005. The opposition parties signed a statement committing themselves to constitutional, peaceful and legal mechanisms to resolve political conflict and seeking talks with the Government. In return, the Prime Minister gave a commitment to engage immediately in dialogue with the opposition if the protests planned for 3 October were called off and the opposition undertook to pursue its objectives via parliamentary means. The Government would also expedite the release of an estimated 1,000 people detained in recent days. Following opposition agreement to these terms, a preliminary round of talks between the Government and opposition took place on 2 October. Further talks were held on 4 October 2005.I welcome these recent positive developments, which are the latest in a series of active efforts by the EU and the international community to help Ethiopia resolve the current political crisis. The EU condemned the violence which occurred on 8 June, called for an independent investigation into the deaths and urged the Ethiopian Government to exercise the utmost restraint and to act in accordance with the principles of international law and respect for human rights. It has also urged the Government and opposition parties to implement faithfully their joint agreement on the elections complaints procedure and their common commitment to non-violence.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	473	My Department continues to monitor closely all developments in relation to the McCartney case. I was shocked to hear the recent reports of continuing intimidation and attacks on members and supporters of the McCartney family. I would like to take this opportunity to repeat my condemnation of this type of intimidation, which is totally unacceptable.Officials of my Department are in ongoing contact with members of the McCartney family, including in relation to the pickets the Deputy mentioned and we have followed up on matters they have raised with us in that regard. I understand that the PSNI is pursuing lines of inquiry in relation to the intimidation and I urge anyone who has information to share it with the police.I should add that the Government's engagement with this issue goes beyond my own Department. The Taoiseach has met with the family on a number of occasions, most recently on 11 July last, and is very active in raising it with appropriate contacts. We discussed the case in our most recent meeting with the Sinn Féin leadership, and signalled that the Government still has real concerns about the situation on the ground, including the ongoing intimidation of the McCartney family, which must be brought to an end.With regard to the progress in the murder investigation itself, as the Deputy is aware, two men have been charged in relation to the attacks on Mr. McCartney and Mr. Devine and are now on bail as the preparation of files continues by the PSNI. As the Deputy will also be aware, two further arrests were made on 4 October as part of the ongoing investigation. Naturally, our main concern at this stage is that justice will prevail and that all of those responsible for Mr. McCartney's murder, and the other related offences, will be brought to account for their actions in a court of law.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 42 together.Following the signing of the accession treaty in April 2005, Bulgaria and Romania participate in almost all EU meetings as active observers. Both countries ratified the accession treaty in May 2005 and are scheduled to join the Union in January 2007, if they are ready.In accordance with the December 2004 European Council conclusions, the Union continues to monitor the progress of Bulgaria and Romania towards meeting the obligations of membership. We look forward to the publication by the Commission of its annual monitoring report on 25 October 2005, which will provide a comprehensive assessment as part of this ongoing process.We believe it is essential that both Bulgaria and Romania make full use of the period between now and their accession to ensure full implementation of their commitments so that they can join the Union, as envisaged, in 2007. This is in the best interests of the Union and of the acceding countries themselves. To this end, Ireland continues to provide assistance and advice to Bulgaria and Romania as part of the bilateral assistance programme of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is designed to help new and acceding member states prepare for the challenges of EU membership.

Current statistics from the United Nations joint programme on AIDS, UNAIDS, indicate that in 2004 almost 40 million people were living with the HIV virus. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the worst affected region and is now home to more than 25 million adults and children living with HIV. Approximately 3 million new infections occurred there in 2004, the majority in women, and more than 2 million Africans died in that year.Ireland has a strong commitment to addressing HIV-AIDS. It is a key priority for Development Co-operation Ireland's policies andprogrammes. We were one of the first donors to develop a HIV-AIDS strategy which has served us well in guiding our response to this crisis. We have continually worked to ensure the issue is high on the agenda of EU and UN funds and programmes. Our financial allocation to the fight against AIDS now constitutes 10% of our total overseas development budget. Expenditure this year is expected to reach €50 million.These resources are directed at a number of HIV-AIDS activities at global, regional, national and community levels and are implemented through international and regional organisations and in our programme countries. The latter include six highly affected countries in southern and eastern Africa. Ireland has and will continue to advocate for a strong response to HIV-AIDS through representation on the executive boards of UN agencies such as UNDP and UNICEF. In addition, we will continue to provide funding to UNAIDS, which is the main advocate for global action on the epidemic.UNAIDS brings together the efforts and resources of ten UN system organisations to help prevent new HIV infections to provide care for those already infected and to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. It is widely recognised that UNAIDS is providing global leadership and is an example of UN reform in action. We are in the process of finalising a multiannual partnership agreement with UNAIDS which will see an increase in the level of resources allocated to it.Ireland has been a strong advocate of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, GFATM, since it was established in 2001. As a partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector and affected communities, the global fund represents a new approach to international health financing. With more than $5.9 billion pledged through to 2008, the fund is a major contributor to the overall increase in resources to fight AIDS, TB and malaria.The first replenishment conference of the GFATM was held in September last. Ireland was one of a few donor countries to announce a 50% increase in its funding to the fund. This commitment will bring our contribution to the fund to a total of €30 million in 2006 and 2007. We will continue to use our membership of the board of the GFATM to contribute to strategic policy orientation and ensure that experience from recipient countries feeds into policy dialogue.The high level meeting to review the millennium development goals, MDGs, in September renewed international focus on tackling major diseases as priorities for development. The review acknowledged that the world has made significant progress in achieving many of the goals but that this progress has been far from uniform. Progress was noted in the increasing access to HIV treatment, particularly in developing countries, from a low 400,000 people on treatment in 2003 to more than 1 million people on HIV treatment today. However, this falls far short of the World Health Organisation's target to reach 3 million by the end of this year. Considerable additional effort is therefore required.At the high level meeting, the Taoiseach reaffirmed Ireland's focus on HIV prevention as the mainstay of our overall response to HIV-AIDS. In his address, the Taoiseach announced a doubling of funding to tackle the major diseases affecting developing countries including HIV-AIDS. We will continue to work with the international community in advocating a sustained and resourced global response to HIV-AIDS, strengthened leadership at all levels, and improved coordination of resources and planning for HIV-AIDS prevention and control.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, came into force in 1970. The treaty has been reviewed at five-year intervals to assess progress under its three pillars of disarmament, non-proliferation, and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.The seventh NPT review conference took place on 2 to 27 May 2005 at the United Nations in New York. In my statement during the general debate, which can be found on my Department's website, I recalled Ireland's close association with the treaty, which was negotiated following an initiative in 1958 taken by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken. I re-affirmed the importance the Government attaches to a rules-based international order and strong international institutions. I emphasised that, for Ireland, upholding the integrity of the treaty means respect for all its provisions, but noted the particular importance attached by Ireland to fulfilment of the nuclear disarmament obligations set out in Article VI and reaffirmed and developed at previous NPT review conferences.The review conference regrettably ended without agreement on substantive conclusions and recommendations on how to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. This was a missed opportunity for the international community to tackle some key threats to global peace and security and to agree an effective collective response. We continue to believe that global challenges are best tackled together, through such a response. That is why efforts to strengthen the treaty and ensure full respect for all its provisions remain our highest priority in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation.Last month, at the summit meeting in New York, the international community again failed to bridge what the United Nations Secretary General has called "the deep rifts over how to confront the challenges we face" in regard to these issues. The agreement reached by Heads of State and Government on a programme of UN reform has many important and positive elements. As the Taoiseach and I both made clear in our addresses to the General Assembly at that time, however, it is deeply disappointing that the agreement contains nothing on disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or on the need to strengthen the NPT.We cannot permit these setbacks to give rise to discouragement or despair. The challenges of which the Secretary General has spoken will not vanish by simply being ignored. I am firmly of the view that the NPT is now more than ever of tremendous importance to the achievement of international peace and security and Ireland will continue to work with like-minded partners to promote progress under it. Moreover, it is essential that all parties to the NPT behave in a manner which is fully and demonstrably in accordance with all its provisions, and this is the objective of the European Union in the approach it has taken in regard to Iran.

In all of our contacts with US political leaders, including when the Taoiseach and I met with President Bush in March, we emphasise the importance of addressing the situation in a positive and sympathetic way. In doing so, we appreciate that immigration is a highly sensitive and divisive issue in the United States, in particular since the tragic events of 11 September 2001.In line with this approach, the Government warmly welcomed the very significant and positive contribution made to the debate on immigration with the introduction last May of the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act by Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain, and by Members of the House of Representatives. Its provisions, if passed into law, would significantly improve the situation of the undocumented Irish in the United States. The Government strongly endorses this bill, and the embassy in Washington is actively seeking support for it on Capitol Hill.In order to most clearly and effectively reflect the concern shared by members of the Oireachtas on this issue, I also proposed today's debate and all-party motion of support for the Kennedy-McCain Bill. My proposal followed from helpful and positive meetings which an Oireachtas delegation led by the Ceann Comhairle had on Capitol Hill recently, including with Senator McCain.The current situation with the Kennedy-McCain Bill is that it had its first reading in the Senate and was then referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. A preliminary committee hearing of the Kennedy-McCain Bill, and of also another immigration Bill known as the Kyl-Cornyn Bill, took place on 26 July. We understand that a further committee hearing is likely to take place soon.In addition to my commitment to advance the interests of the undocumented through legislative reform, I recently announced grants to Irish immigration centres in the US totalling US$915,000. This represented an increase of 40% on last year. I would suggest that any Irish person in need of guidance at this complex time of change should approach one of these centres. They provide a range of invaluable information and advisory services to our community across the US. We are warmly appreciative of their effective and caring support for the more vulnerable members of our community. I myself met recently in New York with representatives of the centres from various parts of the US and heard at first hand of their concerns and priorities. They also expressed deep appreciation of the substantially increased funding of their activities by the Government.

This process included additional representatives of the Sunni community, who were co-opted onto the constitutional committee to compensate for their under-representation in the Assembly. The draft constitution was approved by the committee at the end of August, and will be put to the Iraqi people in a referendum on 15 October.The UN has reported that preparations for the referendum, which are being overseen by the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, are now largely complete. The Deputy will be aware of the concerns which were expressed by the UN following the adoption by the Transitional National Assembly, on 2 October, of a resolution regarding the referendum law. I welcome the decision by the assembly yesterday to withdraw the resolution. While the constitutional referendum is a sovereign Iraqi process, it is important for its credibility that it is based on an electoral framework which meets international standards.I am also aware of the concerns expressed by the International Crisis Group and others on the draft constitution itself. Clearly, complete consensus among the negotiators would have been desirable, and this was not achieved. It has been widely reported that in the final negotiations an overall compromise between Shia, Sunni and Kurdish priorities proved impossible, and that the draft constitution represents, on some points, the majority view of the Shia and Kurdish representatives. Shia and Kurdish leaders have asserted that they agreed to numerous amendments to reflect Sunni concerns. On some points, however, it appears that the basic vision of the Sunni parties was incompatible with that of the Shia and Kurdish communities, which make up some three-quarters of Iraq's population. These, however, are issues for the Iraqi people and their representatives to decide, as part of the democratic process.A central priority of the political process in Iraq is to create the conditions in which the current campaign of lethal violence can be brought to an end. Disagreements on communal lines over the draft constitution should not be allowed to exacerbate that violence. There have been reports that some Sunni parties may be ready to accept the draft constitution in return for some specified concessions, possibly in the form of agreed amendments. I would hope that all avenues capable of achieving greater consensus would continue to be explored by all concerned.Finally, it is my hope that all Iraqi citizens will be able to engage fully in the political debate and to exercise their democratic rights in the referendum on 15 October.

This will involve the relocation to Limerick of 123 posts and is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007. The Office of Public Works is currently assessing a number of accommodation proposals in Limerick.The following table sets out details by grade of the applications for posts in Limerick received through the central applications facility, CAF, from staff serving in the directorate, from those serving elsewhere within the Department and from officers of other Departments and offices.I am aware of the concern expressed by the advisory board for Development Co-operation Ireland about the decentralisation of the directorate to Limerick. Every effort will be made to ensure that the transfer of the directorate to its new location will be as smooth as possible.A detailed implementation plan has been completed by departmental officials, addressing areas such as risk management, business continuity, human resources, training, knowledge management, premises and information and communications technology facilities. The plan, together with regular updates can be accessed on the Department's website. Already, a total of 26, 21%, posts in the directorate are filled by staff who have expressed an interest in decentralising to Limerick, including seven officers recruited from other Departments via the central applications facility, CAF, and five staff recruited from interdepartmental promotion panels. The process of transferring to the directorate, staff currently serving elsewhere in the Department and of recruiting staff via the central applications facility, will be accelerated in the new year. The aim is that by the second half of 2006 most posts in the directorate will be filled by staff who will decentralise to Limerick.

When the full scale of the disaster became evident, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and I jointly announced that our funding would rise to €10 million. This pledge was doubled to €20 million when my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, visited the region with personnel from Concern, Goal, the Irish Red Cross and Trócaire in January. The additional funding was designed to address the longer-term recovery and reconstruction challenges.Within a few months of the tsunami tragedy, over 90% of our pledge had been allocated to relief and recovery efforts. I believe that this achievement can be matched by very few donors and demonstrates the speed and flexibility of our response.Assistance has been made available to non-governmental organisations, NGOs, UN agencies and the Red Cross. The programmes are in line with the national strategies for recovery that have been developed by the Governments of the affected countries. We have also assisted the Thailand tsunami victim identification process. A list of organisations and programmes supported by official Irish assistance is attached for information.A special envoy was appointed for the tsunami-affected region with a mandate to report on the effectiveness of the aid effort. The envoy, former Minister of State and current chairman of the Advisory Board for Development Co-operation Ireland, Mr. Chris Flood, has made three visits to the region over a six-month period. During his visits, the envoy met with a wide range of organisations and individuals, including disaster-affected communities, NGOs, UN agencies and senior Government representatives. The envoy made his final trip to the region in July. His overall report is being prepared at the moment.The process of recovery for such an extensively devastated area will take several years. Crucially, the international humanitarian community recognises that a key feature of that recovery process is that the affected communities will need to be more resistant to and better prepared for, any future crises. Ireland, through its overseas humanitarian and recovery programmes, remains closely engaged with ongoing developments in relation to the recovery process. We are in constant liaison with all stakeholders including our partners in the NGOs, UN and international agencies and are actively monitoring those programmes and initiatives that have been supported with Government funding. This engagement will be actively maintained, including through monitoring visits to the region.CountryAgencyDescriptionAmount approved$BurmaInternational Committee of the Red CrossEmergency Assistance500,000Total Burma500,000IndiaChristian AidEmergency Humanitarian/Basic Needs Assistance250,000IndiaConcern WorldwideEmergency Relief for Tamil Nadu & Pondicherry435,993IndiaGoalEmergency Relief for Tsunami affected populations of Tamil Nadu485,000IndiaOxfam IrelandNon-Food Items for Tsunami Victims250,000IndiaGortaEmergency Relief Programme100,000IndiaHope FoundationTsunami Disaster Relief200,000Total India1,720,993IndonesiaChristian Childrens FundCare & Protection of Children in IDP Camps165,500IndonesiaOxfam IrelandNon food items for Earthquake affected populations in Aceh250,000IndonesiaTrócaireTsunami Emergency Relief300,000IndonesiaMercy CorpsMidwives Livelihoods Recovery Programme278,784IndonesiaConcern WorldwideIntegrated recovery1,979,000IndonesiaTrócaireIntegrated recovery750,000IndonesiaMercy CorpsLivelihoods recovery350,000IndonesiaUNDPCapacity Buidling for Reconstruction1,000,000IndonesiaILOWomen’s livelihood250,000IndonesiaIDLOLegal Aid programme150,000IndonesiaWorld Bank MDTFTrust Fund1,000,000Total Indonesia6,473,284South Asia RegionInternational Organisation for MigrationHealth Care Assistance100,000South Asia RegionOCHA*Immediate Relief Assistance1,000,000South Asia RegionUN High Commission for RefugeesProgrammes in Indonesia & Sri Lanka as per 2005 UN Flash Appeal500,000South Asia RegionUNICEFBasic Needs & Caring/Protecting Children Separated from their families1,000,000South Asia RegionWorld Food Programme (WFP)Food Assistance2,000,000South Asia RegionWorld Health Programme (WHO)Health Care Assistance500,000South Asia RegionUNESCOEarly Warning500,000Total Aouth Asia Region5,600,000Sri LankaGoalEmergency Humanitarian Assistance for IDPs400,000Sri LankaInternational Federation of the Red CrossBay of Bengal: Earthquake & Tsunami Appeal750,000Sri LankaPlan IrelandRehabilitation of Basic Infrastructure in Hambantota District200,000Sri LankaTrócaireShort to Mid Term Response to the South Asia Crisis200,000Sri LankaWorld Vision IrelandFood, Non-Food and Dry Rations200,000Sri LankaHabitat for HumanityHousing Programme249,500Sri LankaConcern Worldwide (March)Emergency Rehabilitation and Livelihood Dev.

These objectives and the provisions governing the ESDP are set out in the treaties of Amsterdam and of Nice, which were approved by referendum. In this context, the European Union is increasing its ability to contribute to both the civilian and military dimensions of crisis management.Over the past year, the ESDP has become increasingly operational. Following significant preparatory work undertaken by the Irish Presidency, the EU launched Operation Althea in December last year, a follow-on military crisis management mission to the previous NATO-led SFOR mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the largest ESDP mission to date. A total of 7,000 personnel from 33 countries are participating, including 54 members of the Irish Defence Forces. The mission is authorised by a Chapter VII UN mandate, as was the case for SFOR.On 15 September 2005, the EU, together with five members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, ASEAN, as well as Norway and Switzerland, deployed a monitoring mission in Aceh, Indonesia. This civilian mission within the ESDP framework is designed to monitor the implementation of various aspects of the peace agreement set out in the memorandum of understanding signed by the Government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement on 15 August 2005. Three members of the Defence Forces are currently serving with this mission.In addition, the work of the EU police missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, is continuing, with the former headed by Assistant Commissioner Kevin Carty of the Garda Síochána. A European Union Police Mission in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, EUPOL Kinshasa, was launched in April 2005; this is the first civilian mission for crisis management in Africa within the ESDP framework.The EU is continuing to develop its capabilities for crisis management, both military and civilian. The European Defence Agency, established last year, is intended to play a central role in addressing shortfalls in European capabilities. It has functions in the areas of defence capabilities development, armaments co-operation, the defence industry and research and technology. The agency aims to ensure that the defence forces of EU member states are properly equipped to carry out crisis management missions.The development of the battlegroups-rapid response elements concept has been an important focal point for ESDP. Member states have committed up to 13 battlegroup formations which will be available on a rotational basis to deploy to crisis situations within a five to ten day period, to carry out the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management operations, including peacemaking. As I have stated in my reply to a separate question by Deputy Gormley, an interdepartmental group, which includes representatives of my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Attorney General's office is currently considering the policy, legislative and operational issues surrounding Ireland's possible participation.The European Union is also examining how existing civilian capabilities can be further developed to ensure a more rapid and flexible EU response to crisis situations. The aftermath of the tsunami has demonstrated the importance of developing such a capability. The Government is following this exercise closely, and will seek to identify how Ireland can best contribute to overall international efforts to assist in large-scale rapid onset emergency situations.It is important to distinguish between the European Security and Defence Policy, which continues to develop, and the possibility of a common defence. Any move to a common defence would be for decision by the European Council acting unanimously and in accordance with member states' constitutional requirements. At present it is important to distinguish between the European Security and Defence Policy, which continues to develop, and the possibility of a common defence. Any move to a common defence would be for decision by the European Council acting unanimously and in accordance with member states' constitutional requirements. At present, there are no proposals for such a move. In any event, Ireland's position is clear. The amendment to Bunreacht na hÉireann in October 2002 precludes Ireland from participating in a common defence. As a consequence, the Irish people would have to amend Bunreacht na hÉireann before Ireland could take part in a common defence.

The continuing house arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, other opposition activists and a number of MPs elected in 1990 remains of grave concern to Ireland and our EU partners.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, representing Ireland at the opening session of the Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, of foreign ministers on 6 May 2005 in Kyoto, Japan, expressed Ireland's grave disappointment and concern that the Burmese authorities had failed to create the conditions for political parties to participate in the national convention, now in recess. He also urged the Burmese authorities to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners. European and Asian foreign ministers participating in the meeting collectively expressed to the Burmese Foreign Minister their concern at the situation in Burma and expressed the hope that all restrictions on the democratisation process would be lifted at the earliest possible opportunity.On 7 May 2005, the EU Troika of foreign ministers met the Burmese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. U Nyan Win, in the margins of the ASEM meeting and expressed similar concerns about the situation in Burma. The EU Troika called on the Burmese authorities to enter into a constructive dialogue with the opposition National League for Democracy, NLD, other legitimate representative bodies and ethnic groups. The EU Troika also called for the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners. The Troika further appealed to the Burmese authorities to establish permanent and sincere co-operation with the UN Secretary General's special envoy in Burma, Mr. Razali Ismail, the special rapporteur on the situation on human rights in Burma, Mr. Sergio Pinheiro, and with all relevant UN agencies. The Burmese Foreign Minister undertook to consider the demands expressed by the EU, but I regret that in the period since then there has been no progress.In my statement on behalf of Ireland at the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly on 19 September, I referred to the continuing denial of human rights and democracy in Burma. I stated that this was most acutely symbolised by the continued detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and that her ordeal was not forgotten by the people of Ireland. I pointed out that the cumulative length of her detention is now very close to ten years.While in the short period since then I have not had the opportunity to raise these issues again with Burma's neighbouring countries as has been suggested, I assure the Deputies that I will avail of all opportunities to raise and to repeat our long-standing concerns in the period ahead. The Government's continuing goal and that of the EU remains the release and restoration of liberty to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, the return of democracy to Burma, an end to human rights violations there and the realisation of peace and prosperity for the long-suffering people of Burma.

At the most recent meeting of the Council which I attended in Luxembourg on 3 October, we discussed developments in the light of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza and adopted detailed conclusions setting out the priorities for progress in the period ahead.In common with our partners in the EU, the Government firmly believes that the quartet roadmap remains the best framework for the achievement of a lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The challenge now is to build on the progress of disengagement and to renew efforts towards full implementation of the roadmap. We are all agreed that there are obligations on both sides and that parallel movement will be required. The EU will strongly support Israel and the Palestinian Authority in renewing the momentum towards a peaceful settlement. We will continue to support the quartet special envoy, Mr. James Wolfensohn, in his efforts to broker agreement on a border regime for Gaza and on measures to give Gaza the prospect of a secure and economically viable future.The Government and its partners in the EU will continue to encourage the Palestinian Authority to strengthen security. The violence of the past week has been disappointing. We strongly condemn terrorist attacks on Israel and we have urged the Israeli authorities to demonstrate appropriate restraint in their response. As I stated in my address to the UN General Assembly on 19 September, the Government also believes it is essential that Israel takes no further steps, including settlement expansion in the West Bank, which could jeopardise the viability of a two-state solution.

The goals correspond to Development Co-operation Ireland's focus on reducing poverty and supporting the provision of basic services to the poorest people. Deputies will be aware that the Taoiseach announced on 14 September in New York that our official development assistance will reach the target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012, three years earlier than the agreed EU deadline of 2015. A proportion of this increased funding will be devoted to such purposes as combating HIV-AIDS, malaria and other communicable diseases, assisting countries in emergency situations and in reconstruction following conflict. We are continuing our programme of support to education, basic health services, water and sanitation in the seven countries where we have established co-operation programmes and will be looking at the possibilities for extending such co-operation to other similar countries. We provide substantial support to the work of Irish non-governmental organisations in the development field as well as to the major UN bodies such as UNICEF, UNDP and the High Commissioner for Refugees.The timetable we have set ourselves places Ireland in the forefront of donors worldwide. On the basis of current anticipated growth rates, spending on ODA would be of the order of €1.5 billion in 2012 and would be maintained at that level at least in subsequent years. We have interim targets of 0.5% of GNP in 2007 and 0.6% in 2010. In regard to UN reform, I refer the Deputy to the Minister's reply today to Question No 1 on this issue.

An EU Troika meeting with Pakistan at foreign minister level took place in Luxembourg on 27 April 2005. Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri briefed the EU side on political developments in Pakistan and on Pakistan's dialogue with India. Other political issues discussed included Afghanistan, non-proliferation, effective multilateralism and counter-terrorism. The most recent bilateral political level contact was the visit by my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, to Pakistan in February 2004 when he led an EU ministerial Troika visit.

The headquarters staffing complement comprises 99 general and diplomatic service officers and 26 specialists. There are 19 specialists and 17 general and diplomatic service officers serving abroad. Some 250 local staff are employed by our missions on the ground to deal with a variety of tasks ranging from project implementation, monitoring and accounting to security, transport and other support services.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	488	Education is one of the most important instruments for reducing poverty and inequality and for laying the basis for sustained economic growth. The importance of every child in every country having the opportunity to complete primary school education forms the basis of the Dakar framework for action agreed in Senegal at the World Education Forum in 2000. The goals agreed in Dakar were reaffirmed as part of the UN's millennium summit in September 2000. Ireland is deeply committed to contributing to the attainment by 2015 of universal primary education for boys and girls everywhere.Since the early 1990s basic education has been a priority area of the Government's official development co-operation programme. Over 13% of the entire programme is focused on supporting education. Most of this support is delivered at country level, with a smaller proportion of funding directed to global and regional education initiatives. Our overall aim is to assist partner countries to build sustainable education systems appropriate to the needs of the people and the country. While subscribing to the goals and targets set internationally, we support the achievement of locally set objectives which are developed in consultation with stakeholders in education in-country.Our approach in the education sector recognises that basic education is the fundamental building block to participation in all levels of education and that the inter-linkages between the different levels of education are becoming more apparent. Expanding secondary education is now considered to be essential to motivate children to complete primary school and therefore be able to access secondary school. In addition, secondary education has been shown to be effective in preventing the spread of HIV-AIDS.Support to education will therefore remain a priority for the development programme. Investment in education in Ireland has provided the basis of much of our recent success. In the developing world, our support to education is a reflection of our own experience and our belief that it is one of the basic pillars of social and economic development.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	489	The excellent report of the task force on policy regarding emigrants provides us with a valuable framework for action. Many of its recommendations require sustained action over time from all partners in both Government and the voluntary sector. However, considerable progress continues to be made, with action under way on more than two thirds of the report's recommendations. Most importantly, the establishment of a dedicated unit — the Irish abroad unit — in the Department of Foreign Affairs is driving progress on the areas identified by the task force.Funding for emigrant services has also increased very substantially. This year the allocation is more than eight times greater than in 1997. In all, grants in 2005 will amount to €8.273 million, representing a 63% increase on last year. In this regard, I have recently announced significant increases to groups in Britain, the US and Ireland. A particular priority is the need to support our most vulnerable and marginalised communities abroad, such as our older community in Britain and undocumented Irish people in the United States. Agencies involved at the front line in this critical work are receiving substantial additional funding this year. These agencies are also involved in the provision of pre-departure services and in assistance to emigrants wishing to return to Ireland, both areas particularly identified by the task force.My Department will continue to maintain close and active contact with frontline organisations to ensure the voluntary sector has an effective channel of communication with the Government and that everything possible is done to help and advance the interests of our emigrant communities, their most vulnerable members in particular.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	491	I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 80 together.In the lead-up to last month's high level plenary meeting of the United Nations in New York, Ireland was a strong supporter of the proposal to establish a standing human rights council which was among the recommendations of the United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan. In this context, the decision at the summit to establish a human rights council is one which we view as positive and it was welcomed by the Taoiseach and I in our statements at the UN last month.Negotiations on the make-up, remit and work practices of the council will soon begin under the chairmanship of the president of the General Assembly, Mr. Jan Eliasson. In my initial reaction to the decision to establish the council, I called on the General Assembly to move swiftly to flesh out the council's modalities and structure. It must be composed and operate in a way which avoids the failings of the past. However, the best features of the Commission on Human Rights, which the council will replace, must be retained.Under the United Kingdom's Presidency, the EU is co-ordinating its input into the negotiations on the human rights council. Ireland is actively contributing to this process and has underlined certain key points in respect of the council. In our discussions with EU partners, we have stressed that it is paramount that the council should be a standing body with the ability to address serious and urgent human rights situations. It is also essential that the participation in the council by non-governmental organisations and civil society allows at least the same degree of access as they enjoy at the Commission on Human Rights.In addition, it is crucial that the negotiated outcome should provide for a smooth transition between the Commission on Human Rights and the human rights council. This would apply in particular to issues such as the carry-over of mandates of special procedures from the commission to the council. These special procedures, such as special rapporteurs of the commission, ensure a degree of scrutiny on specific thematic or country situations of particular concern to the global community. The establishment of a robust human rights council, together with other proposed changes, should lead to a stronger and more effective United Nations and to an enhanced focus on human rights issues.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 117 together.The Government remains gravely concerned regarding developments in Zimbabwe, particularly in the aftermath of the clearance campaign known as Operation Restore Order launched by the Zimbabwean Government last May which has resulted in more than 700,000 people being left homeless. The disastrous humanitarian consequences of this clearance operation have been well described in the report prepared by Ms Anna Tibaijuka, the special envoy appointed by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to examine the consequences of Operation Restore Order, which she presented last July. This report makes clear that Operation Restore Order was carried out in an indiscriminate and unjustified manner, with indifference to human suffering and in disregard of international law. I very much regret that the Mugabe Government has failed completely to act on Ms Tibaijuka's recommendations, including holding to account those responsible for Operation Restore Order, and would urge it to do so and to make immediate restitution to all those made homeless or left jobless as a result of its actions.In the meantime, the political, economic and humanitarian situation within Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate, with an estimated 3 million people, or 25% of the population, likely to require food aid in 2005-2006. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, will meet the executive director of the World Food Programme, WFP, on 7 October to discuss the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Africa, including in Zimbabwe. Ireland contributed €500,000 in June to the WFP for emergency feeding programmes in Zimbabwe and is considering a further contribution in response to an appeal for $30 million which the UN has recently launched to assist the victims of Operation Restore Order. The Irish Embassy in South Africa also continues to monitor the situation in Zimbabwe closely and the Irish ambassador will travel to Zimbabwe later this week to report further on the current political and humanitarian situation.At the end of August, the Zimbabwean Parliament approved a series of constitutional amendments which represent a further serious assault on basic human rights and freedoms in Zimbabwe. These changes allow the Government to nationalise all remaining farm land without any right of legal appeal and to impose travel bans on those suspected of undermining the national interest. In light of these developments, the deteriorating human rights situation in Zimbabwe merits attention at the current General Assembly session in New York and I hope the EU will be successful in promoting acceptance of this viewpoint.International pressure clearly needs to be maintained on the Mugabe Government to alter its current policies. The African Union and Zimbabwe's neighbours in the Southern Africa Development Community, SADC, clearly can play a potentially useful role in exerting influence on the Zimbabwe Government. I welcomed the initiative of the African Union in requesting former Mozambican President Chissano to act as a mediator in encouraging political dialogue within Zimbabwe and encourage the African Union to continue its efforts, notwithstanding the negative response to date of the Zimbabwean Government.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 60, 63 and 89 together.The Taoiseach and I, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, represented Ireland at the UN 2005 World Summit which took place in New York from 14 to 16 September. As Deputies are aware, I was invited by Secretary General Annan to act as one of five envoys mandated to present the case to governments for the wide-ranging recommendations contained in his report, In Larger Freedom for decision at the Summit, and to help lay the groundwork for a summit outcome that would reinforce the multilateral system and enhance the capacity of the United Nations to address the threats and challenges of the 21st century. In that role, I held discussions with 46 foreign minister colleagues and engaged with the media wherever possible on my visits. I am satisfied that my role and that of the other envoys made a positive contribution to the summit's outcome. My formal role as envoy ended at the conclusion of the summit but I will continue to take a close and active interest in the issue of UN reform and particularly in the implementation of the agreements reached at the summit.The Secretary General's recommendations for decision were based on the premise that without development there can be no security, without security there can be no development, and without respect for human rights there can be neither. The Secretary General's recommendations for decision were based on the premise that without development there can be no security, without security there can be no development, and without respect for human rights there can be neither. While the summit did not achieve on this occasion everything Ireland and other like-minded countries would have wished, the outcome document agreed by leaders at the summit nonetheless contains important commitments and agreements on critical issues in the areas of development, security and human rights. It also sets out a programme of reform of the UN and of its secretariat to equip it better to meet today's challenges and to help enhance political and public confidence in the organisation.The outcome unequivocally commits states to the millennium development goals and to implementing the mutual obligations on development contained in the 2002 Monterrey consensus. Donor countries agreed to step up efforts on official development assistance, financing for development and debt. Developing countries are committed to ensuring the effective use of assistance through sound policies, good governance and the rule of law, as well as through the implementation of comprehensive national development strategies and the management of their public finances in an effective and transparent manner. The potential of trade liberalisation in the promotion of development is also recognised, as is the need to meet obligations on sustainable development and on climate change.It is a matter of particular satisfaction to the Government that the imperative to meet the special needs of Africa and to combat HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases was acknowledged.As Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach in his address to the summit committed Ireland to reaching the UN ODA target of 0.7% of GNI by 2012, three years ahead of the EU target, and to reaching an interim target of 0.5% by 2007.The summit reached important decisions in the area of security. It reaffirmed the authority of and primary responsibility of the Security Council to mandate coercive action. It supported the efforts of the EU and other regional bodies to develop peace support capacities, including for rapid deployment, stand-by and bridging arrangements.For too long, countries in a post-conflict phase have not received the necessary help from the UN and the international community to strengthen their institutions and economies so as to avoid a return to strife. The decision to establish a peace building commission by the end of this year to mobilise resources for this purpose, and co-ordinate their application on the ground is therefore greatly to be welcomed.The General Assembly has been mandated to complete and adopt a counter-terrorism strategy on the lines of that proposed by the Secretary General and to conclude without delay the negotiation of a comprehensive international convention on terrorism.Leaders reaffirmed universal human rights and agreed on the need to strengthen the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. For the first time they collectively acknowledged the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. This agreement on the responsibility to protect is an important concrete achievement of the summit. They decided to double the budget of the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, to enable it better to assist states to implement their obligations to their citizens in this area.The summit decided in principle to establish a human rights council to replace the Commission on Human Rights. Negotiations on its establishment are to be completed as soon as possible in the 60th session of the General Assembly, although some difficult issues remain outstanding. A key concern for Ireland is that the positive aspects of the CHR, in particular the involvement of civil society, should be preserved in the new body. The summit agreed to strengthen the human rights mechanisms of the UN through a doubling over five years of the budget of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.The summit also supported the Secretary General in his efforts to strengthen the UN's secretariat and its management, and invited him to come forward with further proposals in this regard. Ireland and its EU partners are working together with like-minded countries to ensure that the General Assembly moves as rapidly as possible towards the implementation of these commitments and decisions. I will remain closely engaged with the UN reform process.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I read with interest the newspaper article by former EU Commissioner, Chris Patten, which is the subject of the Deputy's question. Mr. Patten was an excellent EU External Relations Commissioner and is a good friend of Ireland's. While I would agree with him on many issues, and while he is undoubtedly right to pose searching questions, I would not fully share his assessment of EU-China relations as set out in the article.The year 2005 marks the 30th anniversary of EU-China relations. A broad EU-China dialogue was formally established in 1994 in recognition of China's status as an emerging power on the international scene. This dialogue has grown into a regular, structured series of meeting at several political and official levels. Annual EU-China Summits at Heads of State or Government level have contributed to upgrading the dialogue and providing a strategic vision for the fast growing relationship. The eighth EU-China Summit took place in Beijing on 5 September 2005. Both sides agreed at the summit to move towards early negotiations on an EU-China framework agreement — an initiative very much in line with Chris Patten's wish to see the EU adopting a consistent and coherent strategy in relation to China. The EU is determined to intensify the dialogue in all areas, economic and political. The EU also attaches great importance to its human rights dialogue with China.Where economic matters are concerned, I would agree with Mr. Patten that the EU has been correct to work assiduously to bring China into the World Trade Organisation. There are benefits for all in having China play its part in the rules-based multilateral trading system. In the context of the recent difficulties which arose in trade in textile products following the ending of the multi-fibre agreement, and when a surge in imports of textile products from China into the EU created a number of difficulties, it proved possible for the EU to negotiate with China on a transitional arrangement to cope with these.Mr. Patten rightly points out the enormous economic potential of China in general, its role as a manufacturer of consumer goods and its attraction as a market for exports from the European Union and other sources. I would agree with him wholeheartedly that a prosperous and stable China is better for all than an impoverished and divided China. The article also refers to the EU arms embargo against China. I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 54 of today.

We support the lifting of the embargo but we do not wish to see any increase in the quantity or quality of arms exports to China. This position was set out by the Taoiseach during his visit to Beijing in January 2005, when he also explained the importance to Ireland and the EU of continued progress in the promotion and protection of human rights in China.The European Council meeting on 16-17 June 2005 was the most recent occasion that the arms embargo was discussed with EU counterparts. The Council recalled the conclusions of its December 2004 meeting, welcomed the progress made to date on the revision of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and the so-called "Toolbox" and invited the Council to continue its work on that basis.At its December 2004 meeting, the European Council had reaffirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the arms embargo while underlining that the result of any decision should not be an increase in arms exports from EU member states to China. The Council also recalled the importance of the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which has been in operation since 1998 and contains criteria for assessing such exports, including those relating to human rights, stability and security in the relevant region and the national security of friendly countries. The Council stressed the importance of the early adoption of a revised code of conduct, on which work is continuing and which will reinforce existing EU controls, and of a new instrument on arms exports known as the "Toolbox". This instrument is being developed by the EU and comprises a set of measures which may be applied to a country when an arms embargo against it has been lifted. Essentially, it will provide for a greater level of information sharing and enhanced transparency within the EU regarding arms exports to countries previously subject to an arms embargo. Discussions on the "Toolbox" continue at official level and are progressing well.As the EU works towards lifting the arms embargo, it has also engaged in a dialogue on the issue at senior official level with key partners, including the US, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia. The EU approach was conveyed to Chinese Foreign Minister Li when he met the Troika of EU Foreign Ministers at the EU-China ministerial meeting held in Beijing from 11-12 May 2005. The lifting of the arms embargo was also among the issues discussed during the eighth EU-China Summit that took place in Beijing on 5 September.The Government continues to examine this issue with our EU partners, in the context of our overall relationship with China, our ongoing commitment to human rights and the broader regional and international context. EU Ministers will resume consideration of a decision on lifting the embargo once technical work on revising the code of conduct has been completed. A decision to lift the embargo will require unanimous approval among member states.

The March 2004 European Council agreed that, if this were to be the case, withdrawal should take place in the context of the roadmap; that it should be a step towards a two-state solution; that it must not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank; that there must be an organised and negotiated handover of responsibility to the Palestinian Authority; and that Israel should facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza.I have warmly welcomed the courage and commitment shown by the Government of Israel in ensuring that the initial phase of disengagement from Gaza proceeded peacefully, and ahead of schedule. I have also welcomed the determination of the Palestinian Authority to take full advantage of the opportunity presented by the withdrawal. It is important that the parties build on this progress and renew their efforts towards full implementation of the roadmap. They must maintain their efforts to reach agreement on the steps required under the Wolfensohn action plan, concerning free the movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza. It is in the interests of all parties that Gaza now has a real prospect of stability, security and economic recovery.

The Government believes that it must be respected. The Government, and its partners in the EU, have reaffirmed this position on many occasions. Ireland supported UN General Assembly Resolution ES/10/15 which was adopted by an overwhelming majority in response to the International Court of Justice advisory opinion.The EU has consistently affirmed its position regarding the legality of Israel's actions in constructing the separation barrier, and in particular with regard to its route. We recognise absolutely Israel's right to provide for the security of its citizens, but the construction of the separation barrier on occupied territory represents an obstacle to the implementation of the quartet roadmap and therefore to the prospects for a peaceful and lasting settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I am also very concerned at its humanitarian and economic consequences, and the infringements of recognised principles of human rights for the Palestinian population.On the issue of settlements, the Government has consistently taken the view that the transfer by an occupying power of its own population into occupied territory constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The establishment of settlements by the Israeli authorities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is contrary to international law. The Government has conveyed its concerns on these issues directly to the Israeli Government on many occasions. I raised them when I met Foreign Minister Shalom inJerusalem on 12 July.At its most recent meeting at ministerial level, the international quartet noted with concern the route of the Israeli separation barrier, particularly as it results in the confiscation of Palestinian land, cuts off the movement of people and goods, and undermines Palestinians' trust in the roadmap process as it appears to prejudge the final borders of a Palestinian state.The General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended in Luxembourg on 3 October, reiterated the grave concern of the EU at the ongoing expansion of settlements and the continuing construction of the separation barrier in occupied Palestinian territory. The Council reiterated the clear position that these activities form an obstacle to peace and threaten to make any solution based on the co-existence of two states physically impossible. It called on Israel to stop settlement expansion and to remove unauthorised outposts.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	499	International co-operation is an essential element in the campaign against international terrorism. Ireland has played, and will continue to play, its full part in international efforts to defeat this scourge of our times. Of course, given that terrorism has the potential to affect almost every aspect of our lives, it is not possible to describe in detail every action undertaken by Ireland to confront it.Ireland participates in the efforts of multilateral organisations, in particular those of the United Nations, the European Union, the OSCE and the Council of Europe, in their engagement against international terrorism. Ireland also plays its part in the counter-terrorist work undertaken by specialist international organisations such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and the financial action task force of the OECD. In addition, Ireland maintains regular bilateral contacts on this issue with partners in Europe, North America and further afield. These contacts cover a wide-range of areas — diplomatic, legal, financial and law enforcement. They also include specialist contacts in areas such as aviation and transport security, document security, the security of the financial sector and emergency responses.Ireland also implements the provisions of the principal Security Council resolutions relating to terrorism. Resolution 1373 was adopted by the Council in the immediate aftermath of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States. As Ireland was a member of the Council at the time, it participated in the negotiations leading up to its adoption. The resolution requires states to introduce comprehensive financial and legislative measures with a view to developing their counter-terrorist capacity. Ireland reports on a regular basis to the Security Council's counter-terrorism committee in relation to its implementation of the required measures.Resolution 1373 also calls on states to become parties to the 12 existing international conventions against terrorism. Ireland has met that ratification target. In addition, on 16 September last, while attending the United Nations General Assembly, I signed on behalf of Ireland, subject to ratification, the International Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Ireland will also work hard at this session of the General Assembly to secure agreement on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, including an agreed definition of terrorism.Ireland also fulfils its obligations under Security Council Resolution 1267 and related resolutions, which are specifically directed against Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban. Ireland reports to the 1267 sanctions committee on the implementation of those resolutions which cover, inter alia, the freezing of economic assets, travel bans and arms embargoes.At the European Union level, Ireland has played a significant role in shaping the Union's reaction to terrorist outrages. Ireland held the EU Presidency at the time of the Madrid bombings in March 2004. Its co-ordination of the Union response led to the adoption of two documents that still shape and direct the Union's response to terrorism, the European Union declaration on combating terrorism and the revised EU plan of action on combating terrorism. The plan of action comprises 170 individual actions covering all aspects of the Union's activities. These actions have been adjusted and their time tables tightened as the need arises, for example, in response to the London bombings. Much of this work is undertaken by the EU's Justice and Home Affairs Council. Ireland is represented on the Council by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is, of course, responsible for many of the operational aspects of the fight against terrorism.Other Ministers have particular responsibility for aspects of Ireland's counter-terrorist effort, for example, the Minister for Finance in countering the financing of terrorism, the Minister for Transport in ensuring the safety of the transport network, including transport by air, the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources for travel at sea and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for civil protection. The Minister for Defence heads the Government task force on emergency planning, which is charged with overseeing the national response to possible terrorist attacks.As well as contributing to international efforts to defeat terrorist attacks and counter the spread of terrorism, Ireland acts on the basis that it is insufficient to deal with the manifestations of terrorism alone and that it is also necessary to address the factors which contribute to its development. Ireland also operates on the basis that it is necessary to respect human rights at all times in the fight against terrorism.

I very much welcome this development.Turkey has been a candidate for membership of the EU since the Helsinki European Council in December 1999, which agreed that it was destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria applied to the other candidate states. The European Council in Brussels on 16-17 December 2004, decided, on the basis of the Commission's report and recommendation, that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria to enable the opening of accession negotiations. The Council therefore requested the Commission to begin work on a proposal for a negotiating framework and to present it to the Council, with a view to the opening of the accession negotiations on 3 October.The shared objective of the negotiations is accession. It will be an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed in advance. The negotiations will be based on Turkey's own merits and the pace will depend on the country's progress in meeting requirements for membership. Given the financial consequences of Turkish accession, the framework makes clear that negotiations can only be concluded after the establishment of the financial framework for the period from 2014, together with possible consequential financial reforms. Throughout the negotiations, the Union will expect Turkey to sustain the process of reform which it has already begun, and to work towards further improvements, including in respect of the principles of liberty, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.Parallel to the negotiations, the Union will also engage with Turkey in an intensive political and civil society dialogue with the aim of enhancing mutual understanding. The negotiating process will undoubtedly be lengthy and challenging. The Government, with our partners in the Union, looks forward to engaging positively with Turkey on the issues involved.

Ireland announced the establishment of diplomatic relations on a non-resident basis with Burma on 13 February 2004. However, given that the progress which had been anticipated in 2004, most notably the meeting of an open and unhindered national convention and the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, did not materialise, the Government decided to put on hold the exchange of ambassadors. The Government's continuing goal, and that of the EU, remains the release and restoration of liberty to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and others under house arrest, the return of democracy to Burma, an end to human rights violations, and the realisation of peace and prosperity for the long suffering people of Burma.

The management response to the report noted that a number of the recommended actions had either been implemented or were under active consideration prior to the publication of the report in July 2005. I am keenly aware of the need to ensure both effectiveness and value for money in Ireland's development assistance programme. This report is a timely and worthwhile contribution towards meeting these objectives and will inform our actions in this area in the future.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	503	By the late 1990s, the systems in the Passport Office for processing applications were in urgent need of replacement. The technology was obsolete and in some cases no longer supported by the manufacturers. The Passport Office was reliant on a single engineer who had been involved in the original installation of the system to maintain it. The volume of passport applications had grown to the point where the system was overloaded, frequently breaking down and in danger of collapse. The Department was concerned that it was not in a position to provide the high level of service that citizens had a right to expect and that, in a worst case scenario, it might even be unable to issue travel documents in a timely manner to applicants.KPMG Consulting, which was subsequently renamed and is currently trading under the name BearingPoint, was retained by the Department to review the operation of the passport service and make recommendations for its replacement. Its initial report was provided to the Department in March 1999 and a subsequent report in October 2000 provided an update on certain technical aspects.The Department appointed a separate consultancy company to provide assistance on procurement matters and to prepare a request for tender, RFT. In order to guarantee fair competition, it was decided to include as much information as possible about the existing system, including the substance of the KPMG reports, in the RFT. The costs in the October 2000 report were accordingly described as outline costs which would provide a general overview of the cost of developing the new system. The specification in the RFT of the functional requirements for the new system was much more detailed and it was on this basis that the different tenders were submitted.The Department consulted the Department of Finance, CMOD, at all stages, both to obtain sanction for the project and to ensure that appropriate procurement procedures were followed for this contract. The Department of Foreign Affairs is satisfied that sufficient information and time was available to the market to ensure fair competition.In the event, 27 companies took part in the initial tender process and bids were received from six companies. The successful bid was presented by an international consortium, headed by BearingPoint as lead consortium member, and was the less expensive of two bids which were regarded as technically acceptable. The Department is satisfied that the procedures adopted in this case were fully in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines and followed close co-ordination with that Department. However, the Department is reviewing its procedures for future contracts in the light of the questions raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General and its experience with the project.The new Irish passport is widely regarded as one of the most advances and secure travel documents in the world. It has been acknowledged by the US authorities as superb and is accepted as fully meeting the new security standards set by the US for visa waiver countries from October 2005. As the Deputy will appreciate, the security of travel documents has taken on even more importance in the post 11 September 2001 context.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 84 and 170 together.I remain deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Sudan, particularly in the Darfur region of western Sudan. As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a recent escalation in violence in west Darfur with attacks on internally displaced persons, IDPs, humanitarian workers and members of the African Union Mission in Sudan. These attacks have been widely condemned and underline the continuing vulnerability and humanitarian needs of the affected population in this region. On 3 October 2005 EU foreign ministers condemned these attacks, reiterated their deep concern at violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed against the civilian population in Darfur, and called on all sides to rein in their fighters, respect international law and find a peaceful solution to the conflict. More than two million people have been displaced from their homes, including some 200,000 across the border into Chad, as a result of the conflict in Darfur. These highly vulnerable populations are located in IDP and refugee camps run by international non-governmental organisations, the Red Cross movement and assisted by the UN.The political and humanitarian situation in the Darfur region of Sudan remains a matter of the deepest concern for Ireland. Sustained international pressure needs to be exerted on all the parties to honour their commitments, improve the security situation and achieve a speedy political settlement. Ireland fully supports the African Union-mediated peace talks under way in Abuja, Nigeria. Ireland welcomes the decision of 31 March 2005 by the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Darfur since mid-2002 to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. This will mean that those accused by the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur of extremely serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law can now be brought to justice by this court, of which Ireland is a strong supporter.I visited Darfur in April of this year and witnessed at first hand the effects of the conflict on the displaced population. I also met representatives of NGOs and UN agencies working in Darfur and was deeply impressed with the quality of the assistance which they are providing to the sizeable displaced population. I was also struck by the importance of providing a secure environment so that these displaced populations will be able to return safely to their homes.My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, met the acting Foreign Minister of Sudan, Dr. Mustafa Osman Ismail, in New York on 19 September 2005. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, stressed the importance which Ireland attaches to resolving the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, the need for improvement of the security situation there and speedy conclusion of the political negotiations under way in Abuja between the government and the rebels.Since 2004, Ireland has provided more than €8.8 million in emergency support to Darfur. This has been allocated to NGOs, including Concern, GOAL and Trócaire, and UN agencies. This funding is being channelled primarily to address humanitarian needs, particularly food security, nutrition and medical interventions. Ireland has committed €1.5 million since 2004 in support to the human rights, humanitarian and peace-building components of the African Union Mission in Sudan, AMIS.With regard to the humanitarian situation in the rest of Sudan, more than 20 years of civil conflict has decimated the infrastructure and services of this vast country. The comprehensive peace agreement signed in Nairobi on 9 January 2005 provides new hope for the future of Sudan. The new Sudanese Government of National Unity, GNU, was established in July, when the new constitution came into effect, with Dr. John Garang as first Vice President. In addition to the major challenges of implementing the comprehensive peace agreement and reconstructing south Sudan, the new government will also have to resolve the conflict in Darfur and a recent outbreak of violence in eastern Sudan. Equitable sharing of power and wealth among Sudan's various tribal and regional groupings is the fundamental issue underlying these various conflicts.The first major test of the GNU came when Dr. Garang was killed in a helicopter accident in southern Sudan on 30 July. However, the parties' reaction to the death of Dr. Garang revealed a remarkable capacity to recover from this major setback and a determination to maintain the peace process. Commander Salva Kiir Mayardit, the new leader of the SPLM, has been appointed as first Vice President. Both he and President Bashir have reiterated their commitment to ensure the successful implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement. Formation of the GNU was completed on 21 September 2005. The interim constitution for south Sudan has also been finalised and formation of the south Sudan Government is under way.At the international donor conference on Sudan, which was held in Oslo on 11 and 12 April 2005, I made a pledge of €15 million in support from Ireland to Sudan over the period 2005 to 2007. Already in 2005, Ireland has committed some €8 million of its pledge in support to Sudan. Programming of the remainder of Ireland's support will be consistent with the UN's recovery and reconstruction plans for Sudan. Emergency and recovery funding support of €1.7 million for the south of Sudan has been provided in 2005, inter alia, to Concern, Trócaire, Médecins Sans Frontières, the UN world food programme and UNICEF. Ireland continues to attach considerable importance to supporting emergency humanitarian and recovery needs in Sudan.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	505	The Government has been consistent in condemning all sectarian attacks. In the Good Friday Agreement, the parties and the two Governments affirmed the right of everyone to be free from sectarian harassment, and it is a key priority of the Government to see that this promise becomes a reality.Where there are disputes with regard to parades, they can only be resolved through dialogue and positive engagement with the Parades Commission. We have seen what can be achieved with the main Orange Order march on 12 July in Derry this year where, for the first time in 13 years, cross-community agreement was sought and reached for a route, including the city side of the Foyle. It has shown that it is possible, through leadership and genuine commitment to constructive negotiation, to end damaging cycles of confrontation and, in time, begin new traditions of mutual respect.With regard to the worrying pattern of sectarian attacks witnessed in recent months, my officials have been in constant contact with representatives of both communities to discuss their concerns. In addition, I made a number of visits to west Belfast and County Antrim to meet those directly affected by the recent violence. I also met separately representatives of the SDLP and Sinn Féin from these areas to hear their views on how best we can ensure that future incidents of this kind are prevented. I have also raised the issue in my discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and will do so again at the forthcoming meeting of the BIIGC.This is a critical issue. A day of violence can undermine months of patient work to build trust between communities. It is essential that those with influence in their communities, in particular political leaders, exercise their influence to promote calm and restraint. If the people of Northern Ireland are to be free of fear and the threat of violence, it requires that all those who claim to lead do all in their power to prevent religious or sectarian violence continuously and without exception.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Since 2004, an early end to the rains and desert locust damage to crops and pasture lands adversely affected pasture availability and cereal production in the Sahel region of west Africa. These events exacerbated existing poverty and vulnerability resulting in severe food shortages across a wide region, including in Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Mauritania.In response to the food crisis, Ireland provided funding support of €3 million in August 2005. This was allocated and disbursed to Ireland's non-governmental organisations and UN partners. Approved funding proposals included key NGOs, notably Concern, GOAL, Trócaire and the Irish Red Cross. Funding was also provided to UN partners, the World Food Programme and the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA. The Irish NGOs which received support are delivering feeding programmes which range from supplementary food distributions directed at the most vulnerable women and children to targeted community therapeutic feeding of moderately and severely malnourished children.In addition to this funding, I asked Mr. David Andrews, chairman of the Irish Red Cross, to report on the findings of his visit to the region. He travelled there in August 2005 accompanied by an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Having assessed the situation, Mr. Andrews reported that the country suffers persistent food insecurity but that extreme food shortages this year were caused by a number of converging factors, particularly the early end to the rains in 2004 which depressed agricultural yields, escalating food prices and an invasion of locusts in some areas. Mr. Andrews estimated that 3.5 million people were in need of emergency food assistance and between 1 million and 2 million people were classed as extremely vulnerable and requiring food assistance urgently.Mr. Andrews also suggested that the international community establish a global fund to tackle food crises more effectively. I have been very supportive of this proposal and have had a number of discussions with our partner governments and the UN aimed at developing such a fund. These discussions have focused on the proposed reforms of the UN Central Emergency Revolving Fund, CERF, to provide UN agencies with access to immediate grant funds, facilitating emergency interventions before crises worsen and directing funds equitably to forgotten crises. In support of this key initiative, Ireland is willing to make a significant pledge to such a reformed and reinforced fund when it is established.According to the latest information from the region, 5.1 million people are affected by the food crisis across the Sahel region, including Niger. Harvest prospects are now being described as favourable. However, Niger remains vulnerable to repeated crises of food insecurity and malnutrition owing to high household indebtedness and structural poverty. With regard to the particular circumstances prevailing in the region, I can assure the Deputy that the humanitarian situation will continue to be kept under close and ongoing review over the coming period.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers and I share the widely held concerns about it. The person concerned was placed under a number of restrictions as a condition of his release from prison in 2004 at the end of the prison sentence which he had served. These restrictions include a prohibition on leaving Israel, and on contacting the media and foreign governments. I understand that the person concerned is still awaiting the outcome of proceedings brought against him in December 2004 relating to breaches of the conditions under which he was released. However, I also understand that the authorities have recently returned computers to him which were confiscated at that time.The Government has consistently taken the view that the person concerned should not be subjected to the restrictions which were imposed, and the Government of Israel is aware of this position. However, the restrictions have been the subject of judicial review by the Israeli Supreme Court, which concluded that they are not incompatible with the Israeli Government's obligations in respect of its citizens. I do not believe that the Israeli Government is likely to reverse its decision in this matter. In the absence of such a development, the issue raised by the Deputy will not arise. The Government will continue to monitor the situation.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	508	The summit meeting of the G8 on 6 and 8 July addressed a number of important issues, some of which have particular relevance for international development. In particular, I warmly welcome the decision to double aid for Africa by 2010. Taken together with the decision of the European Union to devote 0.56% of its gross national income, GNI, to official development assistance by 2010 and to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNI by 2015, this will mean a substantial increase in resources available for developing countries.Each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and it will be recalled that the African leaders who attended the G8 summit discussions reaffirmed their commitment to drive forward plans to reduce poverty and promote economic growth; deepen transparency and good governance; strengthen democratic institutions and processes; show zero tolerance for corruption; remove all obstacles to intra-African trade; and bring about lasting peace and security across the continent.Ireland and other donor countries, for their part, recognise that the quality of aid is an important factor, as well as its volume, in addressing the problems of poverty. The quality of Ireland's development co-operation programme has been internationally recognised and I intend to ensure that this high standard is maintained and developed. We are also working with other donor countries in the OECD to improve the standard of aid effectiveness.The G8 has announced that all the debts owed by eligible heavily indebted poor countries, HIPC, to the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the IMF will be cancelled. This agreement represents significant progress towards solving the problem of the debt burden on poor countries, a problem which has hitherto proved intractable. The Minister for Finance has indicated that Ireland will be prepared to pay its share of the costs involved for the World Bank. Ireland's official policy calls for debt cancellation for all HIPC countries and we will continue to work towards that end.

Up to six people were killed on Tuesday last when a bomb exploded at a key border crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Some 31 suspected Taliban militants and four government troops were reported killed last weekend during fighting near the Pakistani border. On 28 September 2005, at least 12 people were killed and 36 others injured outside an army base in Kabul in what is believed to have been a suicide bombing. This followed other recent suicide bombings.However, the successful holding of provincial and parliamentary elections on 18 September was a very positive development that was welcomed by the EU. The EU statement noted that the Afghan people had shown once again their clear support for a democratic future. It saluted the courage of the thousands of people who had put themselves forward as candidates, despite intimidation and threats to their lives, and of the millions of Afghans who had exercised their freedom to vote. The statement added that the turnout and generally peaceful nature of the elections were a testament to the determination of the Afghan people to see their country succeed.These elections, following on from last year's presidential elections, are a very important milestone on Afghanistan's journey towards democracy. The elections presented a significant logistical, security and political challenge and the initial indications are that the polling was generally conducted peacefully and that the elections were well organised and fair. The participation of large numbers of female candidates and voters was especially positive. Counting of ballots is in progress at the 32 counting centres and partial results are expected soon.The joint electoral management body, JEMB, an independent body set up to administer and oversee the electoral process during Afghanistan's transition period, issued an election day report on 26 September. This indicated that while irregularities certainly occurred, as is inevitable in a post-conflict situation, there was so far nothing to suggest a systematic problem or orchestrated attempt to defraud the electoral process.The EU provided significant support to the electoral process, including financial assistance and the contribution of the largest international election observation mission, headed by Ms Emma Bonino. Ireland funded the participation of an Irish observer in the EU mission. Seven members of the Irish Defence Forces have also been taking part in the UN mandated international security assistance force in Afghanistan.A key element in restoring stability and security to Afghanistan is the disarmament and demobilisation of irregular militia forces. Since I last updated the Dáil on 2 June 2005 on the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process, the disarmament and demobilisation components of the process have been completed. Of the almost 63,000 former combatants who have handed in their weapons, 60,646 have entered or completed the reintegration phase in preparation for a new civilian life. Large numbers of weapons and considerable amounts of ammunition also have been collected and secured in guarded compounds.Ireland has been providing development and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan both prior to and following the events of 11 September 2001. Since January 2000, Ireland has allocated more than €28 million in funding for programmes in Afghanistan. This aid is channelled through UN and international agencies and partner NGOs working to deliver services locally. A core focus of Ireland's support is to assist the Afghan Government and Afghan civil society to meet the priority objectives set out in the national development framework, NDF, for Afghanistan.Afghanistan clearly still faces many challenges in the period ahead and will continue to need the support of the international community. Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, remains committed to a democratic Afghanistan and we look forward to working with the new parliament to ensure peace and prosperity in the country.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	510	Developments in Iraq this year to date have been characterised by significant progress on the political front but against a background of continuing large scale violence and loss of life.Following the democratic elections on 30 January, the new transitional Iraqi Government under Prime Minister Ibrahim Al-Jafaari was formed at the beginning of May. It included representatives of all the major groups in the assembly, including six Sunni ministers. A lengthy negotiating process in the assembly throughout the summer resulted in the adoption of a draft constitution at the end of August. This has been endorsed by the representatives of the Shia and Kurdish communities but has not yet been approved by any of the parties representing the Sunni community. In accordance with the political process mapped out in UN Security Council Resolution 1546, the new constitution will be put to the people in a referendum on 15 October.The UN has reported that preparations for the referendum, which are being overseen by the independent electoral commission of Iraq, are now largely complete. The Deputy will be aware of the concerns which were expressed by the UN following the adoption by the transitional national assembly on 2 October of a resolution regarding the referendum law. I welcome the decision by the assembly yesterday to withdraw the resolution. I believe it is important for the credibility of the constitutional referendum that it is based on an electoral framework which meets international standards.If the referendum is approved, new elections will be held in December for a fully sovereign assembly and government. Winning the support or consent of the Sunni community for the new political structures in Iraq remains an important priority, not least in the interest of bringing an end to the current campaign of violence. Nonetheless, I believe it is important that we recognise that the political developments of recent months represent significant political progress. Political leaders in Iraq are to be congratulated on their courage and their commitment to a democratic future for their country. I hope that all Iraqi citizens will engage in the political process and exercise their vote in the referendum this month.Against this background of progress, however, the security situation continues to give rise to serious concern. Large-scale violence continues across a significant area of central Iraq. In recent months there has been a sustained and lethal campaign directed at the Shia and Kurdish populations. The Government and its partners in the EU have strongly condemned these attacks, which have included a series of suicide and car bomb attacks aimed at innocent people in the vicinity of markets, mosques and police stations. The aim of the attacks seems to be to cause maximum loss of life and to create chaos by dividing the communities in Iraq.The continuing violence is severely hampering the efforts of the Iraqi Government to rebuild its society and economy following three major conflicts, a decade of international isolation and almost three decades of brutal dictatorship. The EU will continue to support the Iraqi government in its efforts, including through significant support for reconstruction, training in Europe for police and criminal justice system officers, and expert support for the political process. The Government and its partners in the EU remain determined to help the people of Iraq as they work to build a democratic, prosperous and peaceful society, based on respect for human rights and the rule of law.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	511	The proposals for a comprehensive agreement, published by the two Governments on 8 December 2004 covered the key issues that must be resolved to finally and definitively assure peace and political stability in Northern Ireland, as the Taoiseach said at that time. They were made public to clarify the context within which the Governments had been working with the parties in Northern Ireland with a view to facilitating the restoration of partnership government and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.As the Deputy is aware, it did not prove possible to reach agreement on the proposals in December 2004. The primary reasons for this were the fact that the IRA was unwilling to commit itself to ending criminal activity clearly and definitively and the lack of consensus on the transparency elements of the decommissioning process.Furthermore, developments in the immediate aftermath of the publication of the proposals such as the Northern Bank robbery and the murder of Robert McCartney meant that the context within which there could be any renewed engagement with the parties on proposals to restore the institutions no longer existed. It was clear at that time that it would not be possible to make further progress until that context changed. The Government underlined this point in its meeting with Sinn Féin on 25 January.More recently, however, there have been a number of significant positive developments, in particular the IRA statement of 28 July announcing an end to its armed campaign and the welcome report of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning on 26 September confirming that the IRA had put all of its weapons beyond use. These developments clearly represent important progress toward the restoration of an appropriate context within which engagement with the political parties can take place to secure a basis for the full operation of the institutions of the agreement. We hope that the IMC reports to be submitted to both Governments later this month and in January 2006 will further enhance the prospects for productive re-engagement.Given that agreement was not reached on the proposals for a comprehensive agreement in December, they cannot be said to have formal standing. However the package published at that time represents the outcome of the most recent negotiations on the restoration of partnership government. As such, it remains an important reference point for future consultation and engagement with all political parties in Northern Ireland once the necessary conditions are in place.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court entered into force on 1 July 2002 and to date has been ratified or acceded to by 99 states. An additional 44 states have signed the statute, subject to ratification.The United States of America signed the Statute of the International Criminal Court in December 2000. However, in May 2002 the US informed the Secretary General of the United Nations that it did not intend to become party to the statute and that it accordingly had no obligations arising from its signature.In August 2002 the US Congress adopted the American Service Members' Protection Act placing restrictions on the extent to which the United States can co-operate with the ICC. The US also has a series of bilateral non-surrender agreements with states which seek to prevent the surrender of US personnel to the Court. No EU member state is party to such an agreement. In December 2004 Congress adopted the Nethercutt amendment which authorises the loss of certain economic aid to countries which have ratified the ICC statute but have not signed a bilateral immunity agreement with the United States.The US objects to the ICC principally on the basis that the independence of the ICC prosecutor endangers US citizens, particularly US military forces, to politically motivated prosecutions before the court. I am not aware of any change or likely change in US policy as regards the International Criminal Court.As I have stated on previous occasions, while I recognise the concerns of the United States, I do not share them. The jurisdiction of the ICC is complementary to national jurisdictions, meaning that the court will become involved in a case only where a state with jurisdiction over a crime is unwilling or unable to carry out a genuine investigation or prosecution. The Rome Statute contains strong and carefully drafted safeguards to prevent politically motivated prosecutions.This view is shared by our EU partners. Approaches have been made to the US on behalf of the EU, outlining the EU position on the court and urging US support for it. In addition, the EU Council conclusions on the ICC of 30 September 2002 recall the shared objective of the EU and the US of individual accountability for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community and call for a broader dialogue between the EU and US on all matters relating to the ICC.I reiterate my hope that, in time, the International Criminal Court will come to enjoy universal support. It is in the interest of each and every state that the most heinous crimes of international concern do not go unpunished. As the United Nations Secretary General stated when the Rome Statute was adopted in July 1998, the ICC is a gift of hope to future generations and a giant step forward in the march towards universal human rights and the rule of law. The Government is committed to the effective functioning of the court and support efforts to ensure the widest possible ratification and implementation of its statute.

This is particularly important with respect to small arms and light weapons, which are responsible for widespread death and injury. Ireland is committed to working with others to ensure that the international community deals with the illicit trafficking of such weapons effectively. In this context, Ireland actively participated in the United Nations negotiations, which concluded last June with agreement on an international instrument to regulate the marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons.Ireland has also taken an active interest in the initiative taken by a number of non-governmental organisations concerning a proposed international arms trade treaty, ATT. Officials from this Department participated in a number of international meetings during which the proposed ATT has been discussed. During Ireland's Presidency of the EU last year we placed this issue on the agenda of the relevant working group in Brussels for initial discussion.EU foreign ministers discussed the issue of the ATT at an informal meeting last month. Following on from those discussions, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, at a meeting on 3 October, acknowledged the growing support throughout the world for an international treaty to establish common standards for the global trade in conventional arms. It also agreed that binding standards, consistent with the existing responsibilities of states under relevant international law, would be critical in tackling proliferation which is undesirable and irresponsible and which undermines peace, security, development, and full respect for human rights in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world. It further agreed that the United Nations was the only forum that could deliver a truly universal instrument and called for the start of a formal process at the UN at the earliest opportunity.The Council encouraged all states, regional organisations and multilateral institutions to join the growing international consensus for action in this area. It also expressed the view that the EU should play an active role in this process, together with like-minded states and regional organisations, and that due consideration should be given to other relevant initiatives, including the 2006 review conference of the UN programme of action to prevent combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. The Government is fully supportive of this approach and looks forward to working with others within the framework of the UN to develop a comprehensive instrument based on universally accepted norms and standards.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	514	As the Deputy will be aware, Kosovo has been under UN administration since the end of the conflict in June 1999, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The head of the UN interim administration mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, has been working closely with the provisional institutions of self-government to encourage the implementation of a wide-ranging reform process, based on European standards, in advance of the consideration of the constitutional status of Kosovo. The EU supports the priority which UNMIK has established for early progress on these reforms which most directly affect the security and rights of minority communities.The UN Secretary General appointed a special representative, Ambassador Kai Eide of Norway, to prepare a comprehensive review of the implementation of reforms based on European standards. If the review is positive, it will be followed by the opening of a process to agree the constitutional status of Kosovo, which will be facilitated by the international community. Earlier this week, Ambassador Eide submitted his report to the UN Secretary General who is expected to forward it to the Security Council together with recommendations in the near future.The EU has given a clear commitment that the long-term future of the western Balkans region, including Kosovo, rests within the European Union and has reaffirmed its commitment to a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo which contributes to the stability of the region and adheres to the values and standards of the EU. In the period ahead, together with our EU partners, we will continue to work in co-operation with the United Nations, with the governments of the region and with the US and other international partners towards the achievement of this objective.The security situation is now calm, but it remains tense. I pay tribute to the work of KFOR, the UN-mandated peacekeeping force in Kosovo, and especially to the contribution of the 210 Irish troops serving with the force, in ensuring security and stability in often difficult circumstances.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	515	The sum of €920,220 was paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs to Murray's Chauffeur Drive Limited for transport services provided in connection with meetings and other events which took place in Ireland during the EU Presidency in 2004. A further sum of €45,166 was paid to the same company by the press section of the Department for transport services provided in connection with the attendance of the national and international media at Presidency related events.The company in question was chosen through a negotiated tendering procedure which was launched in October 2003. A notice seeking expressions of interest was issued to six transport providers. Three proposals were received and two companies were shortlisted and invited to interview. The interview panel comprised representatives of the corporate services and protocol divisions of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Garda Síochána. After considering factors of cost, management skills, personnel, capacity, capability, experience and quality of service, the interview committee reached a unanimous decision on the award of the contract.The decision to proceed by way of a negotiated tender was taken following the conclusion of negotiations on transport sponsorship for the Presidency, a new departure for the Department during this Presidency. Following long and complex negotiations, an offer of sponsorship for transport was confirmed and accepted in October 2003. Until this sponsorship was agreed, the Department's additional transport needs for the Presidency were not known. In view of the time constraints and the absolute need to have transport arrangements in place at the start of the Presidency, the Department felt it had no option but to proceed with a negotiated tender. Sponsorship of various aspects of the Presidency ultimately resulted in an overall saving of approximately €3.5 million. Of that amount, the value of transport sponsorship was an estimated €1.8 million.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The Government fully supports the African Union's crucial role in resolving the ongoing political, security and humanitarian crisis in Darfur, including the very valuable work of its observer mission, AMIS, in addressing the security situation. Where AMIS has been deployed in Darfur a marked reduction in violence has followed. In April, the AU decided to expand AMIS from 3,200 to more than 7,700 personnel by the end of September, and approximately 5,500 are deployed. However, owing to serious logistical and management constraints, full deployment of the additional military personnel will not be completed until 22 October and deployment of two additional civilian police contingents has been postponed.The fact that in May 2005 US$300 million was pledged at a donors' conference in Addis Ababa to assist with the planned expansion of AMIS demonstrates the international community's confidence in the African Union's efforts to try and resolve the Darfur conflict. However, despite these pledges a funding gap of €140 million exists and the AU has appealed urgently for additional support.The General Affairs and External Relations Council agreed on 23 May that the EU should lend all possible support to AMIS's military, police and civilian efforts to address the crisis in Darfur and a specific package of assistance, focusing on logistical and planning support, was outlined by high representative Solana at the subsequent donors' conference in Addis Ababa. Ireland was also represented at the Addis Ababa meeting and pledged to provide additional financial support as part of the overall EU package. When I met UN Secretary General Annan in New York on 2 June I informed him that Ireland would contribute an additional €1 million to support the expanded AMIS operation. This funding is additional to €500,000 for the humanitarian and human rights elements of AMIS which Ireland provided last year. The Government has also made available an officer from the Permanent Defence Forces, Lieutenant Colonel, to serve as a logistics planner in supporting the expansion of AMIS. An Army officer served as an EU observer with the AMIS mission up to June 2005.At the June General Affairs and External Relations Council, Ministers approved a joint action by the European Union providing civilian and military support to AMIS in such areas as police, planning, logistics, strategic and tactical airlift, training and equipment. Ministers also approved the appointment of Mr. PekkaHaavisto, a former Minister from Finland, as EU special representative for Sudan. A total of €2.12 million has been allocated from the 2005 EU budget for this joint action. The EU will also provide €92 million from the Africa Peace Facility, APF, for AMIS and is considering an AU request for a further €70 million.In addition to the EU's funding, much of the equipment and airlifting required by the AU is being provided and funded bilaterally by EU partners. NATO is also providing logistical support to AMIS. Ireland's support to AMIS is additional to the €15 million pledged for Sudan over the period 2005 to 2007, €8 million of which has already been committed. This funding is being used to meet immediate needs such as food security, return of the displaced and basic education and will also begin to address the country's long-term development needs.I met with the acting Foreign Minister of Sudan, Dr. Mustafa Osman Ismail, in New York on 19 September 2005. I stressed the importance which Ireland attaches to resolving the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, the need for improvement of the security situation there and speedy conclusion of the political negotiations under way in Abuja between the Government and the rebels. Minister Ismail gave an optimistic assessment of the humanitarian situation in Darfur and the general political and security situation in Sudan, including the Abuja talks.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	517	While Liberia has made remarkable progress since the comprehensive peace agreement of August 2003, it still faces the major challenges of a successful return to democracy and sustaining the peace process. Parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for 11 October 2005. These elections will mark the return of a constitutional democracy to Liberia after 14 years of civil war. The EU is fielding an election observation mission, with Irish participation. More than 1.35 million voters have been registered.Following a decision on 28 September by the Liberian Supreme Court to allow three independent presidential candidates, previously barred by the National Election Commission, to stand in the polls, there were fears that the election date may be postponed. However it has since been confirmed that the elections will go ahead as planned on 11 October following the withdrawal of the three candidates. This allows compliance with the comprehensive peace agreement which requires the holding of elections in October 2005 and transfer of power to the newly elected Government in January 2006.The security situation in Liberia is stable. This owes much to the United Nations mission in Liberia, which was established on 19 September 2003 by UN Security Council Resolution 1509. The Irish contingent comprises a motorised infantry battalion of some 410 personnel, together with six additional personnel deployed at force headquarters. Our personnel have been widely commended for the professionalism of their work.In addition to our peacekeeping role, earlier this year Ireland established a development co-operation office in Freetown, Sierra Leone, which is also responsible for the delivery of humanitarian and development support to Liberia. At the international donor conference on Liberia in February 2004, Ireland pledged €5 million from 2004 to 2006 towards the recovery and reconstruction needs of Liberia. This pledge has already been met. Ireland has contributed €1 million to the disarmament, demobilisation, rehabilitation and reintegration programme in Liberia. This is particularly important as conditions for a lasting peace remain fragile so long as the reintegration of ex-combatants and retirement of ex-soldiers has not been completed.On 9 September 2005, Liberia's national transitional Government, NTGL, signed a far-reaching plan to combat corruption, called the governance and economic management assistance programme, GEMAP, which had been agreed with the donor community. Effective implementation of this programme would greatly contribute to Liberia's national recovery efforts and help it meet the requirements for lifting of Security Council sanctions regarding the export of timber and diamonds.

The personnel concerned, who also include 14 people with dual Irish and other citizenship, work mainly with non-governmental and international organisations.There is a standing arrangement, provided for in the treaties on the European Union, whereby citizens of any EU country may seek consular assistance from embassies of other EU member states in countries where that country does not have a resident mission. In this regard, there is a particular arrangement in place in Kabul for Irish citizens with the British Embassy. Given the dangerous security situation there, the Department is advising strongly against non-essential travel to Kabul, and against all travel to other parts of Afghanistan.

These local, legislative and presidential elections are expected to take place between March and May 2006. Voter registration is under way, with 13.6 million people already registered out of an estimated potential electorate of 20 million. A referendum on the draft constitution approved by the transitional national assembly last May is planned before the end of this year.The successful holding of national elections in the DRC, the first in over 40 years, will be a major undertaking. Substantial international support will be required for the elections which are likely to cost in the region of US$400 million to organise. These elections are important, not only for the future stability and democratic development of the DRC but also for ensuring peace and security throughout the Great Lakes region as a whole. The EU and its member states have made substantial contributions in support of the electoral process with the European Commission alone pledging some €150 million. I was pleased to be able to announce a national contribution of €500,000 by Ireland in support of the DRC electoral process during my recent meeting with the Foreign Minister of the DRC, Mr. Raymond Ramazani Baya, at the UN General Assembly.During my meeting with Mr. Ramazani Baya, I urged the DRC Government to accelerate progress towards completion of the transition process, including the speedy adoption of an electoral law to govern the forthcoming elections. We also discussed the security situation in eastern DRC which remains serious and the need to complete disarmament of the remaining armed militia groups which continue to pose a serious threat there. The DRC Government and armed forces work in close conjunction with MONUC, the UN peacekeeping mission, to confront the armed militias groups and hasten their disarmament. The problem which these militia groups pose has been compounded in recent weeks by the arrival of 300 or 400 Lord's Resistance Army, LRA, rebels from northern Uganda. Both MONUC and the Congolese army deserve the support of the international community for their efforts. I hope the UN Security Council will consider favourably Mr. Annan's recent request for an additional 2,600 troops to enhance MONUC's capacity for supporting disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants.The DRC Government also needs to hasten progress in the area of security sector reform, particularly with regard to completing the creation of a fully integrated national army and police force and effectively establishing its authority throughout the DRC. This is particularly important if a secure environment is to be created for the holding of national elections. The EU actively supports the process of security sector reform in the DRC through deployment of two EU missions. EUPOL offers advice and mentoring to the integrated police unit, IPU, in Kinshasa which the EU has helped establish. Ireland has contributed €75,000 towards the costs of establishing the IPU. A second mission, EUSEC DRC, comprises a small planning team to advise key government ministries in the DRC on all issues related to security sector reform. EUSEC DRC has made considerable progress in its work and plays a particularly important role in identifying ways to improve administration and command throughout the DRC army and ensure proper payment and rationing of troops.It is equally important, however, that neighbouring countries, in particular, Uganda and Rwanda, do all they can to end the threat posed by the armed militia groups in eastern DRC, support completion of the transition in the DRC and improve bilateral relations throughout the region. The regional dimension to the conflict remains crucial and underlines the importance of the Great Lakes conference process, the second summit of which will take place in Nairobi in December. Ireland is an active member of the Group of Friends of the Great Lakes which supports the conference process and was represented by Minister of State Lenihan at a recent ministerial meeting in New York to discuss preparations for the second summit.

At the same time however, Turkey also issued a declaration stating that its signature, ratification and implementation of the protocol did not amount to recognition of the Republic of Cyprus.In response to this declaration, on 21 September the EU agreed and issued a counter-declaration recalling the status of the Republic of Cyprus as a member state of the EU. The counter-declaration noted that recognition of all member states, including Cyprus, is a necessary component of the accession process and underlined the importance the Union attaches to the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all member states as soon as possible. The EU negotiating framework for the Turkish accession negotiations, which opened on 3 October, reiterated the importance of progress in the normalisation of bilateral relations between Turkey and all member states, including the Republic of Cyprus.

At the end of 2003, with an estimated 5.3 million people living with HIV and AIDS, South Africa had the largest number of individuals living with the virus in a single country. Women contract the virus at a much earlier age than their male counterparts and constitute more than 50% of those infected.The Government of South Africa adopted a national comprehensive HIV-AIDS care, management and treatment plan in August 2003. This plan set ambitious targets, including a target of 53,000 people on treatment by the end of March 2005. By the end of 2004, this figure was surpassed, with 20,000 people on treatment at 50 public sector facilities and an estimated 45,000 in the private sector. Uptake of voluntary counselling and testing services has more than doubled since the launch of the programme.It is widely acknowledged that given the scale of the problem in South Africa, the key challenge for the HIV-AIDS programme and the comprehensive plan is to accelerate the pace of implementation. Lack of human resource capacity in most provinces has been a severe constraint. The slow pace of implementation has been a source of tension between the Government and civil society.Ireland has provided funding assistance to the struggle against HIV-AIDS in South Africa since 1995. Our funding for the period 2004 to 2006 will be more than €6 million and is directed at preventing the spread of HIV and reducing its impact. The programme is implemented by the South African Government and civil society organisations. The programme spans a number of different activities including behaviour change programmes for young people; community outreach programmes to build skills of marginalised young men and women; provision of home-based care for those terminally ill patients with AIDS; training of health workers in AIDS treatment and care; support for children orphaned by AIDS and support to provincial and district health offices for the delivery of HIV services.We will continue to work with the Government of South Africa and civil society partners to ensure a co-ordinated, accelerated and more focused response to the HIV-AIDS pandemic which prioritises prevention, particularly among young men and women and addresses the underlying causes of the spread of the pandemic, which are poverty, gender inequality and social exclusion.

This action was in breach of the Paris Agreement signed by Iran and the EU3, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in November 2004. Under this agreement, Iran, inter alia, reaffirmed that it did not and would not seek to acquire nuclear weapons and committed itself to full transparency and co-operation with the IAEA. Iran, moreover, decided voluntarily to suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities and to invite the IAEA to verify and to monitor the suspension. In return the EU3 agreed to commence negotiations, with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement on long-term arrangements in the areas of political and security issues, technology and co-operation and nuclear issues.At the board of governors meeting at the IAEA last month the EU3 co-sponsored a resolution that found Iran to be non-compliant with the agency's statute and reserved the right to refer Iran to the UN Security Council at a future date. Iran has been urged, inter alia, to re-establish full and sustained suspension of uranium conversion and to implement transparency measures, including providing IAEA officials with access to documentation relating to its nuclear programme and also of access to facilities. The resolution also requested the director general of the IAEA to continue his efforts to implement the resolution and previous resolutions and to report back to the board of governors on any developments on issues raised in his September report. On the basis of this future report the board of governors will decide on what further action should be taken with regard to Iran.The General Affairs and External Relations Council noted earlier this week that the resolution had given Iran the opportunity, through its actions, to influence the international community's next steps and urged Iran to take this opportunity by implementing all the measures requested by the IAEA board. Furthermore, the Council reaffirmed its support for a diplomatic solution and resumption of negotiations within the framework in the Paris Agreement. The Council agreed that such a solution would help create the climate for a better relationship with Europe and the international community as a whole. As I made clear in my statement to the United Nations General Assembly on 19 September, Ireland is fully supportive of the leadership of the EU3 in this matter.

That many of us had hoped that this positive development would have occurred sooner does not detract from its significance. We now look forward to confirmation by the Independent Monitoring Commission, in its reports scheduled for October and January, that all paramilitary and criminal activity by the IRA has finished.We also look forward to, and emphasise the importance of, the placing of arms beyond use by loyalist paramilitaries. In this regard, the IICD report stated last week that its work will not have been completed until the issue of loyalist arms, as well as arms in the possession of other paramilitary groups is dealt with. All who are in a position to encourage this process should take every opportunity to do so.The Deputy will be aware that representatives of the UVF and the UFF have had discussions in the past with the IICD with regard to the modalities of decommissioning. The IICD reported that the LVF decommissioned a quantity of arms in December 1998. The organisations in question have repeatedly stated that they could only fully address the issue of arms in a context of reciprocation from the IRA. Taken together, the IRA statement of 28 July and the decommissioning process completed last week now place a heavy responsibility on the various loyalist groups to put their arms beyond use.

Our concerns were conveyed directly to the US authorities. The Taoiseach raised the issue with President Bush at the EU-US summit at Dromoland Castle in June 2004, during Ireland's Presidency of the EU. Once the situation became clear, the US authorities committed themselves to ending the abuse of prisoners in Iraq and to bringing the perpetrators to justice. In keeping with that commitment, a number of US service personnel have been convicted and sentenced by military courts. If any further evidence of abuse comes to light, I would expect that similar action will result. I would not wish to comment on the individual cases of persons charged in these incidents.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	525	The 14th report of the Oversight Commissioner documents the solid progress that has been made towards the full implementation of the Patten report. Some 65% of the Patten recommendations have been fully implemented. The oversight commissioner praises the efforts made by the main institutions of policing in making a new beginning.Of crucial importance is the manner in which the reforms are making a real difference to the way policing is delivered locally. Complaints against the police have dropped by almost 20% in the past four years, with a corresponding drop in the proportion of complaints that relate to oppressive behaviour.The oversight commissioner's overall assessment is that the PSNI is now "one of the most overseen and accountable police agencies anywhere". The bulk of his criticism is towards a political system that has failed to provide the police with the appropriate context for community policing, whether because of a lack of support for the police in the case of Sinn Féin or because of failures of leadership which saw widespread loyalist rioting in September.The Government is conscious of widespread demand in Nationalist areas of Northern Ireland for effective, accountable policing. Support for policing is critical to ensuring an inclusive democracy in Northern Ireland in which all sections of society feel secure.In a number of his recent reports, the oversight commissioner has made clear his belief that the major obstacle to the full implantation of the Patten report is the refusal of all parties to take a full part in the institutions of policing and to support the police as it carries out its vital social function.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	526	The Government's programme of assistance to developing countries reflects our long-standing commitment to human rights and fairness in international relations and the recognition that democratisation, good governance and the promotion of human rights are as important as economic policy and reform for reducing poverty and achieving development.Support to good governance and democratisation is now a major priority area of expenditure in the development co-operation programme, accounting for more than €88 million in 2004. It includes assistance towards building democratic systems of government that are underpinned by free and fair elections; strengthening the rule of law, including legal and judicial systems, promoting access to justice by the poor; supporting the development of an objective and independent judiciary; public sector reform initiatives that help to build systems and ensure better quality of service delivery to the poor; enhancing respect for human rights by promoting the protection of fundamental rights, civil, political, social, economic and cultural; improving transparency and accountability through initiatives to enhance public financial management and audit systems; support for public watchdog institutions, parliamentary reform and the independent media; and building the capacity of civil society to influence and monitor public policy decisions.Last year, Development Co-operation Ireland supported pro-democracy initiatives in 17 countries worldwide in the areas of: support for NGO-based pro-democracy initiatives — four countries; support for election monitoring — nine countries; and support through the country programme budget of Development Co-operation Ireland in the priority programme countries — four countries.It is important to note that, whereas these programmes represent our main targeted expenditure in this area, the overall expenditure figure includes a proportion of the budgets allocated to our programme countries due to the cross-cutting importance of good governance and democratisation.Development Co-operation Ireland also gives funding to a number of locally based NGOs engaged in strengthening democratic systems. Examples of the type of programme supported include the following. In Sierra Leone, funds totalling €116,000 have been disbursed this year to support democratisation through the accountability in local government initiative which seeks to encourage citizens to take an active role in local development planning, local government meetings and the preparation and monitoring of budgets. This project is being implemented by the national accountability group of Sierra Leone, a civil society coalition of individuals and groups dedicated to increasing government accountability and curbing corruption in Sierra Leone and neighbouring countries.In Peru, a total of €314,342 has been allocated over the three years from 2004 to 2006 for a democratisation and reconciliation project. Ireland has joined together with other international donors to support this project which aims to contribute to the human development, democratisation and construction of a culture of peace in indigenous communities affected by the armed conflict in Peru.In 2004, expenditure on election monitoring amounted to €95,355 on nine missions, mobilising 43 election observers. In 2005 to date, there have been nine election monitoring missions: Albania, Afghanistan, Burundi, Ethiopia, FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia — FYROM, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia and Palestine. This has involved mobilising 32 short-term observers, STOs, and two long-term observers, LTOs, one to Ethiopia and one to Liberia. Preparations are under way for three further missions to Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Haiti, mobilising in the region of 14 to 16 further short-term observers. Expenditure in 2005 has been €70,945.Good governance is a key component in all of Development Co-operation Ireland's bilateral country programmes. For example, in Uganda, Ireland is providing support for the justice, law and order sector of €3 million in 2005, targeted at improving citizens' access to justice. In Tanzania, approximately €4 million has been allocated this year in support of governance initiatives while in Mozambique we provide €3 million to good governance and public sector reform. In Timor-Leste, East Timor, support totalling almost €450,000 in 2004 has been provided for the creation of the institutions of government and the establishment of the legislative and regulatory framework. In the case of Development Co-operation Ireland's new country programme in Vietnam, it is envisaged that support will be provided to strengthen the capacity of the national assembly in the oversight of government in the interests of increasing transparency and accountability and to facilitate democracy.

For the period referred to by the Deputy, I held meetings in that capacity with the Foreign Ministers of Belarus, Hungary, Estonia, Jordan, Malta, Iceland, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Israel, Palestinian Authority, Finland, France, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Greece, Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus. During this time I also met the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and with the then President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Jean Ping.In addition to my role as envoy of the UN Secretary General, I also took part in the following bilateral meetings. On 7 July I met Mr. Peter Hain, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Our discussion focused on the way ahead for the peace process and political and security issues, including the upcoming marching season and parades. I had a further meeting with Mr. Hain on 21 September where we reviewed developments over the summer, including the IRA statement of 28 July. We also discussed the regrettable recent upsurge in loyalist violence and other relevant political and security issues.On 15 September, en marge of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, I had a series of bilateral meetings with the Foreign Ministers of Turkey, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and Burundi. During my meeting with Foreign Minister Gul of Turkey, we discussed issues relating to Turkey’s EU accession discussions. My meetings with the Foreign Ministers of Egypt and the Palestinian Authority included an exchange of views on matters of mutual concern, including the continuing efforts of the international community to advance the progress of a just and lasting solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. I raised the matter of the ongoing investigation into the murder of Archbishop Michael Courtney in December 2003 and the Great Lakes conference process with my Burundian colleague, Ms Antoinette Batumubwira. In turn, the Burundian Foreign Minister requested support for her Government’s initiatives in the areas of primary and vocational education.On 19 September, also en marge of the United Nations General Assembly, I met the Foreign Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, Sudan and Colombia. During my meeting with Mr. Raymond Ramazani Baya, Foreign Minister of the DRC, we discussed the security situation in the DRC, the preparations for next year’s elections and the current state of bilateral relations between our two countries. I also informed my DRC colleague that Ireland will contribute €500,000 to the electoral process.Acting Foreign Minister of Sudan, Mr. Mustafa Osman Ismail, and I discussed the current situation in Sudan and the ongoing political and humanitarian crisis in Darfur. Minister Ismail briefed me in detail on his Government's views, offering a positive assessment of the humanitarian situation in Darfur and the general political and security situation in Sudan, including the state of play at the Abuja talks which are aimed at achieving a political settlement in Darfur.Discussions with the Colombian Foreign Minister, Ms Carolina Barco, focused on the new Colombian Justice and Peace Law and the issue of the Colombia Three.Also during the period in question, I would have had informal discussions with my EU colleagues during the course of meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, the European Council and the informal Foreign Ministers' meeting, Gymnich.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I am conscious of the importance of addressing all aspects of the terrorist threat. My European Union colleagues and I regularly review developments in the area of emergency planning.The EU plan of action on combating terrorism addresses all aspects of the European Union's action against terrorism, including emergency planning. The plan of action was adopted in December 2001 in the follow up to the terrorist attacks against the United States. It has been revised several times since, notably under the Irish Presidency in June 2004 in response to the Madrid bombings. One of the principal objectives of the plan of action is to enhance the capability of the European Union and of member states to deal with the consequences of terrorist attacks. The plan addresses in detail issues such as risk analysis, identification of threats, preparedness and consequence management, research and development and international co-operation.Much of the detailed implementation of the plan of action in relation to emergency planning falls under the responsibility of other ministers, but both the General Affairs and External Relations Council and the European Council comprehensively review progress towards implementation of the plan of action every six months. I have taken part in two such reviews, conducted in December 2004 and June 2005.Work under way in the EU on the issue of responding effectively to natural and humanitarian disasters is also relevant as the needs will often be similar. This issue has been a particular focus of European Union deliberations since last December's Asian tsunami disaster. The main challenge for the EU is to ensure that it is able to respond rapidly and flexibly. Whether this should be done through improving mechanisms that already exist, such as the mechanism for civil protection or European security and defence policy, ESDP, civilian capabilities, or through creating a new rapid response structure, is a matter under discussion among member states.Ireland has consistently supported the development of the EU's civilian capabilities to respond to crisis situations, both in respect of natural disasters such as the Asian tsunami and in the context of conflict and post conflict scenarios. We have committed civilian resources through both the mechanism for civil protection and, more broadly, through the civilian capabilities commitment process under the ESDP. These resources range from police capabilities to rule of law experts to civil protection personnel.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	529	In the 18 months since former President Bertrand Aristide resigned and left Haiti in February 2004, the political situation in the country has remained volatile and insecure. The transitional government led by Prime Minister Gerard Latortue has had very limited success in stabilising the security situation in the country and the Haitian national police continues to struggle to maintain law and order.With the help of the international community, the transitional Government has been working towards holding free and fair elections. The transitional Government intends to conduct the elections in two phases later this year, first holding local elections and subsequently holding parliamentary and presidential elections with a view to having a democratically elected Haitian government in place by February 2006. However, there is no confirmed date for the elections. There has, however, been good progress on election registration, with approximately 75% of possible voters now registered.The United Nations mission in Haiti, MINUSTAH, led by Brazil, is working with local authorities to launch civic education programmes to prepare for the elections and is co-operating in demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration efforts. It is also playing an important role in combating urban armed gangs which continue to pose a major barrier to security in the slums of Haiti's cities. In June 2005, the Security Council extended the mission in Haiti until February 2006 and approved a temporary increase in its strength to provide increased security in advance of the elections. The Security Council also urged the Haitian authorities to increase and accelerate efforts to prepare for and ensure the smooth conduct of the elections and called on international donors to provide the necessary resources to support the election process.The EU is also actively involved in efforts to restore democracy to Haiti. At an EU-Latin American ministerial meeting which I attended in Luxembourg on 27 May 2005, the importance of comprehensive long-term aid to enable the Haitian people to work towards the establishment of a violence-free inclusive democratic system was acknowledged. The EU pledged €294 million for comprehensive development projects in the country at the Washington donor conference for Haiti which took place in July 2004. Furthermore, the European Commission recently undertook an exploratory mission to Haiti to examine whether an EU election observation mission would be possible. The EuropeAid Co-operation Office is seeking nominations for long and short-term observers.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Each year more than 500,000 women die as a result of complications associated with pregnancy or giving birth, 95% of which deaths occur in Africa and Asia with less than 1% occurring in more developed countries. Many millions of women who survive childbirth suffer illness and disability afterwards.The reduction of maternal mortality is one of the key targets of the millennium declaration. While progress towards this goal has been very slow in low income countries, there is a growing recognition that improvements in maternal health will only be brought about if there is progress also in other goals relating to the health of women, such as better access to education, addressing gender inequalities and preventing the spread of HIV-AIDS.At the international conference on population and development, ICPD, in 1994, and its five year follow up, ICPD+5, governments committed themselves to provide universal access to reproductive health services to all individuals no later than 2015. The conference was ground breaking in placing population issues, including reproductive health and rights at the centre of human development.Ireland is fully committed to upholding the principles agreed at Cairo. We firmly believe that the ICPD programme of action is essential to achieving the millennium declaration development goals and to improving the health of mothers in poorer countries. We have translated this commitment into concrete actions by the financial support we provide for improving maternal health in developing countries.Ireland is playing a major role in supporting the strengthening of health systems in countries such as Uganda, Mozambique and Tanzania. In doing so, Ireland is helping to improve the quality of health services to enable women to access antenatal care and to receive emergency treatment in the event of a complication during pregnancy. In addition, in countries such as Zambia and Ethiopia, Ireland has provided specific funding for the improvement of maternity services at district and provincial level.The control of HIV-AIDS is closely linked to improvements in maternal health. Ireland provides substantial funding for programmes that prevent new infections among women, provide treatment for women infected by the disease and prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy. Total funding for HIV-AIDS programmes in 2005 amounts to €50 million. At the millennium summit high level event in New York last month, the Taoiseach announced that funding for HIV-AIDS activities would be substantially increased in the years ahead.In the context of a rapidly expanding aid programme and recognising the importance of the life and health of women to development progress, Ireland will continue to play a very active role in supporting these programmes and in ensuring the reduction of maternal mortality in developing countries remains an important policy objective.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	531	A thorough review of departmental practice with regard to the use of the diplomatic bag for the transmission of correspondence to officers serving abroad was carried out by officials in my Department in late 2004 and early 2005. This included consideration of the practices in other countries. The review arose from the distribution on one occasion of generic election material to a number of overseas officers of the Department. Under the terms of the Electoral Acts, and subject to registration in the appropriate manner, civil servants serving at Irish diplomatic and consular missions overseas, together with qualifying members of their families resident with them, are entitled to cast their ballots by post.It is the Department's practice to allow officers serving abroad and members of their families residing with them to use the diplomatic bag facility to send and receive items of private correspondence. At election time, it has also been the practice to forward to officers abroad, who are registered voters, personally addressed election literature received in the Department. Concern was expressed in May 2004, prior to the local and European elections, about the transmission of certain generic election material in the diplomatic bag which was not specifically addressed to individuals. Neither the then Minister, his private office, nor any senior official were aware of the request to circulate this material. In the light of the understandable concerns arising from this, the then Minister informed the Dáil that the Department's arrangements now needed to be put on a more structured basis and that a review would be conducted for that purpose. The Minister assured the Dáil that the new arrangements would ensure that the process was fully transparent and would be known to interested parties at election time.Arising from the review, the Department has now drawn up a set of draft procedures to govern the distribution of election material through the diplomatic bag and to ensure that there is no repetition of the type of transmission mentioned above. These would require political parties that wished to send election material to registered postal voters in embassies or consulates to make specific arrangements for the delivery of such literature in separate individually addressed envelopes to a named official in the Department's registry. I will ensure that the new structured arrangements are made known to all concerned well in advance of the next election.

He is working with the parties to finalise an action plan for the economic revitalisation of Gaza following the withdrawal of Israeli settlers and troops. He is also working to broker agreement on a border regime for Gaza and to ensure effective arrangements for the movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza.The special envoy hopes to present a three-year plan for the revitalisation of Gaza to the G8 in the coming weeks with a view to raising international support for implementation starting in 2006. The Government will play its part in this important work in co-operation with our partners in the EU. Ireland is already committed to a wide range of development projects in co-operation with the Palestinian Authority. I have made it clear, including at my meetings in recent months with President Abbas and others of the Palestinian Authority, that the Government is ready to increase its assistance in the light of the special envoy's plan and the identification of needs and priorities for the period ahead.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	533	As I set out in my replies to Questions Nos. 603 of 28 September 2005 and 616 of 28 September 2005, I am aware of a recent media report that Martin Scheinin, the UN Commission on Human Rights special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, has been contacted by Irish citizens regarding allegations about the use of Irish airports by the US to transit prisoners who are suspected of terrorist activity. I repeat that two weeks ago my Department was contacted by Professor Scheinin's office to confirm that neither he, nor any other special rapporteur, is investigating or inquiring into this matter. As regards the wider issue raised by the Deputy, I refer him to my reply today to Question No. 3 from Deputy Gormley.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	534	To date, action plans under the European neighbourhood policy, ENP, have been agreed with Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine. Discussions on action plans with Egypt and Lebanon are continuing. It is hoped that it may be possible to conclude these before the end of 2005 but this depends on progress. The General Affairs and External Relations Council in April authorised the Commission to work jointly with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to prepare action plans. This work is also in hand.In October 2004, the Commission presented a proposal for a dedicated financial instrument, the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument, ENPI, to replace existing European Community assistance programmes for the countries and regions covered by the ENP. The ENPI is part of a series of proposals for financial instruments to support the EU's external relations for the budgetary period 2007 to 2013 which the Commission has submitted to Council and Parliament. The aim of the Commission's proposals is to simplify the delivery of assistance, facilitate coherence and consistency of external actions and achieve better and more with the resources available. These proposals remain under discussion and have yet to be fully agreed.The ENPI should provide increased and more targeted financial assistance in the future. It will have a specific focus on cross-border and intra-regional co-operation. All countries covered by the ENP, as well as Russia, will be eligible for support under this instrument.Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has described 2005 as the "year of delivery" for the European neighbourhood policy, the challenge being to turn the commitments and aspirations contained in the action plans into reality, through measurable reforms bringing concrete benefits for the countries involved. Deputies will be aware that the ENP is designed to strengthen relations between the EU and those neighbouring countries that do not have the prospect of EU membership. The prospect of an increasingly close relationship with the EU, involving a significant degree of economic integration and a deepening of political co-operation, is offered to these countries in return for concrete progress in the implementation of political, economic and institutional reforms reflecting shared values.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	535	Sierra Leone has made major progress in the restoration of peace since the end of the civil war in 2002. The overall security situation is generally calm and stable. Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for 2007. However, serious challenges remain, not least because of limited progress towards addressing the root causes of conflict such as corruption, weaknesses in governance, and poverty. Sierra Leone is also affected by the fragile political situation in the sub-region, especially in Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia.The Government of Sierra Leone, with the support of the UN mission in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL, is gradually assuming full responsibility for the maintenance of security through the build-up of the national armed forces and police. This process is due to be completed by end December 2005 when the residual UNAMSIL presence will be withdrawn. However, the security forces face considerable logistical constraints and Sierra Leone will require continued international support for the security sector in the future.UNAMSIL will be replaced in January 2006 by the United Nations integrated office in Sierra Leone, UNIOSIL, which will assist the Government to develop and implement a strategy for addressing the root causes of the conflict and accelerating progress towards the millennium development goals; to build the capacity of the National Electoral Commission to conduct a free, fair and credible electoral process in 2007; and to strengthen the security sector. Sierra Leone's long-term development needs will also be addressed at a major donors' meeting to be held in London in November 2005.The human rights situation in Sierra Leone is improving. Work is under way on the establishment of a human rights commission to which the UN Commissioner on Human Rights has offered technical assistance. The final report of the truth and reconciliation commission has been published and UNAMSIL distributed its findings throughout the country in August 2005. The Government subsequently published a White Paper which reflected most of the Commission's recommendations, but implementation has not yet begun. Both the judicial sector and civil society remain weak.Poverty is a major problem in Sierra Leone and more than 70% of the population live on less than US$1 per day. GDP grew by 7.4% in 2004, supported by improvements in agriculture, mining, construction, manufacture and services. However, the business environment is still fragile, which hampers private sector growth. Major progress has been made in the diamond mining sector, particularly in the area of licensing, which has resulted in a substantial increase in official exports of diamonds. These totalled US$127 million in 2004 and US$82 million in the first half of 2005. Earlier this year, Ireland established a development co-operation office in Freetown. Funding of more than €1.75 million has already been allocated to Sierra Leone in 2005 and further support is under active consideration.The Sierra Leone Special Court was established in 2002 to bring to trial "those who bear greatest responsibility" for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Sierra Leone after 30 November 1996. Currently, 11 persons associated with all three of the country's former warring factions stand indicted by the special court. Ireland has been a strong supporter of the court since its establishment in 2002 and has contributed more than €1 million to it. This includes €300,000 for 2005 to 2006 pledged on 30 September 2005.

The database incorporates three basic elements of information: demographic details, current service provision and future service requirements. Information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.The national intellectual disability database enables those involved with the planning and delivery of services to people with an intellectual disability and those with autism to identify not only the level of need among those awaiting placement in services but also the service changes required by those already in receipt of services.

The EHIC entitles the holder to necessary health care in the public system of any of these countries, if he or she becomes ill or injured during a temporary stay in that country. It does not cover the cost of planned treatment or treatment in a private setting. As public health care systems vary from country to country, with few countries providing treatment completely free of charge to cardholders, and as the EHIC does not cover the cost of repatriation, and as illness or an accident abroad may mean extra travel and accommodation costs, those travelling abroad may wish to consider taking out private health insurance in addition. The EHIC arrangements apply only in those countries mentioned above and do not apply in Jersey.

I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that An Bord Altranais must be rigorous in processing each application thoroughly and in a secure manner, ensuring that all those entered on the register of nurses are deemed professionally qualified and competent for such registration. The protection of the public underpins this process. I am satisfied that the board is most professional in its discharge of these functions. In 2004, over 3,500 newly registered qualifications were entered on the register.With regard to individual applications, decisions are normally issued to applicants within six weeks. However, errors or omissions in information supplied by the applicant, or by any other relevant agency or training college, will cause delays. It may be that reasons such as these will have contributed to any delay in the processing of the application.Given the statutory functions of the board, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in individual applications for registration.

However, a person aged 70 years and over may be charged for inpatient services, after the acute phase is completed up to a maximum of 80% of a weekly non-contributory old age pension depending on the individual circumstances under SI 76 of 2005 Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 subject to the provisions of section 53 of the Health Act 1970 as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005.The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 allows for the payment of a subvention towards the cost of private nursing home care based on a dependency and means assessment. The criteria used in determining a person's eligibility for subvention is set out in the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993. The subvention scheme was introduced to assist with the cost of private nursing home care and it was never intended that a subvention payment would meet the full costs of private nursing home care.

All those who were charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died more than six years prior to that date. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the consumer price index, since the time the person involved was charged.Legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible to provide a clear legal framework for the scheme. In the case of those who were charged and are still alive, the repayments will be exempt from tax and will not be taken into account in assessing means for health and social welfare benefits. The normal tax and means assessment arrangements will apply to those who benefit from repayments to estates.The legislation will include appropriate safeguards to prevent exploitation of those who receive repayments and are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs. The scheme will include a provision to allow those eligible for a repayment to waive their right to a repayment and have the money assigned to fund one-off service improvements in elderly, mental health and disability services.A national oversight committee has been appointed by the Tánaiste and has already begun its work. It will provide an independent input into the design of the scheme and to monitor the operation of the scheme in order to ensure that it is being implemented quickly and in the most equitable and effective way possible.The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified under the ex gratia payments process. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process.An outside organisation with experience in handling mass claims will be engaged by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to design and manage the scheme within the parameters of the key principles approved by Government. The organisation selected will work closely with the HSE to ensure that the necessary co-operation is forthcoming on records held by the health agencies. The HSE has received expressions of interest from a number of organisations and these have been shortlisted. It is anticipated that the successful organisation will be selected in November and will begin work on the design of the scheme.The national helpline set up by the HSE to allow people to register if they believe they are due a repayment will continue to operate but there is no need for anyone who has already registered using this facility to make contact with the HSE again to register for the scheme.The Deputy's question relates to a specific case that involves the management and delivery of health and personal social services and which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

The following is the position. Bin charges are allowable in the year following the year to which they relate and only if they are paid on time and in full. The bin charges paid by the person in 2005 were made up of €590.26 arrears and €40 for 2005. Only the €40 paid for 2005 is, therefore, allowable. This will be included in the person's tax credit certificate for 2006. In April 2004 a review was carried out in respect of the taxpayer's claim for dental expenses for the year 2003, however an underpayment of €155.26 arose. This underpayment mainly arose due to an insufficient amount coded through the person's tax credits to collect the tax due in respect of their income from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. An amended balancing statement for 2003 will issue shortly which will incorporate the relief due in respect of union subscriptions. The revised underpayment is now €111.62, and collection of this underpayment has been deferred for the moment. Relief for union subscriptions for the years 2004 and 2005 has already been granted in the person's tax credits for 2004 and 2005.The person also included a form TRS1, application for tax relief at source on mortgage interest, with her claim. She is already receiving tax relief at source in respect of her mortgage with the lending institution. The form TRS1 has been forwarded to the collector general's division to ensure that she is receiving the correct relief.

In providing consumer protection, the financial regulator can impose and enforce rules on financial services firms regarding how they deal with consumers, including how they sell financial products.The financial regulator has informed my Department that the financial regulator is only aware of one credit card provider that issues cheques drawing on individuals' credit card accounts. The credit card provider in question has advised the financial regulator that some customers have found this facility an effective means of making a payment where credit card facilities are not available for transferring a balance from another credit card or making a payment by post.The cheques in question are treated as a cash advance and as such may incur the higher rate of interest normally associated with cash transactions on credit cards. The interest is applied from the date that the cheque is presented for payment. This information is included in the letter accompanying the credit card cheques. The credit card provider has also informed the financial regulator that credit card cheques are not sent to customers who are over their credit limit or delinquent. The financial regulator is aware that if consumers apply for these types of credit card, the chequebook is a feature of the product.The financial regulator is continuing to monitor the provision of credit card cheques. My Department has been advised by the financial regulator that only a small number of consumer complaints have been received in relation to the service.The Deputy may wish to note that the financial regulator's draft consumer protection code has included the following provision "A regulated entity must give customers details of all charges and fees including third party charges which the regulated entity will pass on to the customer, prior to providing a service to the customer." There is also a provision that credit card limits may only be increased following a request from the customer.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	568	Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, which was established as a statutory agency in May 2002, implements a wide variety of programmes on energy efficiency and renewable energy on behalf of my Department.Under SEI's House of Tomorrow Research, HOT, development and demonstration programme, financial support is directed at encouraging developers of housing, both new-built and refurbishment, to incorporate design and technology features, which deliver significantly superior energy and CO2 performance. By targeting developers of schemes of houses, from the private or social housing sectors, the aim has been to establish over a number of years a nationwide network of accessible examples of more sustainable energy design and technology practices. Together with other promotional measures by SEI, this is intended to encourage a sufficient degree of market replication, without subsidy, to elevate energy performance standards across the wider housing stock. This targeted approach is also designed to be an administratively efficient method for deployment of public monies. To date, the programme has committed over €9 million funding to 48 projects comprising a total 2,269 housing units. All feature an integrated approach to design, orientation, building fabric and energy supply and use, that achieves performance at least 20% better than current building regulations and in the majority of projects, 40% better. The sustainable energy features across the range of projects funded include: solar hot water systems, ground source heat pumps, condensing boilers, group heating schemes and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery along with higher levels of insulation.The programme has been directed at suppliers and developers of housing, rather than individual householders. There have been two main reasons for this. First, House of Tomorrow is a research and development support scheme, not a home improvement grants scheme. It is seeking projects of sufficient scale and impact to influence wide application of the practices and technologies demonstrated. An effective way to achieve this is by means of clusters of homes that will provide regionally visible and accessible examples and which can be replicated. Overall, integrated developments are encouraged.Second, a key need in moving towards more energy efficient planning and construction practices in Irish homes is to develop the necessary awareness and capability within the construction industry. SEI, through its consumer awareness programmes, seeks to increase the demand for energy efficiency amongst homeowners and occupants. House of Tomorrow, as a research, development and demonstration programme, supports the development and demonstration of capability in the industry to deliver higher quality energy efficient homes to meet such a demand. The aim is to increase standards and practices across the industry as a whole.Regular reviews are conducted on all SEI's funding programmes. Factors entering any such consideration include the establishment of consumer product standards, supplier capability and installation quality assurance systems appropriate to consumer markets. This is in addition to the core requirements of energy and CO2 saving impact, market impact potential, administrative efficiency and ultimately, value for money for the taxpayer.Funding for SEI is determined on an annual basis. SEI submits a proposed work programme for the coming year along with a budget for each of its programmes, such as the House of Tomorrow programme, to my Department. Any increase in funding required for these programmes would have budgetary implications and could only be considered in the light of the overall budgetary requirements of SEI and the level of funding available to the Department.I am keen to see a wider take-up of energy-efficient technology in design, building and use of homes. While many of the measures involved are self-financing, with payback periods of as little as two or three years, I am looking at what incentives might be needed to improve the rate of take-up and use. Increasing the energy efficiency of our building stock reduces our energy imports, reduces our CO2 emissions and saves money for the individual household and for the Exchequer.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	569	: I refer the Deputy to my reply given to Parliamentary Question No. 325 on Tuesday, 4 October in respect of inaccurate reports about a particular parasite affecting salmon stocks. I am advised by the Marine Institute that in early September anglers had noticed that some salmon caught on the River Blackwater were infected with a parasite. Samples were analysed and the parasite was identified as Anisakis species. Anisakis is not uncommon.There can be no association between falling salmon numbers and the burden of Anisakis so far described. There is no history of high numbers in Irish salmon or of the capability of Anisakis to cause epidemics that might wipe out populations of fish. Indeed some authors describe Anisakis as being of little importance except for the human aspect.Nor does the occurrence of this parasite represent serious infectious pressure to the coarse fish population. Salmon can be intermediate hosts or occasionally final hosts for this parasite. In order for freshwater fish to become infected, they must eat returning salmon — or possibly flesh from dead salmon. If freshwater fish were to become infected, they would merely act as another intermediate host. The life cycle of the parasite would not be completed in these freshwater fish.Anglers who are concerned about any apparent parasitic infestations or diseases in fish should contact their local regional fisheries board staff, who will know who to contact and how best to collect and preserve fish for examination.

Of this, some €700,000 has been channelled to the American Red Cross through the Irish Red Cross. The remainder will be disbursed by the Irish Embassy in the United States with the objective of assisting civil society groups in the Gulf Coast area in the local recovery effort.Ireland, along with other EU member states, offered material assistance through the European Civil Protection Mechanism, which is the formal EU co-ordination mechanism for such assistance.The United States authorities have expressed warm appreciation for Ireland's assistance.

Tensions in the previous Government came to a head when Presidential Chief of Staff Oleksandr Zinchenko resigned on 3 September, making serious allegations of corruption about those around President Yushchenko, particularly National Security and Defence Council Secretary Petro Poroshenko. This made existing tensions within the Council of Ministers between Mr. Poroshenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko public. On 8 September the President dismissed Prime Minister Tymoshenko and the Council of Ministers.Reports suggest these difficulties are also to be seen in the context of positioning for the parliamentary elections due at the end of March 2006, which will be of critical importance for Ukraine's further development as a democracy and market economy. Mrs. Tymoshenko has been replaced as Prime Minister by Yuriy Yekhanurov who, on 22 September, was confirmed in that position by the Ukrainian Parliament. Mr. Borys Tarasiuk has been reappointed Foreign Minister. The work of the Government is now returning to normal, including in such areas of importance as legislation regarding Ukraine's entry to the World Trade Organisation. Ireland remains committed to working with Ukraine as it pursues the challenges of reform. The Ceann Comhairle is leading the first Oireachtas delegation to Ukraine. Following my visit to Ukraine in July, Foreign Minister Tarasiuk will visit Ireland later this month.

Food insecurity, starvation, conflict and HIV-AIDS appear at times to create an endless cycle of poverty and conflict. Addressing these issues is one of the most important tasks to which we can dedicate ourselves in the 21st century.The Government responds in two ways to the humanitarian and development needs of Africa. In the short term, we focus on saving lives in the most effective way possible, through direct assistance via the UN system and international agencies as well as non-governmental organisations — NGOs.Ireland's emergency humanitarian aid programme supports short-term interventions in the immediate aftermath of natural and man-made disasters. This humanitarian assistance is founded on the principles of international humanitarian law, a commitment to needs-based programming and regular evaluations of humanitarian operations. This approach ensures that the assistance is directed where needs are greatest. It is clear that the cycle of recurring emergencies in Africa needs to be broken if the affected populations are to progress towards the achievement of the UN millennium development goals — the halving of poverty — by 2015.In the longer term, Ireland's development programme tackles the structural reasons underlying endemic poverty. We have strong development partnerships with eight countries, six of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. Through these partnerships, Ireland fully engages with Governments, donors, civil society, local communities and aid agencies on the basis of poverty reduction strategy plans — PRSPs. PRSPs prioritise a country's resources and expenditures to reduce poverty, tackle HIV-AIDS, encourage economic growth and foster a culture of respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.Ireland's official programme of overseas development assistance has considerable built-in safeguards to oversee and monitor the utilisation of our funding resources. Our partner organisations have developed strong mechanisms to ensure that Ireland's official programme of overseas development assistance has considerable built-in safeguards to oversee and monitor the utilisation of our funding resources. Our partner organisations have developed strong mechanisms to ensure that assistance is provided to those most in need in a clear and transparent way. Our direct funding through local and national authorities is audited by the national auditing agencies, auditing firms of international repute, donor partners and my Department's audit and evaluation unit. As well as direct financial accountability, it is also important to ensure value for money and impact. Impact focused evaluations are also carried out by the audit and evaluation unit and independent experts.In the context of increased levels of funding, it is clear that we will need to ensure that delivery mechanisms are appropriate and effective. This is clearly in the interests of all stakeholders, including Governments, donor countries, NGOs, aid agencies and, most important of all, the vulnerable people to whom all our efforts are directed. The Taoiseach was clear on the importance of accountability when he recently addressed the UN General Assembly, stating that "to ensure that public support for aid remains strong, we must work with developing countries to improve governance, promote human rights, increase transparency and stamp out corruption".
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	576	At their meeting in Gleneagles in July, the G8 countries agreed on an initiative for the cancellation of debt owed to the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the IMF. The scheme will provide for the cancellation of debt for 18 heavily indebted poor countries — HIPCs.The G8 initiative has been welcomed by Ministers meeting in the development committee ministerial meetings of the World Bank and the IMF. Ireland views it as an important recognition of the need for further significant reductions in the debt burdens of HIPCs. The Minister for Finance has indicated that Ireland will be prepared to pay its share of the costs of the scheme.Ireland's official policy, adopted in 2002, calls for debt cancellation for all HIPCs and we will continue to work towards that end. We also hold the view that a country's obligation to repay debt must not prevent it from maintaining an adequate level of expenditure on services and investments in health, education, agriculture, water supply, sanitation, roads and other infrastructure. Without adequate resources for these areas, development and poverty reduction are impossible. I am glad that the G8 countries have come to the same conclusion. The objective of debt cancellation is to free up additional resources which can be devoted to working towards the millennium development goals of eradicating extreme poverty, achieving universal primary education, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, etc. In this regard, Ireland intends to contribute €70 million to the IDA 14th replenishment to help ensure sufficient funding for loans and grants to less-developed countries. At the same time, it is clear that if borrowing by low-income countries is to be maintained at sustainable levels in the longer term, significant increases in ODA will be required, particularly by the larger economies.With regard to the above, I take this opportunity to pay my own personal tribute to Bob Geldof and the DATA campaigners for their work in pushing debt issues at a global level.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	577	The United Nations has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. The EU enlargement process provided the impetus for the most recent efforts towards a settlement, which were undertaken by the UN Secretary General in the first half of 2004, during Ireland's EU Presidency. Ireland, as President of the EU, maintained close contact with the various parties concerned, in order to encourage their commitment to the negotiating process and to the achievement of an agreed outcome.As a result of the referendums in Cyprus on 24 April 2004 the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus on 1 May 2004 was not possible. Since 1 May 2004 the Republic of Cyprus has been a member state of the EU and in the absence of a comprehensive settlement, the application of the laws and regulations of the Union to the northern part of the island is suspended.The matter has remained under consideration at the United Nations. In May of this year, following discussions with UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, the President of Cyprus, Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, sent an envoy to New York for preliminary informal talks with senior officials in the UN secretariat. As a result of these discussions, the Secretary General asked Mr. Kieran Prendergast, the Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs, to travel to Cyprus, Athens and Ankara to listen to the views of all parties on the future of the mission of good offices on Cyprus.In June, Mr. Prendergast reported to the Security Council that despite certain positive elements, the gap between the stated positions of the parties on substance appeared to be wide. The Secretary General and United Nations officials continue to monitor the situation closely. The Government has strongly supported Secretary General Annan in his mission of good offices.With regard to the EU enlargement process, on 29 July of this year, as part of the preparations for the opening of its accession negotiations and in accordance with the conclusions of the December 2004 European Council, Turkey signed the Ankara Agreement Protocol to take account of the accession of the new member states, including the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey also issued a declaration stating that its signature, ratification and implementation of the protocol did not amount to recognition of the Republic of Cyprus referred to in the protocol. In response, on 21 September, the EU agreed and issued a counter-declaration recalling the status of the Republic of Cyprus as a member state of the EU. The counter-declaration also noted that recognition of all member states is a necessary component of the accession process and underlined the importance the Union attaches to the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all member states as soon as possible. The EU negotiating framework for the Turkish accession negotiations, which opened on 3 October, reiterated the importance of progress in the normalisation of bilateral relations between Turkey and all member states, including the Republic of Cyprus.In the context of the counter-declaration, the EU and its member states also agreed on the importance of supporting the efforts of the UN Secretary General and that a just and lasting settlement would contribute to peace, stability and harmonious relations in the region.The Government, together with our EU partners, remains ready to accommodate a settlement of the Cyprus problem based on the Secretary General's proposals and in line with the principles on which the Union is founded.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	578	On Monday the General Affairs and External Relations Council approved a framework for negotiations with Turkey on its accession to the EU, enabling the accession negotiations to open shortly thereafter. I very much welcome this development.Turkey has been a candidate for membership of the EU since the Helsinki European Council in December 1999 which agreed that it was destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria applied to the other candidate states. The European Council in Brussels on 16-17 December 2004 decided, on the basis of the Commission's report and recommendation, that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria to enable the opening of accession negotiations. The Council therefore requested the Commission to begin work on a proposal for a negotiating framework and to present it to the Council, with a view to the opening of the accession negotiations on 3 October.The shared objective of the negotiations is accession. It will be an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed in advance. The negotiations will be based on Turkey's own merits and the pace will depend on the country's progress in meeting requirements for membership. Given the financial consequences of Turkish accession, the framework makes clear that negotiations can only be concluded after the establishment of the financial framework for the period from 2014 together with possible consequential financial reforms. Throughout the negotiations, the Union will expect Turkey to sustain the process of reform which it has already begun, and to work towards further improvements including in respect of the principles of liberty, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Parallel to the negotiations, the Union will also engage with Turkey in an intensive political and civil society dialogue with the aim of enhancing mutual understanding.The EU has taken a lead role in working with the countries of the western Balkans to consolidate peace and stability in the region, and to promote economic development and respect for human rights and the rule of law. The EU-Western Balkans Summit, which was held in Thessaloniki in June 2003, agreed a shared agenda for progress towards the objective of the eventual integration of the countries of the region into EU structures.In this context, I very much welcome that this week's Council gave the go-ahead to accession negotiations with Croatia, on the basis of a positive assessment of Croatia's co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia — ICTY — and that the accession negotiations opened on 4 October.I also welcome this week's Council decision to authorise the Commission to open negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia and Montenegro. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia lodged its application for EU membership under the Irish EU Presidency in June 2004. The Commission opinion on the application is expected in November. This autumn the EU Commission is expected to issue its regular report on the stabilisation and association process in Albania. Negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina will take place as soon as the relevant conditions relating to police reform have been met.

Section 21 of that Act deals exclusively with national metrology functions and defines the legal basis and locus of responsibility for functions related to all metrology in the State. Subsequently responsibility for metrology was transferred from Forbairt to the NSAI by virtue of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998. Section 51 of this Act also gave specific responsibility to NSAI "to promote the use and application of metrology in the State". The NSAI, therefore, has legislative responsibility for all metrology in the State.The metrology laboratory is located on the Enterprise Ireland campus in Glasnevin. The laboratory carries out functions on behalf of the National Standards Authority of Ireland — NSAI — through its staff who are Forfás staff seconded to Enterprise Ireland. Enterprise Ireland has been providing the necessary resources to NSAI, since 1998, through its staff working in the metrology laboratory, the cost of which is borne by NSAI.It will be clear to the Deputy that the Oireachtas has already determined where responsibility for metrology functions lies, namely the NSAI. While the functions in this regard have been transferred, the budgetary arrangements supporting the activities of the laboratory, the transfer of ownership of the laboratory infrastructure and the regularisation of the position of staff working in the laboratory required further consideration. I advise the Deputy that the budgetary arrangements are now in place and that I expect the transfer of ownership of the laboratory to NSAI to take place shortly. On the single remaining issue discussions are taking place between my Department, management of the State agencies involved and staff representatives to regularise the position of the staff working in the laboratory.

This figure includes the cost of land acquisition. The construction of a minor estate access road and associated landscaping, costing approximately €200,000, have recently been completed.The next stage of the project will be the building of advance technology units. The park will initially accommodate four units — two 5,000 sq. ft. units and two units of 7,500 sq. ft. — for which planning permission has been obtained from Galway County Council.Planning permission is also currently being sought for a new advance technology building on a site adjacent to the park entrance. This 20,000 sq. ft. building will be designed to accommodate manufacturing-type operations but can also be converted to office based activity, if required.I understand that the park is actively being marketed to potential overseas investors by IDA Ireland through its network of overseas offices and project divisions. I have no doubt that the availability of the flagship park together with the planned associated buildings will enhance the attractiveness of the area to potential overseas investors. I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Tuam.

A qualified adult increase at the maximum rate is payable where the spouse/partner's income is €88.88 per week or less and tapered reduced rates are payable where income is less than €220 per week. The lower threshold was last increased in budget 2000 while the upper threshold has been increased in each successive budget since then, from £135 in 2000 to €220 in budget 2005.The position is being reviewed but any change in the current arrangements relating to entitlement to qualified adult allowances would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	583	The person concerned is an adult dependant on her husband's retirement pension. A reduced rate of increase for an adult dependant, IQA, is payable as the person is engaged in part-time work with a weekly income in excess of €88.88 per week, but less than €220.One of the key objectives of the 2005 social welfare budget package was to protect and enhance the real value of all rates of payment. Budget 2005 provided for increases in the main personal rates of weekly payments ranging from 8.4% to 13.1% with the same percentage IQA increases. Similarly, the main rates of IQA were also increased by the same percentages thereby ensuring that they did not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate.Since the year 2000 the rate of IQA on retirement pension has increased by 53.6% or €43.06, while the consumer price index has risen by 18.8%. Similarly, since 1995, the rate of IQA has increased by 108.2% or €62.11 while the consumer price index has risen by 31.5%. This has given real increases of 29.3% and 8.2%, respectively.For the purposes of most social welfare payments, entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult is based on the income of the spouse or partner, An increase at the maximum rate is payable where the spouse-partner's income is €88.88 per week or less and tapered reduced rates are payable where income is between €88.88 and €220 per week. The lower threshold was last increased in budget 2000 while the upper threshold has been increased in each successive budget since then from €171.41 or £135 in 2000 to €220 in budget 2005.When an adult dependant reaches age 65 or 66 he or she may qualify, respectively, for retirement pension or old age contributory pension in his or her own right, provided the contribution conditions are satisfied. If there is no entitlement to a pension or only a reduced entitlement which is lower than the adult dependant increase, the claimant can continue to claim the higher adult dependant increase.Any change in the current arrangement relating to entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.

The scheme is payable, subject to certain conditions, to people who have been in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment or who had participated in community employment. The specified qualifying social welfare payment types are farm assist, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, disability allowance and the FÁS community employment scheme.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has advised that fuel allowance payments will be made through the rural social scheme for participants who had an entitlement to fuel allowance previously under their relevant social welfare or employment scheme.In general, people in receipt of short-term payments such as unemployment benefit-assistance or disability benefit do not qualify for a fuel allowance under the social welfare code. Any change in current arrangements would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.Information on the numbers of persons in receipt of the rural social scheme who are ineligible for fuel allowance is not readily available in my Department. Any issues specific to entitlement or qualifying criteria under the rural social scheme are a matter for consideration by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the first instance.

Neither I nor my Department has any function in relation to decisions on individual claims.With effect from 1 May 2004, this scheme and other social assistance payments are subject to a statutory habitual residence test. An applicant whose habitual residence or "centre of interest" is deemed to be other than in this State or the common travel area has no entitlement to social assistance.The Dublin-mid-Leinster area of the Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned had been in receipt of a reduced rate of supplementary welfare allowance for herself or her child, at a rate equivalent to that payable in the direct provision accommodation in which she had resided previously through the Reception and Integration Agency.The HSE has further advised that it became aware subsequently that the person concerned had been in the United Kingdom for some time and had returned to this State. Following further review of her entitlements based on this information, the HSE determined that she no longer qualified for supplementary welfare allowance on habitual residence grounds. Her payment was terminated accordingly and she was referred to the Reception and Integration Agency so that her accommodation and other needs could be met.It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision to the appeals officer in the relevant Health Service Executive area and, if necessary, then to the social welfare appeals office.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	591	As I indicated in response to Question No. 809 of 28 September 2005, the traffic signs manual sets out the directions and advice given to road authorities by the Minister for Transport pursuant to section 95(16) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 regarding the provision and use of warning and information traffic signs. A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library. Chapter 8 of the manual contains advice on the signs to be deployed at road works. Responsibility for the provision, positioning, maintenance and monitoring of such traffic signs at road works locations on non-national roads is a matter for individual road authority and in the case of national roads, the National Roads Authority. The Department of Transport has been engaged in a comprehensive review of the traffic signs manual since late 2004, in association with the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Consultants have been engaged to prepare a new manual. It is intended that the use of the manual by road authorities will ensure a high quality of signposting in the State through uniformity of practice and the creation of a consistent approach to signing, including at road works.Section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 provides that a county or city manager may make a road works speed limit order for the application of a speed limit on any road or part of a road, including a motorway, where road works are being carried out. A road works speed limit order can be applied for any period of not more than 12 months and the minimum speed limit that may be put in place by such an order is 30 km/h. This provision of the 2004 Act came into operation in January 2005. Before making an order under section 10, a county or city manager must give notice of the proposal to the Garda Commissioner and consider any representations made by the Commissioner. The consent of the National Roads Authority must be obtained in respect of any proposals to apply a road works speed limit on any part of a national road or a motorway. Notice of the making of a road works speed limit order must be published in one or more newspapers in circulation in the county or city where the road in respect of which the order is to have effect is located.Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 provides for the application, by means of the making of by-laws by the elected members of local authorities, of special speed limits in lieu of the speed limits which apply on a default basis to roads and motorways. The section also provides that the Minister for Transport may issue guidelines to county and city councils on the making of special speed limit by-laws. I issued such guidelines on 18 April 2005 and they include a specific reference to the deployment of speed limits at road works. A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library and may also be viewed on the Department of Transport's website, www.transport.ie, under the heading of roads — publications. The determination of the speed limit that should apply at particular locations in lieu of a default speed limit is a matter for the elected members of local authorities in the case of special speed limit by-laws and for county and city managers in the case of road works speed limit orders.The National Roads Authority has published a detailed list of guideline and information documents on various aspects of road maintenance on its website, www.nra.ie, under the heading of road design and construction — publications and resources. Further technical guidance and publications are provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on its website, www.environ.ie, under the heading of roads division — publications.

I understand from the authority that a study of an eastern bypass of Dublin city, which was conducted in 2002, indicated that the cost, based on this preliminary analysis, would be at least €1.4 billion in January 2002 prices. The estimate was qualified as being an initial estimate — broad assumptions were made about land costs. It specifically excluded the cost of necessary special environmental protection measures, the cost consequences of the EU tunnel directive and the costs of the constraints on construction efficiency due to residential proximity and traffic management needs.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	593	In March 2002, the Railway Procurement Agency was given statutory responsibility, under SI No. 84 of 2002, for the delivery of a multi-operator system of integrated ticketing. A subsequent departmental mandate to the agency set out the policy context. The proposed contactless smartcard-based integrated ticketing system will enable a passenger to use a ticket on one or more scheduled public transport services, by road and by rail, irrespective of the transport operator involved. It will be introduced on a phased basis, initially in the Dublin area. Pursuant to the departmental mandate, a project plan for a contactless smartcard-based integrated ticketing system was agreed with the agency. The project plan for the delivery of integrated ticketing consists of four key distinct phases. The first phase, the economic evaluation of the project, has been completed. The second phase, the definition of the integrated ticketing system, incorporating design, has been carried out in consultation with the stakeholders and the public. The third phase, the procurement process, commenced in 2004. The target dates for the implementation of the fourth phase, the installation and commissioning of the system, are under discussion following the inconclusive procurement procedure.Since its establishment in 2002, the Department of Transport has overseen this project through a monthly monitoring committee, comprising officials and Railway Procurement Agency staff. The agency established the integrated ticketing scheme unit to deal specifically with the delivery of the system. The project team chairs a steering committee comprising representatives of Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, Irish Rail, Luas, the Coach Tourism and Transport Council for private licensed bus operators, the Dublin Transportation Office, as well as officials from the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Transport. The agency participates in various working groups with the transport operators and others. It contracted TNS MRBI to undertake a public consultation a view to obtaining consumer input on the development of integrated ticketing. The results of the survey affirmed the validity of the departmental mandate to the agency, as it found that there is significant demand for integrated ticketing.The phased roll-out of integrated ticketing using smartcard technology is taking place in line with international experience. Such systems have been or are being deployed in cities, regions and countries throughout Europe and the world, including London, Paris, Hong Kong, Washington DC, Northern Ireland, Scotland, the Netherlands and Denmark. In April 2004 a private operator, Morton's Coaches, in conjunction with the Railway Procurement Agency and as a "proof of concept", successfully launched smartcards on its services. Last March, another step was taken with the launch of smartcards on Luas services. The Luas smartcard deployment is helping to obtain important feedback from passengers and to provide operational experience for the next stage of integrated ticketing. Approximately 1,000 smart cards are being used by customers of Morton's Coaches and some 8,500 smart cards are in use on Luas services.Some €8.536 million of Exchequer funds has been spent on integrated ticketing since the RPA was appointed to undertake the project. Some €349,000 was spent on the first phase — project appraisal and related activities — in 2002. Some €3.615 million was spent on the second phase — the national design of integrated ticketing, including the proof of concept with Morton's Coaches, the public consultation and related activities — between 2003 and mid-2004. Some €4.572 million has been spent on the third phase of the project — procurement, incorporating the Luas smart card deployment and system integration work to facilitate multi-operator and multi-equipment supplier support for the project, and related activities — since 2004.

Alternatively, they must be engaged in sea fishing as a self-employed person on a fishing boat entered in the register of fishing boats, or on a fishing boat and in a place in respect of which a licence for fishing for salmon at sea has been issued. In the latter set of circumstances, they must be in receipt of one of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit if they were previously on a community employment scheme, or disability allowance. Any persons participating in a FÁS community employment scheme who meet the above eligibility criteria have the option to transfer to the rural social scheme. Participants in the scheme are not permitted to undertake any other employment, apart from their primary farming and fishing work, which yields a payment of more that €88.88 per week.

Following computer validation of the application, it was found that 11 of the animals concerned were non-CMMS compliant. The animals were not registered on the CMMS database as being in the herd of the person named on the date of application for the premium. This is a basic requirement of the scheme and EU regulations provide that penalties should apply in such instances. Permission to move the animals was granted to the person in question on 16 December 2004 and the completed movement notification was returned on 8 March 2005. The Department of Agriculture and Food had notified the person in question, by letter dated 23 February 2005, that the animals were non-CMMS compliant. In appealing the decision to reject the animals, the person maintained that the movement notification had been forwarded prior to the application under the scheme being submitted. There is no evidence of this, however. The only record in the Department is the receipt of the movement notification of 8 March 2005. Therefore, the Department has no alternative but to apply the proposed penalty. It is open to the person in question to appeal the decision to the agriculture appeals office if she wishes to do so.

Day-to-day operational matters, such as the sale of land and issues surrounding the sale of land, are the responsibility of the company. Under section 14 of the Forestry Act 1988 and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, Coillte has certain responsibilities and duties when selling land. I am satisfied that all such obligations and duties were properly discharged by Coillte in this instance. Notwithstanding the fact that Coillte is a private commercial company, I have made some inquiries on foot of the Deputy's queries. I understand that Coillte did not consult the local community prior to the sale of the land in question. A requirement for consultation is now part of Coillte's procedures, but that was not the case when this sale was negotiated. The receipts from the sale were used in the management and development of the company's overall activities. There was no specific reinvestment of the receipts in the local area. The sale of the 400 acres in question, which realised €2.75 million, was negotiated by private contract and was not the subject of a tendering process.

Each application for funding undergoes a thorough assessment by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, which has been engaged by my Department to carry out the day to day administration of the programme. All assessed applications are then considered by the programme appraisal committee, PAC, which is chaired by my Department, before a final decision is made regarding funding.The assessment on the group's application was completed by ADM and it was referred to the PAC for consideration. In the light of all information available at that stage, the PAC was unable to recommend the project for funding under the staffing measure of the EOCP as the demand for the service in the area was not substantiated. Accordingly, it was not possible to make EOCP staffing funding available to the group on that occasion.An appeal of this decision has been lodged by the group in question to my Department. In line with normal practice when an appeal is lodged, I understand that ADM is re-examining the application and any additional information supplied in its support and that this process is in the final stages of assessment. When this is completed, the appeal will be re-submitted to the PAC for consideration following which a decision on the grant application will be made and communicated to the group at the earliest possible date. In the event that an appeal is unsuccessful, it is open to a group to reapply should the circumstances change.

There is no general policy of restriction in operation for family reunion where the family members in question are not visa required. The only caveat is that the worker in question must be in a position to support the family without recourse to public funds. The spouses and children of the majority of foreign national workers in the State fall into this category.The general condition for visa required family members of non-EEA national workers is that before they may be joined by their families, the worker must have been legally resident in the State for 12 months and must have been offered employment for a further 12 months. Again, this is subject to the worker being able to support the family without recourse to public funds.In 2000, the aforementioned 12 month waiting period was reduced to three months by my predecessor in the case of the family members of workers employed in certain specified high skills areas covered by the working visa programme.The considerations underpinning the policy for visa required families are to ensure that the worker's presence in Ireland has a degree of stability and is likely to be for the longer term. Our practice avoids a family joining a worker whose employment situation is not yet up and running and where that position may prove to be short term.The family reunification conditions have not proved to be a disincentive to migrant workers as the number of work permits issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been significant with around 100,000 new permits, excluding renewals, issued in the last five years.The level of renewal of work permits has also been high. In 2004, approximately 68% of all permits issued were renewals. This would not indicate any significant outflow of work permit holders from the economy. I will examine the issue of family reunification fully in the context of the development of the proposed Immigration and Residence Bill.

The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past 20 years and it will involve an additional annual investment of some €40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second-level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The identification and analysis processes are being managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of my Department.As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural, and 150 second-level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters-communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools in relation to the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.

To facilitate pupils who would ordinarily have attended this school, the Department of Education and Science has sanctioned a request for a change of status from a neighbouring school. This will enable the enrolment of senior boys into this school which, heretofore, catered for mixed infants and senior girls only. Given the pattern of declining enrolments in the area in which the closing school is located, I am satisfied there is adequate capacity to cater for current and future demand for pupil places.

Pupils not attending their nearest national school may, subject to conditions, avail of concessionary fare-paying transport to another school, subject to spare accommodation being available on the bus and provided that no extra State cost is incurred by extending or re-routing the service. Pupils who do not meet the distance requirement may also avail of concessionary fare-paying transport subject to similar conditions.The eligibility of the pupils in question for concessionary fare-paying transport was assessed by Bus Éireann, which organises school transport on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, subject to the usual terms of the school transport scheme. The Department of Education and Science understands that after all eligible pupils were accommodated on the service concerned, there was not sufficient spare accommodation to facilitate all the pupils applying for concessionary fare-paying transport, including the pupils in question.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The findings from the HEA report on participation in higher education in 2003 show that the Irish participation rate in higher education stands at 54% up from 44% from the year 1998 and the Government has increased third level places by 30,000 since 1998. I am committed to increasing this participation rate. The capacity to realise this increase lies within the system as a whole, rather than any particular sector.While I have accepted the principle of continuing with the binary model of higher education, I also accept that all our higher education institutions should play to their strengths, irrespective of whether they are an institute of technology or a university. Both sectors are equally important and relevant to the economy and both play a critical role in meeting skills needs and furthering our objective to become a knowledge society. The OECD report, Review of Higher Education, noted that one of the strengths of our higher education system is the extent to which a diversity of mission has been maintained between the university and institute of technology sectors.

This indicates that, nationally, participation rates in higher education as a percentage of 17 to 19 year olds stood at 54%. This was up from 44% in 1998. The report showed that higher education participation rates in the south-east region in 2003 were above the national average. The rates for each of the counties in the region were Waterford, 58%; Kilkenny, 54%; Wexford, 57%; Carlow, 57% and Tipperary61%. These figures reflect a good relative level of accessibility to higher education in the region, which is served by Waterford IT, Carlow IT and the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute. The highest rates of participation were to be found in County Leitrim, 75%, while the lowest were to be found in parts of Dublin.A national office for equity of access to higher education has been established within the Higher Education Authority with a remit to identify and address the range of factors that may be giving rise to inequitable levels of access to higher education on geographical, socio-economic or other grounds. The office is working on the implementation of an action plan for achieving equity of access to higher education, which I launched in December 2004. The action plan identifies six key goals under which a range of interventions and initiatives are proposed. This reflects the Government's commitment to ensuring that the benefits of higher education are widely and equitably available in the interests of enhanced personal development opportunity and a range of wider social and economic benefits for the State.

Section 4 of the Act provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, provide for the insertion in the Schedule of any industrial school, reformatory school, orphanage, children's home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department has been contacted by individuals and or solicitors with regard to various institutions not specified in the Schedule. Following consideration of the matter and consultation with relevant public bodies, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further order was made on 1 July 2005 adding three institutions to the Schedule.The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Departments and it is not proposed to add any further institutions or hospitals to the Schedule at this point.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	632	Thermal performance and insulation standards for new dwellings under part L of the building regulations have been progressively increased since their introduction in 1992 and are due for further upward adjustment by 2008.The national climate change strategy, NCCS, proposed that 1997 part L standards, operative since 1 July 1998, be significantly increased in two phases in mid-2002 and 2005. The NCCS stated the planned increases were contingent on the outcome of an independent study, commissioned by the building regulations advisory body, BRAB, on the impact of the proposed further increase in thermal performance standards on, inter alia, building systems. The relevant report, by the energy research group in University College Dublin, concluded that the most commonly used house building systems could all be insulated to comply with the proposed part L regime subject to minor adjustments in the proposed standards.Consequently it was decided to bring forward the planned second phase, 2005, amendment of the part L regulations and to implement the radical increase in thermal performance standards in a single step. Following a public consultation process, amending part L regulations were made in 2002 for new dwellings commencing on or after 1 January 2003. The greatly enhanced standards will reduce energy required for domestic space heating by an estimated 23% to 33%, depending on the type and size of dwelling.The 2002 regulations contained a transitional provision whereby the enhanced part L standards do not apply to new dwellings for which planning permission was sought on or before 31 December 2002, provided substantial work has been completed on the new dwellings involved by 31 December 2005. This type of transitional provision is a common feature of building regulation amendments; and is designed to ensure that major changes in building code requirements do not disrupt the construction of new dwellings at an advanced stage of planning or design.Under the EU energy performance of buildings directive, 2002/91/EC, of 16 December 2002, building energy performance certificates will be required for newly constructed buildings and for existing buildings when sold or let. The certificates will become mandatory on a phased basis over the period 2007 to 2009. For dwellings, the certificate will relate to levels of energy use in standard conditions rather than to heating costs, which also fluctuate in response to changes in fuel prices.As indicated in section 2.4 of the draft action plan for the implementation of the energy performance of buildings directive in Ireland, April 2005, building energy performance certificates will add to a wide range of factors affecting the marketability of houses for letting or sale. A copy of the draft action plan is available in the Oireachtas Library.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	633	Under the Air Pollution Act 1987, the occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, is required to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent emissions, including smoke emissions, from such premises. In addition, the occupier of any premises is prohibited from causing or permitting an emission in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance. The Act provides local authorities with powers to prevent or limit air pollution and penalties include fines and/or imprisonment upon conviction.The Waste Management Act 1996 places a general duty of care on the holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Local authorities are empowered to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding or disposal of waste, and mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity. Implementation is a matter for each local authority having regard to the circumstances in its functional area.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-06 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The Ozone in Ambient Air Regulations 2004, which transpose Directive 2002/3/EC, were signed on 11 February 2004. Under these regulations, the directive is being implemented and enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency. This includes responsibility for ensuring, or causing to be ensured, that ozone monitoring equipment is accurate and appropriately situated.The 2004 regulations require the agency routinely to inform the public, on at least a daily basis and, wherever appropriate and practicable, on an hourly basis, of the concentrations of ozone in ambient air. The agency is doing this, inter alia, through its air quality website which was launched in January 2004.Also under the regulations, where the information threshold, 180 µg/m, or the new more stringent alert threshold, 240 µg/m, is exceeded, or where practicable is predicted to be exceeded, the agency is required to make certain information publicly available as soon as possible and by appropriate means. The information to be made available includes the exceedance, its location, start time, duration, forecasted changes in concentrations, the type of population groups potentially at risk, possible health effects and recommended conduct, and preventive action to reduce pollution or exposure to it.Due to Ireland's geographical location and meteorological circumstances, ozone pollution has not been a significant problem here. No exceedances of the 180 µg/m; information threshold were reported by the EPA on behalf of Ireland during the last eight summer seasons from 1997 to 2004 when hot weather conditions and the presence of ozone precursors which chemically react in sunlight caused ozone pollution episodes in many parts of mainland Europe.I understand from the agency that in 2003 one relatively minor exceedance of the population information threshold was recorded at a concentration level of 181.2 µg/m. This occurred on 18 April, Good Friday, between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. and lasted for one hour. Owing to a problem earlier in the day with the data transmission element of the agency's automatic monitoring system, this specific concentration level was not notified to Met Éireann for public information broadcast. When this anomaly came to light the next day following contact by Met Éireann, the agency rectified the problem immediately. Given the relatively minor nature of the exceedance, its short duration, and the maintenance of subsequent readings below 180 µg/m, the agency did not ask Met Éireann to issue any public information alert as the exceedance had happened the previous day.
