#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 4 together. The junior cycle student award, JCSA, will no longer be a terminal exam with high stakes. Treating it as such has been shown to have an unintended negative backwash effect onteaching and learning in the classroom and can, in some cases, lead to an unnecessary focus on rote learning. Our 15 year olds do not need a State-certified examination, just as in 1967 it was decided that 12 year olds did not need a State-certified examination at the end of primary school. Assessment should assist students in their learning and not be regarded as the end point. Assessment is not about "proving" but about "improving" learning outcomes. I am reliably informed by education specialists that unless assessment changes, nothing else will. Any reform must address this and other factors. We must not have students experiencing a junior cycle where there is more focus on rote learning and memorisation than on teaching them how to think critically for themselves, solve problems, communicate and work with others - all the skills that are necessary for further and higher education and indeed for life. The new junior cycle will develop better learners. Students will be more skilled in areas such as communication, creativity, managing information, self-management and working with others. As the Deputies will recall, these reforms received all-party support in both Houses of the Oireachtas when we debated them in late 2012. I set up a national working group for junior cycle last January as a forum to address identified challenges and opportunities proactively as they arise over the phased implementation time schedule for the junior cycle from now until at least September 2019, when all the subjects will have been phased in. My officials, through this national working group, are engaged in intensive discussions with the education stakeholders. A subgroup is considering in detail the issue of quality assurance and support for teacher assessment. As part of its remit, this subgroup is addressing external supports for moderation to support teacher assessment and help maintain standards. Some education partners have made detailed written submissions to the subgroup which are under active consideration. I expect to receive a report on these issues from the national working group in May. I have noted the results of the recent teacher ballots. The national working group and its subgroups are the best place to address concerns that have been raised. In fact, I have already agreed to changes in the phasing in of the reforms in response to concerns raised by education partners. I welcome the continued engagement by the teacher unions with these forums. In so far as continuing professional development, CPD, is concerned, most of the planned workshops for this academic year have already been rolled out. The junior cycle will roll out to schools from this September on a phased basis, as reiterated in a recent circular issued by my Department. The new specification for junior cycle English will be implemented from September. The level 2 learning programme for a very small number of students with special educational needs will be optional, as will short courses. The first school-based assessment event under the new JCSA for junior cycle English will take place after Easter 2016. In the interim, I am committed to ongoing discussion with the education partners on all aspects of the phased implementation of the JCSA.

We find ourselves in an unfortunate position and one, moreover, which was entirely avoidable. There is widespread agreement in regard to the need for junior certificate reform by making it a lower-stakes examination which would result in a change in how students learn. We should not be in a position in which this reform is being introduced in the face of industrial action by teachers. This dispute is very much a consequence of the manner in which the Minister has handled the process from the outset. One of the key concerns regarding these proposals relates to the need for ongoing independent assessment. The lack of hands-on involvement by the Minister in terms of engaging with the partners involved in delivering junior certificate reform has led to the current difficulties. The Minister said yesterday that he is willing to discuss the issue of independent assessment and marking of examinations. We have heard this from him more than once, but there has been no real engagement thus far. Will he indicate what he is willing to consider in this regard? Does he accept that there must continue to be independent assessment of examinations? The junior certificate can become a lower-stakes examination but it should not be an inconsistent one.

Nobody is suggesting that we should go back to the primary certificate examination that was done away with in 1967. It is, in the same vein, a political decision to do away with the State examination for 15 year olds. That decision is my responsibility. In terms of how it is implemented, I am, of course, open to discussion. In fact, we continue to request of the two trade unions representing post-primary teachers that they set down in writing what resources they want us to provide. To give some comfort in regard to their concerns, I have slowed down the timetable for implementation by at least one year and possibly two. In addition, the State Examinations Commission will set and mark the examinations in English, Irish and mathematics for the foreseeable future. We are talking about an event that is due to take place in June 2017. There is time for us to address teachers' concerns.I am still waiting for the unions to give me in writing what they want by way of resources.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	If the Minister had engaged more constructively from the outset, he would not be in the position of having to ask for this now. The two times he has outlined the timetable for implementation of the new junior cycle student award, he has done so unilaterally and without consultation with other partners. The first time he did it, he found he had to revisit the matter. The second timetable he outlined was not one prepared by way of consultation either. It was one he introduced himself. Given that approach, it is no surprise that the Minister now finds himself in a situation of conflict. The new award will undoubtedly make a significant difference to second level education and will benefit students a great deal. However, there are genuine concerns. We must continue to ensure that there is independent assessment. Will the Minister commit to reconsidering that and taking on board the concerns that exist among teachers and parents?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	As Minister for Education and Skills, a responsibility the Deputy may well have himself some day, with a mandate from the electorate and accountability to other Deputies, one cannot be put in a position in which a stakeholder simply says "No, you cannot change the status of exams." That is what the unions have said. The two unions have said they are ultimately opposed to removing the State certification of the junior cycle. They want the junior certificate to remain as it is. That is the responsibility of people in this House. How we do it and how it is implemented is, of course, open to consultation. In that regard, I am still waiting for the unions to give me what it is they want in writing. The autonomy of the Minister for Education and Skills is an interest shared across all political parties. The Minister must be able to act on the basis of the best evidence. I refer the Deputy to an article published recently by Emer Smyth and Frances Ruane of the ESRI. This is the right way to go. How quickly we get there and all the other things will, of course, be discussed. I am open to discussion and we are still discussing it. However, the unions cannot hold a veto over the new destination for education in this country.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	Is the Minister saying that despite all of the engagement with the unions and their participation in the working groups, they have not yet given him a firm indication of what resources are needed to roll out the junior cycle reform? There has been a great deal of discussion of self-assessment, which is where the nub of the problem seems to be. Having spoken to teachers, it does not appear that the issue is one of self-assessment per se. Most teachers assess their students by way of Christmas and Easter exams and ongoing assessments throughout the year. The crux of the issues appears to be at the State examination level. There must be an independent analysis or verification of the assessment. That is where the focus needs to be. I wonder how we will get there. I have a daughter who is entering post-primary education this year. She will be one of the first students to do the new cycle. Speaking to parents at the school gate, I see that they do not know what is happening. They do not know what changes will be made and how it will affect their children who are entering first year this year. We need to rectify that as we are running out of time very quickly.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	We are tight for time. In fact, we lost the summer months for discussion as one of the unions was re-balloting its members in relation to Haddington Road, a separate issue altogether. I confirm to the Deputy that I have not received formally and in writing from the unions notice of the extra resources they want. We have received from management bodies at post-primary level suggestions about what they need to bring in the changes. The Deputy is right about the changes. We are very anxious to sit down and talk to the unions to see what kind of assessment can be done and how, but it will be a low-stakes exam. We were prepared to discuss models, suggestions, comparators and indications of normal practice to provide assurance. To repeat what I said to Deputy McConalogue, as an interim transition in the three key subjects of English, Irish and maths, there will be a written exam and there will be assistance in relation to it. It will be set and marked by the State Examinations Commission for the time being. We are talking about something from 2017 onwards. I am open to discussing realistically, practically and in a way that gives comfort and assurance to everybody how to implement this, but I cannot accept a veto on its implementation.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	Is the implementation group still meeting and are the unions still participating in it?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	Yes. They are still engaging in that forum and we are still making progress.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I understand from Caranua that between 6 January and the end of March it received 2,345 applications. The first part of the application process is to verify that an applicant is eligible to apply. To the end of March, 2,145 applications have been verified as eligible and 20 deemed ineligible. The remaining 180 applications are still being examined. Following the initial assessment, Caranua confirms an applicant's identity. By the end of March, verification of identity had been completed for 504 applicants. Caranua has contacted 113 applicants by telephone to discuss what the applicant wishes to apply for. Of these, 73 have been assigned to an applications adviser. The intention is that the remaining 40 will be assigned an adviser shortly. The adviser provides assistance and further information about applying for services. At this stage, assessments can be arranged if necessary or an applicant may be referred to someone locally who can provide face-to-face assistance. I understand that by the end of March, 26 applications for approved services had been approved for medical and dental services, orthopaedic equipment, home repairs and education grants.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	The Minister's reply referred to just over 2,000 applicants. In a previous statement to the House, he said that approximately 15,000 people might be eligible to apply. What steps is Caranua taking to contact the additional 13,000 persons? The number of applications approved at the end of February was four, and it is now up to 26. It seems like a very low number given the number of applications which have come in. Only 73 applications have progressed to the advisory level. It seems to be a very slow process. The Minister will be well aware that many applicants are elderly and time is of the essence for them in accessing services. Has anyone mentioned the fact that it is such a slow process?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	As with all new organisations, there were some teething problems in the establishment of Caranua. The chairperson of the board had to step down for personal reasons. Notwithstanding that, we have a director in place and approximately 15% of the potential 15,000 eligible persons have applied. I will discuss with the board whether the information provided to the interest group has been sufficient to ensure that people are not deterred from applying and are aware of how to apply. I will report to the Deputy on that.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	A person attended my constituency office last week who had made an application. Unfortunately, he was turned down. There is a limit of €5,000 per year for back-to-education grants. The course he had applied for was a cookery course which exceeded that limit. On that basis, he was turned down. Is there any flexibility built into the system? I acknowledge that Caranua is an independent statutory agency and the Minister has no power in relation to it, but is there any flexibility for individuals? It was a one-year course.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	If the Deputy wishes to give me the details of the case, I will explore it within the context of the independence of the organisation itself.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	At primary level, a teacher exchange scheme exists whereby a teacher may voluntarily exchange with a teacher in any other school. The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years. There are 25 exchanges involving 50 teachers currently in place in primary schools.Given that such exchanges are for limited periods of time, it is not appropriate for such teachers to have panel rights in respect of their new schools. The exchange scheme was agreed to under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council, the body established in accordance with the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers. The council is composed of representatives of teachers, school managements and the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform and chaired by an official from the Labour Relations Commission. Any change to the exchange scheme is, therefore, a matter for the council.

As he indicated, the teacher exchange programme can last from one to five years, which makes it temporary. Other temporary teachers in the areas in which a person is participating in an exchange can acquire panel rights, in that, after a certain period, they have the option to apply for jobs in these areas. Participants in the exchange programme may develop ties and commitments in their new areas. While most will want to revert to their base schools, those who do not should, after a certain period, be treated like other temporary teachers in these areas. If they decide not to revert to their base schools, they could have an opportunity to seek alternative employment in other schools in their exchange areas, bearing in mind the fact that the teachers with whom they exchanged will probably want to return. Would the Minister be willing to consider this suggestion? Has he given consideration to a permanent exchange programme or would he be willing to do so?

However, in the light of the Deputy's question, I am happy to consider it. I will review the position and write to him. The initiative is probably with the teachers' unions and representatives, but I will send a more comprehensive answer to the Deputy. He can then decide on the best way forward.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I thank the Minister for agreeing to do this. I look forward to engaging with him further on the matter.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I recently announced that an additional 390 special needs assistant, SNA, posts had been made available to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to allocate to schools to the end of 2014, bringing the total number of SNAs available to 10,965. An additional 480 resource teaching posts have also been made available for the current school year, bringing to over 10,700 the number of resource teaching-learning support teachers in mainstream schools. This is a greater number of SNA and resource teachers than has been allocated at any time previously. In May 2013 the NCSE published policy advice on supporting students with special needs in schools and made a number of recommendations to improve special education provision. At my request, it has developed proposals for a new model for the allocation of teaching supports to schools. I will consider these proposals carefully, with my colleagues in government, in order to establish how best we can continue to make improvements to special education provision.
#ColmKeaveney	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-party	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-dob	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I thank the Minister for his response. We all acknowledge that many great advancements have been made in the past decade in special needs provision for children. I welcome the 390 additional posts in this regard. However, there remains an issue of resources across the country, as there are black spot areas in Dublin, Dublin West and north Kildare in particular. One school enrolled two junior infant classes at the commencement of last year, totalling 54 children. Half way through the academic year, it came to the attention of the school authorities that three children had challenging needs. From the initial consultations with the parents in 2013, it was obvious that this was the case. It came as no surprise to the school, as an assessment of needs was carried out for one of the children involved. During the course of the academic year, it became apparent to the principal that there was a problem with securing resources for these children. The parents of one child secured an assessment of needs, as a consequence of which the child received 4.2 hours per week of low-incidence teaching. Half way through this year, the other two children are still awaiting their assessments. The first year of their educational lives has been lost because they lack the critical supports they require to participate successfully.

If he wishes to send me the details, I will examine the specific case. The allocation of resources is based on an assessment conducted by a special educational needs organiser or, in some cases, depends on private arrangements made by parents. I believe that is what the Deputy is referring to.
#ColmKeaveney	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-party	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-dob	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I thank the Minister for his invitation to forward the details. Does he not believe there is an opportunity for every child to undergo developmental needs assessments at three and a half years of age through the public health system? Is there not a more effective way of establishing a child's needs one year before entering the primary school system? Not every parent can afford to borrow from a credit union or put a hand in his or her pocket to have a needs assessment made. Another Department is involved, but I am prepared to accept that the Minister is flexible enough to consider the integration of some data from primary care settings and the Department of Education and Skills to assess children's needs.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	Relationships and sexuality education, RSE, is one component of social, personal and health education, SPHE, in the existing junior cycle. As part of the new junior cycle student awards, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is finalising its specification for a new short course in SPHE. The development of the specification, including consultations and reviews of existing data, is, therefore, based on evidence and best practice. The SPHE short course will be available to schools from September 2014. Circular 20/14 clarifies the position for schools in respect of SPHE and other subject areas for the 2014-15 school year. Schools may choose to incorporate the SPHE short course into their junior cycle programmes either for certification purposes or not for certification. They may also choose not to offer the new short course and continue instead to offer the existing SPHE syllabus. There are no plans to review the content of the RSE curriculum at primary level or at senior cycle.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	RSE is part of the curriculum and schools are obligated to implement it, but the curriculum sets out that the programme must be delivered within the ethos and value system of each school. While this is all well and good and it is progressive that post-primary schools are implementing RSE programmes at junior and senior cycle, that it is being implemented on an ethos basis means that some LGBT students may feel isolated or may not be getting the information they require. One of the downfalls is that the programme is not based on life experiences. What criteria are used when deciding on who to invite to a school to discuss these matters? We have heard recent reports of people visiting schools to speak about abortion instead of, for example, contraception or LGBT issues, which are relevant to students.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I am aware of those reports. These concerns have also been raised by a number of people in my party and other parties in the House. I welcome this question.Notwithstanding the independence and ethos of each school, I have been informed about the invitations to external visitors and agencies that are issued by such schools. According to my note, all programmes and events delivered by visitors and external agencies must use appropriate evidence-based methodologies with clear educational outcomes. Such programmes are best delivered by those specifically qualified to work with young people for whom the programmes are designed. In the management notes to the schools in question, it is strongly recommended that parents should be consulted and made aware of any such people or agencies visiting classrooms and schools. This would address the concerns of parents who may have had no choice but to send their child or children to a particular school.  The miscellaneous legislation I will be bringing forward both here and in the Upper House fairly soon will provide for a parents' charter that will strengthen the communications and rights of parents in this and other matters.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	I welcome that. I particularly want to focus on the LGBT sector. If we allow schools to teach sex education based on a particular ethos or value, students from an LGBT background or community will effectively be silenced or whitewashed. It is just not right in this day and age, so it will have to be addressed. The Minister has undertaken a lot of work on homophobic bullying and I compliment him on that. Great strides have been made in that regard. However, I do not want to see all the work the Department has done to tackle homophobic bullying being undone by schools where LGBT issues are effectively whitewashed from sex education.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	I thank the Deputy for his concern and his comments, which I share. I propose to ask the Department to raise this matter in its regular meetings with the joint management bodies. Those are the groups responsible in post-primary schools, but we can also do it with the Catholic Primary School Managers Association or CPSMA.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15099	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	The latest PISA report from the OECD's programme for international student assessment, PISA, shows that 15-year-old students in Ireland performed at the average level of participating countries on computer-based assessment of problem solving. Ireland ranked 17th of the 28 OECD countries that took part in the study, and 22nd out of all 44 participating countries. Countries like the United States, Norway, Denmark and Sweden performed similarly to Ireland, while Canada, Australia, Finland and the United Kingdom performed significantly better than Ireland. The top six performing countries are in Asia, with Singapore ranked first. The performance of Irish students on problem solving in this PISA study is good but there is considerable room for improvement. Project Maths and the emphasis on skills development in the new junior cycle student awards, JCSA, offer students and teachers new ways of thinking and learning that should improve our 15-year-olds' problem-solving capabilities.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	I thank the Minister of State for his response. The Educational Research Centre's analysis of the result makes the point that students in Ireland have lower levels of familiarity with using ICT in schools and at home for school-related tasks than on average across all 34 OECD countries. This suggests a lack of familiarity with school-based computer tasks which has contributed to lower performance on the computer-based assessment by PISA. The ERC also suggests that Ireland's relatively weaker performance in problem solving appears to be compounded by a more general weakness on computer-based assessments. I know the Department is due to bring forward a digital strategy for schools, but when will this be finalised? What is the timeframe for its implementation and what will the strategy's budget be? Has the Minister of State assessed, more deeply than his initial answer would indicate, the reasons behind our relatively average performance in this particular result?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15099	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	As has been articulated in other answers by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, we are moving away from a rote learning framework to one which is inquiry-based and which puts the student at the centre of problem solving. Therefore a paradigm shift is going on. I cannot give the Deputy an answer regarding the cost of the digital strategy but I will revert to him with that information. There will be significant improvements in ICT infrastructure with the roll-out of broadband being available to all second-level schools in the autumn. The priorities and challenges of the digital strategy are currently being examined as part of an ongoing consultative process.  There is a school of thought that says we may have to look outside the Department concerning the digital strategy and maybe incorporate more stakeholders, including students themselves, in meeting head-on the challenges of PISA and learn from them. As regards the methodologies involved, there is a marked difference between paper-based and computer-based problem solving. We have done extremely well vis-à-vis PISA on paper-based problems. However, there is clearly a deficit in the presentation of scenarios to students for the purposes of PISA marking. 
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. He said that paper-based problem solving shows us way ahead of the average, while computer-based problem solving shows us very much at the average level. That is an important point because it shows that students currently have the ability to think through and solve such problems. The reform of the junior certificate will be important in terms of trying to enhance that ability. The key point emerging from these results, however, focuses on IT services and facilities in schools. We have heard a lot from people who have concerns about what is planned under the junior certificate reform plans, including what ICT tools teachers will be given. Such facilities will help to deliver and expand new ways of learning. Can the Minister of State elaborate on any plans he has to improve the ICT-based facilities in schools, including computers, apart from the ongoing broadband improvements?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15099	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	One needs broadband provision in the first instance in order to give effect to a digital strategy. That strategy is not yet under way and work remains to be done both internally and externally. The key purpose of this is to ensure that students have a proper understanding of the dynamic involved. People in Ireland are digital natives and instinctively interface with the technology both in schools and elsewhere. However, when certain scenarios were presented to them it showed a deficit, so we need to discover why and tackle it. That is not merely a matter of giving more iPads or tablets to schools, it is a question of how the learning process can be enhanced as a result of interaction with technology. That is part of the digital strategy which needs to be further interrogated. I want to give the Deputy a proper answer. It is not just about throwing money at the problem, it is also about properly interpreting the PISA dynamic and comparing the experiences of other countries. We can take Finland as an exemplar and see how it is done there. We may adopt some of those models into an Irish system. We are getting there but we need to get the ICT roll-out completed in the first instance.

Will the Minister of State reconsider the matter?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I do not intend to revise the changes made in budget 2012 whereby guidance counselling is provided from within the overall staffing allocation of a school. This gives schools greater autonomy to determine how they deploy their teaching resources across the competing needs of schools. With economic recovery and as our budgetary position permits, when the Government is in a position to consider improving the teaching resources for schools, it would not be desirable to return to a situation where there would be a separate allocation for guidance in schools. The principal and leadership of a school should have discretion in deciding on how teachers are deployed for certain purposes. Furthermore, a separate allocation creates a false demarcation and creates an impression that supporting students through guidance and counselling is dependent exclusively on guidance counsellors. Guidance and counselling are a whole school responsibility, with guidance counsellors playing their part within an overall team approach.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	I am rarely appalled in the House, but I am appalled by the Minister of State's response. One realises the seriousness of the economic difficulties we face and appreciates that every Minister is challenged to deal with them, but it is appalling for him to say that when conditions improve, he will not revisit the guidance issue. For 40 years successive Ministers for Education saw to it that principals and vice principals and guidance counsellors were ex-quota. Students need more guidance today than in any period in the past because of the plethora of social problems that confront them and the challenges in the context of progression to third level. Initially, I would have said this was sleight of hand on the part of the Department, but it appears from the Minister for State's response that this is a deliberate policy that is to the detriment of students.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	The Deputy may be aware that the initial policy idea around mainstrreaming guidance provision and sharing responsibility for it across the teaching community in individual schools came from principals. Since September 2012 guidance provision has been organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. There is every reason to expect, as the country's economic position improves, that additional teaching resources will be made available to schools, but it is and should remain the decision of the school managers, board of management and teaching staff how the resources are allocated. There is no reason to make a distinctive demarcation between the role of the guidance counsellor and the implied role of guidance counselling across the teaching profession. That is the thinking behind this. It is not about limiting resources for schools; it is about giving them the autonomy to make the decision and suggesting to other teachers that they have a significant role to play in guidance provision. Such provision can take place in a formal classroom setting or outside the classroom, while a one-to-one service should be available for pupils who are experiencing difficulties. With regard to schools subject to significant challenges, the Department helped to shelter the impact on DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocation. All 195 second level schools in DEIS have been given targeted supported by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee paying second level schools.

The Minister of State is not in a position, given what he has said, to honour his commitments to students throughout the country. He is involved in a process of false economy and the costs to the Department and the State in the long term will be greater as a result of the increased social problems, with which students will have to contend, and difficulties with progression to third level, with increasing numbers of students dropping out in first and second year because adequate counselling was not available to them and they failed to make the correct choices based on what was suitable for them.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15099	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	That is a paternalistic attitude to education.

He said it should be left to the school to decide whether these services should be provided by a guidance counsellor or other teachers. He failed to acknowledge the training and qualifications of guidance counsellors. He is trying to pass on the responsibility these qualified professionals have delivered up to now to all the members of the teaching staff in schools and saying it is not important to have qualified guidance counsellors to carry out that role in each school and providing a good service for students. It is a worrying development and the Minister of State needs to revisit the issue. We cannot have what was built up over years eroded by the approach he is taking and the diminishing respect he is giving to the availability of the service in schools.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The Deputy is diminishing the role of teachers. Many teachers, particularly in post-primary schools, may not be described as qualified guidance counsellors, but they have a deep knowledge of the options available to young people in choosing their third level path. As resources improve, it will be fully within the power of school principals and boards of management to make a decision to make a unique guidance counselling service available, but that decision will be taken by schools as they see fit in the best interests of their students. I do not suggest a diminished guidance service will be available to young people in the future. It will be enhanced and delivered across the school system and if schools choose to provide a unique guidance counselling service, they will have the autonomy and independence to make that decision.

He is in fourth year, but he has been informed by the school that owing to the decision in the Sinnott case which limits the right of children with special needs to an education up to the age of 18 years, he will have nowhere to go when he reaches that age. His mother is distressed by this and also points out that he is one of many in this position. She believes it is unfair discrimination against children with special needs who should have the right to complete their education.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	Special schools are classified as primary national schools and intended to cater for children with special educational needs from the age of 4 years to 18. The Health Service Executive then assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special needs who are over 18 years. Where special schools apply to my Department to retain pupils who, prior to reaching 18 years, had embarked on courses leading to accreditation at FETAC level 3 or above and who require an additional year to complete such a course, my Department will provide sanction for this. It may also provide sanction for special schools, subject to application, to retain a pupil for an additional year to facilitate the transition of a pupil to adult services. Students who transfer to adult service settings can continue to participate in education programmes through further adult education programmes or in adult settings that are allocated resources towards educational provision.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	That is good news. It is a mystery why the school is so adamant that that is not the case. I presumed from my discussion with the mother that there was a resourcing issue. I will pass on the Minister's reply.The mother made a general point on moving children with special needs - her child has Down's syndrome - straight from school settings, in which they would be with other young people, into adult services. She stated children with special needs were often placed in such services alongside adults who were much older than them. This is really not suitable. She also informed me that Carmona Services in Dún Laoghaire had received 200 applications for two places and that - as she discovered, much to her amazement - Roslyn Park College did not take children with Down's syndrome. Again, this appears to give rise to a problem.

I would be more than happy to discuss it with him on a one to one basis. Alternatively, if he forwards the details to me, I will obtain for him bespoke advice on the position on this matter. My initial reply was a general policy response, which shows that there is some flexibility in the context of the time when people reach the age of 18 years. If schools make applications, the Department can grant them the discretion to enable young people, for whatever reason, to continue with their studies until they complete the leaving certificate programme. It is clear that the Deputy is concerned about a specific case and I am of the view that I could obtain for him a more tailored response that would meet the needs of his constituent.

This means that each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties, as appropriate, with their assigned NEPS psychologist. In the 2012-13 academic year NEPS psychologists consulted schools in respect of an estimated 25,000 pupils. In the event of a pupil not making reasonable progress or where he or she requires further additional support, the NEPS may undertake intensive intervention, including assessment of the pupil. In the 2013-13 academic year the NEPS undertook such casework, including assessments, with 8,480 pupils in primary and post-primary schools. In addition, 2,167 assessments were provided for schools through a panel of private practitioners. The nature of the consultative model of service means that the NEPS consults schools on all pupils who are considered to require support. It does not maintain a waiting list for assessments.

I was under the impression that in any academic year schools could only avail of three in-school assessments, whereby someone from the NEPS assessed students on site over a number of days. Will the Minister confirm whether that is the case?

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	The Department will continue to provide a book grant as usual for all primary schools and this grant can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme. The National Parents Council - Primary has surveyed its members on book rental schemes currently in operation. The survey has found that they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, that the cost per child is under €40 per year in the majority of schools and that 93% of parents believe book rental schemes help with the cost of educating a child. A sum of €5 million has been made available this year to support the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools that do not currently operate them. It is my aim to ensure every primary school in the country will have a book rental scheme. If the economic situation improves and I obtain additional resources, the option of extending the grant to other school is one of the possibilities I will consider.

I also thank him and the Government for making €5 million available this year for the establishment of new schemes. I was contacted by the principal of Scoil Shéamais Naofa in Bearna who informed me that it had had a partial book rental scheme in place for the past two years. The scheme cannot be extended to the entire school as a result of issues relating to funding. It is welcome that the Minister is committed to extending the grant if the necessary resources become available.

Results from the census for the current school year - 2013-14 - are being finalised. All data at first level and a final list of schools and their enrolments will be published on my Department's website by the end of the school year. Based on the preliminary figures which were published on the Department's website in March, there were 50 schools with 81 to 85 pupils, 61 schools with 49 to 55 pupils and 55 schools with 12 to 19 pupils. The report on the value for money review of small primary schools will be published as soon as my Government colleagues and I have finalised our consideration of the report and its recommendations. I am not in a position to give a precise publication date at this time.

He has indicated that there are 166 schools in the categories affected by the increase in the pupil threshold necessary to retain existing numbers of teaching staff in such schools. The number in question represents approximately 5% of all schools. As the Minister is well aware, 50% of all primary schools have four teachers or fewer. In addition, 10% of these schools are either in line to lose one teacher or they have not obtained an additional teacher as a result of the increase in the threshold. This means that a significant number of schools are down by one teacher, except in instances where they have appealed the decision and won. If, however, they have won appeals, the reverse is only temporary because if the level of enrolment does not increase, the schools in question will lose a teach in the following year. This is having a major impact in the context of an increase in the number of multi-class environments and the various difficulties attaching to running a school. It also means that significant pressure is being placed on schools to remain in existence and compete with neighbouring schools. It is time the Minister revisited the approach taken during the past three years. The 166 schools in question are under pressure. They should be given the relief, of which they would have been in a position to avail if the Minister had not adopted the very unfair approach of removing teachers from the system.

We had no choice but to make reductions all over the place and this was one of the areas affected. When I made the announcement on this matter, I gave schools a three year horizon within which they might examine their own situations and provide for a degree of planning. I also provided such a horizon in respect of student contributions, otherwise known as fees, at third level and stated that over the four years the figure in this regard would increase from €2,000 to €3,000. I did this in order that there might be a degree of certainty. When the final figures for the current year become available, we will be in a position to discover what has been the impact on the schools to which the Deputy refers. I am not sure whether the figure is 10%, but it is certainly significant. For the communities served by the schools in question, it is definitely significant. I have no proposal to change the pupil-teacher ratio into the future. However, when we are in a position to gauge the full impact - it will not vary a great deal from what we already know - we can examine the physical consequences for schools throughout the country. I would like progress to be made in this matter.

However, the schools involved might inform him that there is a very clear level of uncertainty. What he stated originally was that during the three years from 2012 onwards they would lose teachers.The Minister was giving them certainty that was what was going to happen unless their numbers were significantly increasing. I do not know why he has targeted these schools. What has happened is that four-teacher schools have dropped down to having three teachers, three-teachers schools have dropped down to having two teachers and many two-teacher schools, in which category there is a significant number of Protestant and minority faith schools, are in danger of losing their second teacher. The value for money report is a significant concern in this respect. Why has the Minister been sitting on it for more than a year? Why will he not publish it? Were the measures the Minister has introduced during the past three years part of that report? There is a concern that he has an agenda to try to diminish the resources that are being given to smaller schools to force them into a situation where they have to consider amalgamation. As long as the Minister sits on the report and refuses to publish what is in or to have a discussion on where we are going, the concern in this respect will remain. Can he give us an update on where that report is at and when he will publish it?

I do not think it is a suitable arrangement.

However, if a school is the only school on an island, the pupil threshold for it to remain as a two-teacher school is eight pupils. The number of one-teacher schools over the last five years has varied between four and eight schools. In the 2008-09 school year, there were eight schools, the number reduced to four in the 2010-11 school year and rose to eight again in the past year. I am arranging to have the full tabular details provided to the Deputy in regard to this matter.  I would say, however, that the day to day running of a school, including with just one full-time teacher, is a matter for the board of management of each school. Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are on the school premises during school time and-or on school activities. I do not yet have the complete information relating to the current school year, however, I can tell the Deputy, from the preliminary information available to me, there are 60 mainland schools below the threshold of 20 pupils and of seven island schools that are below the threshold of 20 pupils, four of the schools are two-teacher schools. There are two island schools below the threshold of eight pupils. The complete information in regard to all schools will be placed on the Department's website in June of this year.Table showing the number of one-teacher schools over the five-year period 2008-9 to 2012-13.School yearNumber of one-teacher schoolsTotal number of pupils2008/98 (1 island)482000/106 (1 island)382010/114 (1 island)362011/125 (1 island)372012/138 (2 islands)61

In regard to island schools, can he confirm that if the number of pupils falls below eight for one year, the number must then increase to 20 to get back the second teacher? Does he think it is likely or possible that will happen in schools on small islands where the number of pupils has already dropped to eight?

That is my intention because of the very nature of those schools. The Deputy may be aware of this, and I have additional information in regard to two islands because of the viability of island communities. That is a separate case altogether and I am prepared to talk to people about that matter, but we have to examine the implications of the impact if that is the case and the number of pupils in a school has fallen below eight. The threshold now is 20.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	We had the case of the school in Inis Meáin where the number of pupils dropped for one year but the school authorities were told that they will have to meet the new threshold figure - we appealed that decision in every way possible and made personal appeals to the Minister - which now is 20 to get back the second teacher. It is not a question of the school bringing the number of pupils back to over eight; once the number falls below eight, the number has to increase to 20. That is the rule and that is what we were told by officials in the Department and that is what the Minister told them. Can he confirm to the House that in fact is the situation?

That is very progressive and important. I am glad the Minister has recognised the unique community situation on the island and, in many cases, the unique cultural heritage that we have inherited. I have often pointed out that we keep crying over the Blasket Islands, but the culture that was there is long gone but that culture is alive and well on islands like Inis Meáin and the Aran Islands. As the Minister's policy progresses, can the Minister confirm that the number of one-teacher schools in the country is likely to increase from under ten to about 60?

The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I published an action plan on bullying in January of last year which sets out 12 actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in schools. I have made €500,000 available in 2014 and I am satisfied that this is an adequate sum of money to support the implementation of the action plan.  The implementation of the actions is progressing. New anti-bullying national procedures were published last September. These will be adopted and form the basis for anti-bullying policies in all schools during this school year. In addition, training materials for parents, teacher and boards of management are being developed and rolled out. Awareness raising initiatives on cyberbullying, including Up2Us, a new resource to tackle cyberbullying, are provided through the Internet safety initiative, Webwise. In 2013 and 2014 the Department supported safer Internet day, an initiative that addresses Internet safety issues, including cyberbullying, for young people. The Department also supported the Stand Up! awareness week against homophobic and transphobic bullying in second level schools which took place in March 2013 and 2014 and has commissioned research on bullying of particular groups, which will be published this year. Implementation of these and other actions identified in the plan will continue in 2014.

Obviously, the implementation of the anti-bullying plan involves everyone within a school and it is important that everyone works together to ensure that students are kept safe and that there is a happy environment within the school. With reference to the guidance counsellor role, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, took the earlier direct question on that matter and in his response he very much seemed to indicate that it was entirely a matter for the school and seemed to minimise the importance of a school ensuring that it had a fully qualified guidance counsellor available to play his or her part within the school, working along with others. We seem to be seeing from the Minister and the Department that this particular role is being diminished. It is particularly important in regard to the implementation of this plan and also in regard to providing the ancillary supports necessary as part of a comprehensive anti-bullying strategy within each school.Will the Minister comment on the role of guidance counsellors and whether he agrees with the response given earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	From my point of view the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, gave a very accurate response in answer to the supplementary questions asked by Deputy Ó Fearghaíl. When considering reductions in the overall pupil-teacher ratio at second level, we had to make a difficult choice regarding the idea that a particular category of teacher would be ring-fenced and ex-quota when in many cases these teachers were qualified to teach a subject before they became guidance counsellors. I will be very frank with Deputies McConalogue and O'Brien. Reducing the overall pupil-teacher ratio in post-primary schools has an uneven effect which is very difficult to predict because we do not have the information as to the impact on subject choice in a post-primary school if the pupil-teacher ratio is reduced and a teacher is lost, either immediately or very quickly, as a consequence. Therefore, I did not reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in post-primary schools but I did mainstream the guidance teacher allocation. This was the equivalent of a reduction of 0.6 in the pupil-teacher ratio. I did this because I was under economic pressure to do so and because the principals of many schools had come to me informally and stated they would prefer to deploy the guidance teacher resource, including guidance provision, throughout the school, so that when guidance provision was done the teachers could be allocated to other requirements within the school. There is an ongoing debate about leadership in schools and having as much autonomy and resources as possible at the discretion of the principal and his or her team. This is what we are trying to do. I fully support the position articulated by the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, because it is clearly in line with the position we have enunciated for some time.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	The approach we are seeing from the Minister and the policy he has adopted very much diminishes the importance of the guidance counsellor role vis-à-vis other teaching roles in schools. One would not send a teacher qualified in Irish to teach English unless he or she also had a qualification in English. Likewise, one would not have someone who was unqualified teaching a maths class; nor would the Minister advocate it. What the Minister stated in his response is that to avoid an impact on subject choice he decided that the least worst option was a reduction in the guidance counselling role and that principals could cut this if they so decided to provide greater subject choice or to cater for other needs in the school. I do not think this is acceptable. The response we have received from the Minister and Minister of State that other teachers can do this work acknowledges the fact the role played by guidance counsellors is very important and specialist in terms of career guidance, which is a traditional role in which much knowledge is required, and with regard to counselling, in which they are qualified and which requires qualifications. We are going down a dangerous road in removing an essential service that has been built up over a period of time. Not acknowledging this and standing over the fact that he will continue this approach is something about which the Minister must think very seriously. He must change the direction in which he is going.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy. The two traditional aspects to guidance counsellors are pastoral care and actual career guidance. The resources for career guidance, the amount of information available and a host of other facilities which exist are totally different from what was available ten, 15, 20 or 30 years ago. With regard to pastoral care and mental health in a school environment - particularly in post-primary schools, which is what we are discussing - in the health document published by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, she clearly articulated that the mental health of the school community is the responsibility of everybody in the school community and that everybody should feel empowered. If somebody is in an unhappy place, which could lead to very tragic circumstances, the potential victim or sufferer should feel comfortable enough to be able to articulate his or her concerns in the first instance to any member of the school community or to a friend and tell someone he or she is feeling very depressed. The person told should feel empowered to say to the guidance counsellor that the first person is feeling very depressed, or should be seen to, and in turn the guidance counsellor, who is not a qualified psychiatrist or health worker per se but who has very clear skills, should be able to refer the person to a proper professional service. In light of many of the tragedies we have had in schools recently - we are all aware of them - the health of the school community and the young people in it in particular must be more than just one person's responsibility. This was the message very clearly sent out by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. Some people felt this was an intrusion into their area, although this is not true of all guidance counsellors. We must recognise that young people in particular suffer through cyberbullying and a host of other issues, and we have had great tragedies, including very poignant tragedies in Deputy McConalogue's constituency. We must make it the responsibility of more than just one person.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22305	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	I move amendment No. 2:In page 9, lines 26 to 28, to delete all words from and including "in" where it secondly occurs in line 26 down to and including "superannuation" in line 28 and substitute the following:"upon and subject to such terms and conditions as are not less favourable to him or her than the terms and conditions in relation to the grant of such benefits under the superannuation scheme or arrangement".These amendments relate to the pension conditions and clarify the terms. Under the Industrial Development Act 1993 and related legislation, Forfás is statutorily the employer of staff in Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. These staff are employed by Forfás and seconded to the individual agencies. Parts 2 to 4 of the Bill make provision for Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland to become employers of their own staff, and Forfás staff currently on secondment to these agencies will become employees of their respective agency. The Bill provides for each agency to establish new pension schemes in respect of staff transferring from Forfás. Amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 7 strengthen the language used in the original Bill with regard to confirming that staff who transfer to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland will do so on no less favourable conditions of superannuation than applied under the superannuation scheme from which they are transferring. Sections 7, 10 and 13, respectively, provide for Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland to establish new superannuation schemes in respect of staff transferring from Forfás to each of the agencies under sections 6(1), 9(1) and 12(1). It is proposed to delete the phrase relating to exercise of "discretion" through amendments Nos. 3, 5 and 8, as the new superannuation schemes to be established by these agencies, which the transferred staff will join, will include provision for the exercise of discretion by the employer.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22305	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	I can certainly confirm that there is no diminution of pension entitlements.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	Section 41 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 requires the Garda Commissioner to keep the Minister and the Secretary General informed of a range of matter under four categories, namely, (i) significant developments concerning the preservation of peace and public order in the State, the protection of life and property in the State, and the protection of the security of the State; (ii) significant developments that might reasonably be expected to affect adversely public confidence in the Garda Síochána; (iii) matters relevant to the accountability of the Government to the Houses of the Oireachtas; and (iv) any other matters that, in the Commissioner's opinion, should be brought to the Minister's attention. The purpose and effect of section 41, therefore, is to put in place a statutory framework for the provision of information by the Commissioner to the Secretary General and the Minister. A very wide range of information is provided by the Commissioner which would be covered by this section, ranging from updates on crime and security matters to the provision of material to enable the Minister to answer questions in Dáil Éireann (information of a type which in practice would have been previously provided before the enactment of section 41). In many, if not most, cases information which is supplied by the Commissioner, and which fall within the scope of section 41, might not be specifically expressed to be a communication under section 41. It is therefore not reasonably practicable to give details of the number of such communications.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22305	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	103	I move amendment No. 10:In page 22, line 34, to delete “Every” and substitute “Subject to subsection (2), every”.These amendments pertain to clarifying ministerial responsibilities for pensions. The existing section 25 provides for the Minister to become responsible for the existing superannuation schemes of the dissolved body. A new subsection (2) is to be included in the Bill, which qualifies the provision of section 25 where a scheme or arrangement in respect of superannuation may not have been approved by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform or any other Minister of the Government whose consent was required but not obtained. Section 19 of the Bill provides for the transfer of Forfás functions to the Minister and as such, the text, which is to be deleted by amendment No. 11, is superfluous. Amendment No. 12 introduces a new subsection (2), which provides that the provisions of the existing section 25, which shall now become section 25(1), if agreed, shall not apply where a scheme or arrangement in respect of superannuation may not have been approved by a relevant Minister. Amendment No. 10 qualifies the existing section 25 by making it subject to the provisions of the new subsection (2) that is to be inserted. Section 25 will now read as follows:
Superannuation schemes administered by dissolved body
25(1) Subject to subsection (2), every scheme or arrangement in relation to superannuation administered by the dissolved body immediately prior to the dissolution day shall, on and after the dissolution day, continue in force as if made by the Minister.(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply in relation to a provision of a scheme or arrangement in relation to superannuation in respect of which the consent or approval of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform or any other Minister of the Government was required by or under any enactment but not obtained.This is, in a sense, a safety provision. There is no term to which it is believed this provision applies.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22305	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	I move amendment No. 13:In page 22, after line 38, to insert the following:
“Administration of superannuation scheme or arrangement by relevant body on behalf of Minister
26. (1) The Minister may, for the purposes of this section, designate in writing a superannuation scheme or arrangement (in this section referred to as a “designated scheme or arrangement”) referred to in—(a) section 25, or(b) subsection (5)(c) of section 12 of the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act 2014.(2) The Minister may require a relevant body to carry out, on his or her behalf, such pension administration services as the Minister may specify in writing in relation to a designated scheme or arrangement.(3) A relevant body shall, when required by the Minister to do so, carry out such pension administration services as the Minister specifies in writing under subsection (2) in relation to a designated scheme or arrangement.(4) The Minister may give directions in writing to a relevant body in relation to any pension administration service specified by him or her under subsection (2).(5) A relevant body shall comply with any directions given by the Minister under subsection (4).(6) Where the Minister requires a relevant body to carry out the pension administration service specified in paragraph (b) of subsection (8) in relation to a designated scheme or arrangement, the Minister shall, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, out of monies provided by the Oireachtas, provide the relevant body with a sum of money equal to the total amount of the benefits due under that paragraph to enable that body to make such payment.(7) A relevant body shall provide such information to the Minister, relating to pension administration services which the body carries out under subsection (3), as the Minister may from time to time require.(8) In this section—“pension administration service” means, in relation to a designated scheme or arrangement—(a) calculation of any superannuation benefit payable to, or in respect of, any member of that scheme or arrangement,(b) payment on behalf of the Minister of any superannuation benefit due to, or in respect of, any member of that scheme or arrangement to the member or other person concerned,(c) maintenance of records relating to, or in respect of, members of that scheme or arrangement, or(d) such other service as may be specified in writing by the Minister for the purposes of administering that scheme or arrangement on his or her behalf;“relevant body” means—(a) Enterprise Ireland,(b) IDA,(c) Science Foundation Ireland, or(d) the National Standards Authority of Ireland.”.This amendment provides for the inclusion of a new section. It is providing that administration services in respect of superannuation will go from Forfás not to my Department but to a body of my choosing, which will be Enterprise Ireland. It also provides for the administration of pensions in respect of local enterprise offices, LEOs. I will provide the full explanation. At present, Forfás carries out the administration function for the superannuation schemes for which it has responsibility. The existing section 25 of the Bill provides for the Minister to become responsible for the existing superannuation schemes of the dissolved body. The Minister also is responsible for the pension schemes arising under section 12(5)(c) of the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act 2014. It is proposed that when the Minister assumes responsibility for these schemes, the administration function will be devolved to a relevant body - that is, an agency of the Department as defined in this proposed new section 26. This section provides for the Minister to require a relevant body to carry out such administration services on his or her behalf and sets out the arrangements to apply in this regard. As I indicated, it will be Enterprise Ireland.

It is an important reform of which, while on the benches opposite, I was always a keen advocate. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation requires an internal policy capability and this measure will facilitate the development of that.

I thank Members for their support.

I always thought it very strange that there was no economist available within the Department. The former Minister, Batt O'Keeffe, made some arrangements in that respect. However, Forfás did much very good work for the State in the 20 years or so of its existence. It produced a great number of reports and I thank all those who served Forfás at staff and board level. However, it is most important that the policy function of the Department, as well as the policy function that now is moving into the Department, still will retain the ability to challenge the Department and the Government on economic policy in the manner in which Forfás has done. If this ability becomes neutered in any way, I will be the first to call the Minister out on it.

Human rights, justice and equality concern themselves with the proper ordering of things and citizens within society. Equality and human rights are two sides of the same coin. One cannot block equality for people in society because all citizens deserve to be treated equally. This Bill will bring about a safer, fairer and stronger Ireland. I am in favour of tolerance and compromise when conflicts arise. Religious beliefs divided this country for too long. It is only in the past 20 years or so that we have come to recognise that religious belief is a matter of personal conscience, not a concern of government. We all have natural rights and this Bill, when implemented, will work for the common good and will protect and promote human rights and equality. In bygone days, to be free was not to be a slave with someone else having legal guaranteed control over one's person. This is still its essential meaning. To be free means that one is not prevented from doing what one wants to do and not forced to do what one dislikes doing. Any limitation of this twofold power is an interference with freedom and human rights. It may well be that to interfere with the freedom of some people prevents their interfering with somebody else and is, therefore, a guarantee of the latter's freedom. This Bill will merge the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission. It is also a measure to streamline government by making it smaller, leaner and cheaper to run and giving better value to the general public from our scarce available resources. It will also end the overlapping roles of both bodies. Our programme for Government proposed getting rid of many of the overlapping agencies. This Bill recognises and seeks to implement an important judgment of the European Court of Human Rights by amending the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 to provide for an enforceable right to compensation for a person found to be unlawfully deprived of his or her liberty as a result of a judicial act. A smaller and more streamlined body will be able to more effectively and efficiently champion human rights. When Fine Gael entered government we introduced important human rights legislation, the Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Act, which protects home owners who use reasonable force in self-defence. This has provided legal certainty and clarity on the issue of home defence. It also put an end to the scenario of injured trespassers suing home owners. It provides that the home owner or occupant of a home is no longer obliged to retreat when confronting an intruder or trespasser. In my opinion, this is equally a human right for our people. We have brought legal certainty to an area where serious confusion existed. I was delighted that we acted on this issue when we came into government because up until 2012 the home owner was very vulnerable when faced with intruders. It is a basic human right to protect one's home and family. The natural equality of men and women is one of the essential principles of natural law; no law is more fundamental than that of the natural equality of people. Natural equality is that which exists between all men by the very constitution of their nature. I was delighted to serve on the Constitutional Convention, which gave citizens a direct voice on a range of issues. I hope the convention's deliberations will bring about reforms to our Constitution, particularly in the areas of human rights and equality issues, all for the betterment of our society. Natural equality is founded upon that human nature which is common to all humans who are born, grow, live and die in the same way. Therefore, each of us must treat others as equal to him- or herself. The consequence is that all men and women are naturally free; that we are to treat our inferiors in rank as our equals by nature; and that no one may claim any particular right above that right of others unless he or she has acquired it other than by birth or wealth. Equality means an absence of legal discrimination against any one individual, group, class or race. It means equal claims to a minimum standard of education, housing and food and a guarantee against economic insecurity - in other words, a recognition that there can be no difference inherent in nature between the claims of man and woman to happiness - and, especially, that no one person or group may be sacrificed to another. As a human being I deplore the violation of human rights in any shape or form, whether it be here or in any other part of the world. As a politician my concern is focused on human rights issues and by extension I am fully supportive of the establishment of the democratic process around the world. I refer to conflict in the Middle East and the current situation in Ukraine. Democracy must reign in those areas. In this historic week when the last remaining vestiges of dissent between Ireland and Britain are being put to rest, I do not propose to dwell on the causes or details of our 800 years of struggle for freedom in this country, particularly during the Famine years. State visits such as this highlight awareness of the civil, political, economic and social rights of those who were victims of human rights abuses over the centuries. It is essential that we have exchanges or visits such as this among leaders in order to address issues, including human rights issues and concerns, by encouraging better communications between nations. I thank the Minister, Deputy Shatter, for introducing the gender equality Bill, which provides that women and men have an equal right to participate in politics without discrimination. The gender quotas will bring more women into the political system, although my former constituency colleague, former Deputy Mary O'Rourke, would have disagreed with this measure. The concern of all free people must be to address the human rights and welfare of children, adults and all those who are exploited by the forces of war, oppression and wrongdoing.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate. I will deal in particular with the human rights of people with disabilities. I will compare international law with the situation in Ireland. Under international law, Ireland has a responsibility towards everyone under its jurisdiction. These international obligations exist in addition to those in Ireland's domestic law and the 1937 Constitution. Where there is a conflict, international law is superior. Even if international standards are not expressly reflected in domestic law, they are binding on states once they are ratified. Each general international human rights instrument protects the rights of persons with mental illness through the principle of equality and non-discrimination. More specific standards exist with regard to people with mental illness. The primary source of international human rights under the United Nations system is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is frequently quoted and which encompasses civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.Civil and political rights, including the right to liberty, a fair trial and to vote, were subsequently laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which I will refer, and the committee of experts was established to oversee its implementation in national jurisdictions. Economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to an adequate standard of living, the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and an education, were laid down in the second binding treaty, namely, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and a similar supervisory committee was established, namely, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. These UN committees are supported by the UN High Commission for Human Rights which also issues comments that are instructive. Other treaties are of relevance. For example, the UN Commission on the Rights of the Child, often quoted in this House, carries certain additional obligations. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states the obligation on states parties to the covenant to promote progressive realisation of the relevant rights to the maximum of their available resources clearly requires governments to do much more than merely abstain from taking measures that might have a negative impact on persons with disabilities. The obligation in the case of such a vulnerable and disadvantaged group is to take positive action to reduce structural disadvantage and give appropriate preferential treatment to people with disabilities in order to achieve the objectives of full participation and equality within society for all persons with disabilities. That almost invariably means that additional resources will need to be made available for that purpose and that a wide range of specially tailored measures will be required. The UN principles for the protection of persons with a mental illness and the improvement of mental health care, known as the MI principles, were adopted in 1991 and state elaborate and basic rights and freedoms of people with a mental illness must be secured if states are to be fully compliant. Many of the rights included in both covenants, including the UN instruments, include such measures as standard rules for the equalisation of opportunities for persons with disabilities, a declaration on the rights of mentally retarded persons, a declaration on the rights of disabled persons and the UN body of principles for the protection of all persons in any form of detention or imprisonment. The relevant principle in regard to the rights of people with a mental illness is Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides for the rights of everybody to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health and identifies some of the measures states should take "to achieve a full realisation of these rights". The MI principles to which I referred apply to all persons with a mental illness, regardless of whether they are in inpatient psychiatric care, and to all persons admitted to psychiatric facilities, regardless of whether they are diagnosed as having a mental illness. They provide criteria for the determination of mental illness, the protection of confidentiality, standards of care, the rights of people in mental health facilities and the provision of resources. MI principle 1 lays down the basic foundations on which states' obligations towards people with a mental illness are built. It states all persons with a mental illness or who are being treated as such shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and shall have the right to exercise all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights as recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In addition to the UN mechanism, Ireland is bound by certain human rights principles laid down by the Council of Europe. There is a regional system of international human rights law comprising 43 states throughout Europe. Chief among the Council of Europe's treaties is the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Another is the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which pertains specifically to places of detention. It has an expert committee, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Ireland's treatment of people with a mental illness is part of a wider pattern of discrimination against people with disabilities. Amnesty International uses the term "persons with disabilities" in accordance with contemporary UN usage which defines disability as summarising a great number of functional limitations occurring in any population in any country of the world. People may be disabled by physical, intellectual or sensory impairment, medical conditions or a mental illness. In general, Ireland's treatment of people with disabilities is often at variance with international standards. The concluding observations in the report of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on Ireland's second periodical review were critical of Ireland's treatment of people with disabilities. It remarked on the persistence of discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, especially in the fields of employment, social security benefit, education and health, and expressed concern that the principles of non-discrimination and equal access to health facilities and services were not embodied in the national mental health strategy. The Minister might comment on the Government's declared position on the repeal of the Mental Health Act 2001 in regard to criticisms of it and the need to have it upgraded. I will raise that issue in a different forum at a later stage, probably in a Topical Issue debate.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	I think I am sharing with Deputy Mick Wallace, but if he does not turn up, I will soldier on regardless. The merging of the two bodies is important. This gives us an important opportunity to focus on how this country can promote human rights and equality, which is critical, but we have to take a step back in that regard. Talking about equality is welcome, but we need to have the resources to back it up.  I will begin by referring to rights and supports for people with disabilities. We have seen many references to this issue on paper, while, simultaneously, decisions are being made in the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills and so on which adversely impact on the lives of disabled citizens and prevent them from having an equal stake in society. I will give two examples, the first of which is the Gateway scheme which is a slave labour, chain gang type facility to make up for the fact that local authority jobs are being eroded. Thousands have been lost in the past few years. Traditionally, local authorities provided for and held a substantial number of positions for people with disabilities, members of the Traveller community and so on, people in our society who would otherwise be discriminated against, to give them an equal opportunity. As a result of jobs no longer being available in local authorities, people are unable to access their right to employment. That is a substantial step back.  I am aware that many disabled citizens who rely on personal assistance have seen their hours cut and not replaced. That is reprehensible. It is all very well to talk the talk, but we need to deliver on the issue of resources.There are particular groups in society which need our protection when we refer to human rights. One that has been alluded to is the Traveller community. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, ECRI, report from one year ago noted that Ireland had a legislative weakness in dealing with the issue of racial profiling and suggested it introduce legislation to deal with it. It stated it would check on our progress in this regard in the near future. The report also noted that stronger efforts were needed in the area of Traveller-Roma accommodation, with the need for Ireland to introduce measures binding on local authorities in Traveller accommodation provision. This is an area that needs to be beefed up. The way in which we respond to issues which some of the more vulnerable sectors of society experience dictates how these groups feel they are valued. The iReport facility is a reporting system for people, communities and organisations in Ireland to document serious incidents of a racist character which occur against citizens, those not born in Ireland and members of the Traveller community. If we were really serious about equality and human rights, we would address these issues. Sometimes racist issues arise, but how the State responds to them can often be more hurtful. Some of the accounts collected by the iReport organisation of how gardaí respond to racist incidents have been shocking, with very few being explored properly. For example, only one out of 100 victims can verify that they have been in receipt of an incident number and that there has been a proper investigation. The poor level of communication adds to the upset and confusion for victims. For example, gardaí told a white man reporting a car break-in that Travellers were probably responsible for the crime before they conducted an investigation into it. Another incident recounted a scenario where a garda, in questioning walkers at a popular tourist site, asked one man very aggressively about car break-ins when he learned that the man’s name was synonymous with the Traveller community. A Traveller family visiting a Garda station to request a stamp on their forms found the gardaí laughing and joking while stamping their children’s hands. They felt very degraded by that experience. The Minister is aware that Traveller children's details have been entered on the Garda PULSE system, causing upset to their families. Despite the denials by the former Garda Commissioner that there was no racial profiling by the Garda, external bodies and proof from the PULSE system indicates that there is. This is not just a serious erosion of human rights or degradation of citizens but will also add to problems in the future. Several weeks ago I spent a Sunday afternoon in Rathkeale with some members of the Traveller community. I met one man, a successful businessman, who admitted one or two members of his family previously had been involved with the Garda not in a good way. He himself was a law-abiding citizen who had never had any problems with the law. His home was broken into in a violent armed robbery during which his family was held at gunpoint, while he was beaten in front of his grandchildren. The Garda did not investigate that robbery because, in their opinion, the family were members of the Traveller community. The gang went on to rob other families in the area and were eventually caught. Subsequent to this, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, conducted a raid on this man's property. Again, the family was held at gunpoint, but this time there were no men present, just a granny, a mother and some grandchildren. One young boy faced armed gardaí from the CAB with helmets and torches, feeling his grandparent and mother was going to be shot. He thought it was the same burglars back again. The family had property taken from them which was later shown on television with a slogan saying, “proceeds from criminal activity”. I saw the property, the painting etc. It was returned to the family. It had not been misappropriated and was the family's own personal property. This family was tarred, vilified and demonised simply because they were members of the Traveller community. It is these antics that alienate generation after generation. The ten year old boy who witnessed his family being held at gunpoint will not respect the Garda anymore, nor will his uncle who was stopped on a laneway and beaten up by gardaí for no valid reason. Unless we start to look seriously at measures to protect some of the most vulnerable groups in society, talk about merging human rights and equality organisations is simply that, talk. We need to educate all facets of the State in their dealings with minority groups. The worst case of this was the taking of the Roma children earlier this year, which is the subject of an inquiry. We need to respond far more seriously to these actions. The Minister needs to do more with the PULSE inquiry that has been established. We are alienating generations of the population. Apart from the appalling indictment that they lack basic human rights standards, Travellers and the Roma population are among the most excluded members of our society. Another issue on which we need to deliver is women’s access to abortion services. Ireland has been rightly criticised for its violation of women’s human rights because of its lack of appropriate legislation on abortion. Last year we passed weak and appalling legislation which was supposed to give protection in law to a pregnant woman whose life might have been in danger by allowing her access to a termination. That law falls well short of that intention. Critically, it excludes that group of women who tragically discover their foetus has a fatal abnormality not compatible with life. Former Attorneys General have advised the State that this group potentially has a right to secure an abortion in Ireland by arguing in the European court that those women who had taken cases to the European court had not exploited all domestic avenues before doing so, thereby implying that had they done so, a hearing would have been granted, even within the confines of the Constitution, yet the Government has failed in the past year to legislate to allow abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities which, to my mind, is degrading, inhuman and a gross violation of people’s human rights. Unlike former Ministers, the Minister is on top of his brief in what goes on in prisons and the case of prisoners. It is welcome that the phasing out of slopping out in prisons is under way. I accept that this will take time, but I am surprised, given the Minister’s knowledge, that he has stood over multi-cell occupancy, which is a degradation of human rights. We should not force people to share a prison cell. It is not good for the staff or prisoners themselves. If we are to advance as a state in protecting human rights, we need to address these concerns, not just talk about them.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	I have not had as much time as I would have liked to go through the Bill. The merging of the two bodies was cited last week in the Government’s amendment to the motion of no confidence in the Minister. This disappointing Bill could have been more progressive and reforming. Improvements have been made to the first draft provided in 2012.The Bill lacks substance if it is to provide properly for the protection and strengthening of human rights structures within the State. The independence of the proposed statutory body from the Government is questionable, particularly in view of the procedures set out in sections 13 and 14 regarding the appointment of the commissioners. Section 13 provides that the Government will hold a veto on the appointment of those selected for the position of commissioner by the Public Appointments Service. Section 14 allows the Government to remove a member of the commission under a broad range of circumstances. These provisions compromise the independence of these appointments and run contrary to the spirit of the UN Paris Principles. Under those principles, autonomy from Government is strong, particularly in regard to funding and appointment of commissioners. Section 26 sets out how funding will be allocated by the Oireachtas and leaves this decision entirely to the discretion of the Minister, subject to input from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Irish Human Rights Commission's submission notes that in order for the commission to be properly independent, in accordance with the UN Paris Principles, it should have autonomous control over its budget and the amount allocated to it should be what is reasonably sufficient in the eyes of the commission, rather than as set out in section 26 currently - what is reasonably sufficient in the eyes of the Minister. Section 42 introduces a positive duty for public bodies to have due regard to human rights and equality, and the commission is to assist public bodies to comply with this positive duty by producing guidelines and codes of practice and by review and the making of recommendations. In light of this new and additional task for the proposed commission and the range of public bodies that would be covered, it would seem an increase in resources will be necessary. I would appreciate it if the Minister would commit to this in the House as a demonstration of a real, meaningful and measurable commitment to the new commission and to the importance and priority of human rights within the Administration. It should also be noted that the Irish Human Rights Commission believes that section 42 should be reviewed and strengthened. This may be a legal obligation, in accordance with the principle of equivalence in the Good Friday Agreement. For example, there are no provisions to enforce compliance with this duty. I have looked at the Irish Human Rights Commission's notes on this Bill. It points out that section 35 provides for inquiries to be conducted at the discretion of the commission or by direction of the Minister for Justice and Equality, with complex procedures prescribed for the holding of an inquiry set out in Schedule 2 of the Bill. The explanatory memorandum states that the inquiry function has been redesigned and modelled on that contained in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 to ensure it is robust and effective in practice. It is recalled that the Paris Principles call for national human rights institutions, NHRIs, to have functional independence from government. In this regard, the IHRC, or IHREC designate, recommends that its inquiry function should not be the subject of direction from a Minister, despite the fact that the IHREC would be independent in the conduct of any inquiry thereafter. Section 35 also sets a high threshold for the decision to conduct an inquiry in so far as there must be evidence of either a serious violation of human rights or equality of treatment obligations or a systemic failure to comply with human rights or equality of treatment obligations, the matter must be of grave public concern, and it must be, in the circumstances, necessary and appropriate so to do. The IHRC recommends that the threshold for the holding of an inquiry be lowered and brought into line with the agreement, under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which requires only that the matter to be investigated be of significant public concern. It may be expected that inquiries conducted by the commission will not be routine, in light of the resource implications of such an undertaking. The requirement that there must already be evidence of a serious violation of human rights or equality of treatment obligations before the inquiry commences begs the question of the purpose of the inquiry. The requirement that a matter be of grave public concern could preclude an inquiry into a hidden violation - for example, the Magdalen laundries, a confidential communication from a whistleblower not already in the public domain or a matter than affects only a limited group of people but none the less has significant implications for human rights and equality compliance. Furthermore, the commission recommends that it should not be precluded from considering broader human rights standards than those obtaining under domestic law when conducting inquiries. In this regard, I point out that the three inquiries undertaken by the IHRC to date examined international human rights law standards and were not the subject of any judicial review or other legal proceedings.  A clear distinction should be made in this Bill between the narrative value of an inquiry report to document any failure to uphold human rights and equality standards by a public body or Department and any enforcement proceedings resulting from an inquiry which, by necessity, could only refer to human rights and equality standards with force of law. The application of a narrow definition of human rights to inquiries fails to distinguish between the value of an inquiry to prompt a change in law and practice for the future and those aspects of an inquiry which could possibly lead to enforcement action. At a minimum, it is recommended that a clause be inserted in the Bill that the IHREC is not precluded from referring to the definition of human rights under Part 2 of the Bill in the course of conducting and preparing a report on an inquiry, even if it is considered necessary to provide that the narrower definition applies in regard to any enforcement action arising therefrom. I want to raise an issue we raised before. We hoped the terms of reference introduced yesterday, which are welcome and are strong regarding the taping issue, would have included whatever recommendations arise from the Judge Cooke and Seán Guerin reports, so that we can be confident of getting to the truth of the issues involved. Likewise, we raised the issue of racial profiling within the Garda force with the Minister previously. He said that he was content with the Garda Commissioner's guarantee that this did not happen, but this is an issue the Minister should consider further. He says he wants things to be done better within the force and that some areas need to be examined. This is definitely one area the Minister should consider looking at, because it is important for the force that the people are satisfied on this issue. If racial profiling is taking place, we need to address this problem, and if we want to find out for sure whether it is taking place, we must investigate the issue properly. It would be good to include this in the latest investigation.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	118	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill 2014 and thank the Minister for introducing it to the House. I welcome the Bill. There has been significant debate in various European countries over whether it is appropriate to merge an equality body and a human rights institution. There are two sides to the argument, but some countries that have already done this have seen strong advantages in terms of developing a comprehensive approach to both equality and human rights and preventing any risk of fragmentation. I believe the idea of merging the two bodies and bringing them together under one commission with real teeth is a welcome development. This is just one of the latest areas the Minister has reformed in the context of ensuring equality and better treatment of need in equality in this country. One area of change for which the Minister will always be remembered here is the citizenship ceremony. I was honoured to attend one of these ceremonies in the Convention Centre with the Minister some months ago and saw how this new ceremony has transformed the purpose of citizenship and given a status to citizenship for new citizens. Just compare this with what we had previously, when new citizens had to sit at the back of a court, with criminals and potential criminals, and wait to be called up in front of a judge. That was not the "Céad míle fáilte" this country is known for. The change to a citizenship ceremony is welcome. I also commend the work done by the Minister during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the area of equality and human rights and the tackling of hate crimes, racism, xenophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism. This work has borne fruit, as can be seen now from the Council conclusions during the Irish Presidency and, most recently, the Commission's communication on this issue, which will put a new framework in place in terms of how European countries can work together to tackle issues such as inequality, hate crime, racism, xenophobia and homophobia.While many politicians talk about inequality, anti-Semitism or being discriminated against, the Minister has obviously experienced it in a very real, disgusting, intolerable and unacceptable way in recent days. This Bill is very welcome and I will focus on one of the grounds listed in equality legislation, namely disability. For far too long this State, regardless of who is in government and which element of bureaucracy is at play, our approach to people with disabilities is to provide them with a social welfare cheque. That is both economically stupid and morally reprehensible. Although so many people with disabilities want to work and play their part in society, and they have a major part to play, we have been far too slow to ensure they can access the workplace. I hope we can focus on this as a government. Today is national job shadow day with the Irish Association of Supported Employment and I am delighted to be joined in the Visitors Gallery by a young man, Conor Coffey, who is shadowing me for the day. He epitomises the message that there are so many people with disabilities who have a role to play. For far too long, general elections have come and gone. The first politician who knocks on the door promises, if elected, to increase the disability allowance by €5, the next promises to increase it by €5.50. Although money matters, it misses the broad point that this country has consistently failed to put structures in place to enable people with disabilities to access the workforce. That is a clear breach of their human rights and entitlement to equality in this Republic. While I welcome the work being done in this area and the Minister's Department by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, we need a supported employment strategy. We need to help people with disabilities access the workforce and play their part. I urge the Minister to do that. Some of Deputy Clare Daly's points on disability were correct and we need to heed them. Up to last year, special needs education policy had not been reviewed since 1993. We went through all the years of economic boom and threw lots of money, some of it badly needed, into special needs education, but we never stopped and asked whether the structures were correct. This Government is trying to untangle that. When we consider equality issues - and I am taking the example of disability - we need to see it as a cross-governmental and cross-departmental effort. We need to move beyond that politically-driven and media-driven argument that everything comes back to euro and cent. If that were the case, people with disabilities would have had all their challenges overcome during the Celtic tiger years. They did not because we were so obsessed with just funding levels rather than asking what we were funding and whether structures were adequate. The Minister is trying to rectify that by examining two agencies that have served this country well but are no longer fit for purpose and the times in which we live, and by bringing them together in a streamlined fashion to deliver a better structure regarding human rights and equality. We need to examine a range of legislation where the language in place is stigmatising, offensive, outdated and disgusting. The Minister has done great work on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, which will finally remove the horrendous Lunacy Act from our Statute Book and replace it with modern legislation and wording. There is more to be done. I am a co-author of the cross-party Mental Health (Anti-Discrimination) Bill which has support from members of all parties and the independent group in this House and which examines the stigmatising language across a range of Acts passed by these Houses in the past. For example, a person with a mental illness cannot win the national lottery, access credit, access insurance or be a Member of this House. These are the sort of laws that remain on our Statute Book in 21st century Ireland. Let us establish a new human rights and equality commission and continue with the reforming zeal the Minister has shown in this area. Let us also look across all the silos that operate in our bureaucracy where there is still stigmatising language in place which contributes to inequality and a breach of people's human rights. The Minister is very conscious of direct provision and he and his Department have been working on reducing the number of people in direct provision and the length of time people spend in it. Direct provision is an abhorrent practice. It was meant to be a very short-term provision for dealing with people seeking asylum in our country. However childhoods are being lost in direct provision. Children are spending their entire childhoods in direct provision. The only people benefiting are private operators, which are funded by taxpayers. I raised this issue with the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality at the Committee of Public Accounts a number of weeks ago and I know the Minister and his Department are working on it. On the membership of the human rights and equality commission I ask the Minister to consider the very important mantra, "nothing about us without us". While I welcome the fact that the membership will have gender equality, in the past we have heard service providers speaking on behalf of people with disabilities rather than hearing from people with disabilities. There is an advisory group, and that is welcome. The Minister does not want to be too prescriptive about narrowing the pool of people who can serve on the commission and I respect that. We need our best and brightest. However we also need people who can talk about some of these issues based on their direct life experiences rather than just abstract concepts. I ask the Minister to consider that. This is another step forward in reforming an area that badly needs reform. We cannot become complacent. In recent days and weeks there have been a number of attacks and assaults on people's liberties and breaches of various equality legislation. I very much welcome the Government's commitment to hold a referendum on marriage equality next year. I look forward to actively supporting that and campaigning in favour of it and I welcome the Minister's personal commitment to that issue. I encourage the Minister to continue to do what he is doing in Europe in terms of examining how we can work together in a pan-European way to learn from each other about how we deal with equality and human rights. I commend the legislation to the House and ask that the Minister note my comments.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	It has been this Government's desire and stated objective to amalgamate many institutions and organisations. There was a rush to talk about quangos. When amalgamating, it is incredibly important to get the fit right. From the outset I have had difficulty with this proposed amalgamation. It will happen, and I am concerned that the new organisation does not lose focus on the critically important individual elements. There is little point in having good legislation without the means to enforce that legislation, where sanctions cannot be applied where there is offence, or cases cannot be taken because the organisation lacks the capacity to do so. Others have made this criticism and the Minister probably did when he was in opposition, and he probably supports the idea. Regarding equality there is anecdotal evidence of substantial delays and people not having a hearing at all. It is important that there be an understanding that if we have legislation we must have the resources to implement it. Although many of the resources that have been stripped away from both these organisations were taken under the previous Government, it has not been reversed. The capacity to deal with the workload must be examined. The other issue of critical importance is independence from the Government, as we constantly speak about the Oireachtas having responsibility but, in reality, it is the Government that retains a significant amount of power. There is an issue regarding how the Oireachtas functions. I have a number of observations but I first pay tribute to Mr. Niall Crowley, who was incredibly concerned about the extent of cutbacks and the ability of organisations to function, as well as the importance of the work done by these bodies. I applaud his courageous decision to resign and take up the cause of organising a civil society response. There are a number of questions to be asked. There is a concern that the new body may not even meet the standards as set out by the 1993 Paris Principles for human rights institutions. Will the Minister address this issue in his response? Was there dialogue and what consideration was given in that area? I would like to be satisfied that the issue received considerable attention. There is a concern about the commission not being able to appoint a chairman or board, and this matter has already been raised by others. Will the Minister give a direct response on how the process will come about? The positioning in the Department of Justice and Equality is the wrong fit and I would rather see it placed in a Department responsible for communities, with separation from the law enforcement side of the State. What consideration was given to the positioning of this new organisation? There is much criticism that the definition of equality is too narrow. We do not want a case where the organisation cannot pursue matters through the courts because of a narrow definition, so the issue should be addressed. There is often a trade-off between inclusiveness and efficiency, and this is one area where such a trade-off is not safe. The amalgamation is, first and foremost, about saving money but the effectiveness of the organisation must be based on it being an inclusive model. What thought went into that process? Other Deputies have noted the threshold for commencing an inquiry under section 35 of this Bill is very high and the language requires serious violation of human rights or equality provisions, or a systematic failure to comply with human rights or equality provisions. I am not sure what cases are likely to succeed or how that definition will be adjudicated. It is incredibly important that this is made clear to people or otherwise they will refrain from taking cases or seeing this authority as a viable route for complaints. There are flaws in this legislation but good legislation requires the resources to carry it through. There are major examples through various Departments over decades of legislation that exists in theory but whose provisions are not evident in practice. There must be a robust assessment of legislation when it is enacted to ensure it does what is intended in carrying out functions. This is very much a case in point.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	I thought some of the Members opposite were going to contribute as they are in the House. I thank all those who contributed to a very important debate on an important piece of legislation. I will start where I finished in my contribution yesterday evening by saying we want the best possible piece of legislation enacted and we are open to constructive suggestions as to how the legislation might be improved. I hope Members will forgive me if I do not give instant responses to some of what has been stated in the House as I want to reflect on the contributions made by Deputies with regard to the legislation and consider on Committee Stage any necessary amendments, including those which may be tabled from the Opposition. It is important to recall certain basic principles regarding the legislation and some of the substance of the Bill before the House in the context of the comments made. I appreciate not all Members of the House may have had the opportunity to yet consider the speech I delivered yesterday evening. This is a very important piece of legislation and I regard it as a landmark piece of legislation regarding human rights and equality issues. We should never forget, of course, that the context of human rights is reflected in our Constitution and our courts play a role in protecting the rights of individuals. There is also the context of the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights based in Strasbourg, which also plays a particular role. Nevertheless, it is the job of the national human rights agency and the equality agency to ensure that in a broad range of areas the Government respects human rights of individuals and action is taken where necessary to address issues or when individuals are at risk of discrimination. At the core of this Bill is the fact that we have two bodies, the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority, which undertook very important work effectively in their independent silos, with some of the work overlapping. When we considered the manner in which they approached the work in both bodies, which have had excellent membership and staff, the view was that an amalgamated body with extended powers and greater independence than applied to either body with regard to appointment of individuals was desirable. It was also preferable to confer additional functions on the body over and above the functions exercised individually by the two bodies which currently exist, and that resources would be used more wisely if the functions to be assigned to the single body were applied rather than across two individual bodies.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	123	The ongoing situation of people in mortgage arrears is unacceptable, given the scale of the continuing crisis and the hands-off approach of the Government and the Central Bank to the resolution of the issues facing thousands of families, whose entire futures are in jeopardy and whose lives are paralysed by the lack of sustainable solutions. Since Central Bank targets have come into play, approximately 13,000 letters have issued from the AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, initiating the potentially devastating prospect of eviction and repossession. That figure dwarfs all other potential solutions such as loan extensions, interest-only deals or split mortgages. Yesterday representatives of Ulster Bank appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and acknowledged that over 4,000 owner occupiers were in the legal process and admitted frankly that up to 1,500 had a realistic chance of having their homes repossessed. The Taoiseach said some months ago that that was the last resort and something the Government did not want to countenance. The inconsistency of the approach, depending on the lender, is unacceptable. AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB have dramatically different approaches with different outcomes. A person who borrows €200,000 in a split mortgage from AIB could be €57,000 better off than someone with the same mortgage from Bank of Ireland. The difference is extraordinary. It is not acceptable that a customer depends on pot luck, whether with Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB or AIB, which determines that there is a massive difference in how that one option plays out. Eighteen months after the personal insolvency regime was introduced and all of the targets set by the Central Bank, the situation is not satisfactory by any stretch of the imagination and not sustainable for many families. It is time for a fundamental review of the approach to this issue and for the Government and the Central Bank to be far more hands-on, to take a more standardised and consistent approach to the issue of mortgage arrears. 
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	I thank the Deputy for his question. There is no doubt that one of the harshest and dire consequences of the economic collapse from 2008 to 2011 was the indebtedness of many of our fellow citizens, particularly couples who could not afford to pay their mortgages. The Government has addressed this issue with the very strong assistance of the Central Bank. There has been agreement across the House on the approach where the Central Bank set quarterly targets to resolve the issue of impaired mortgages and these are being met. In round terms, sustainable solutions have been put in place for 54,000 households which cannot cope with their mortgage arrears. That is significant progress and I hope progress will continue. That is why I am so pleased that the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has called in all of the main lenders this week and is putting them through their paces. Representatives of Ulster Bank came in yesterday. Representatives of Permanent TSB are in this morning. I understand it states it has offered new arrangements to 60% of its mortgage holders and it seems to be leading in exceeding targets. It is very important that they are met. We will continue to drive them and I know the committee will pressurise the lending institutions to ensure they keep to them.  The other side of indebtedness is the buy-to-let sector, in which the banks have made significant progress. Bank of Ireland claims to have offered solutions to 90% of its buy-to-let customers, while AIB claims it has offered solutions to 65%. It is one of the big problems impinging on couples’ personal lives, many of whom are young. It is a difficult issue and a drag and an inhibition on the economy because people coping with so much personal debt are not fully participating in it. We must continue to drive forward. There is a range of solutions. It is not pot luck. The Central Bank has set down a protocol, set the targets and agreed the range of acceptable solutions. There is a standardisation of approach across the banks. Within the range of options available to the lenders, one bank moves more strongly in one direction than another. There are variations within an agreed scheme. I acknowledge the seriousness of the issue, but steady progress is being made and with everybody’s help, we continue to drive forward.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	The variation is stark. For example, on the split mortgage it is as wide as €57,000. It could not be acceptable that, depending on which bank gave the mortgage, one could be better off by €57,000 in the application of a single option on the split mortgage. It should not be reduced to how lucky one is to happen to have a split mortgage with AIB as opposed to with Bank of Ireland or Permanent TSB. The Minister for Justice and Equality said he would review the personal insolvency regime after 18 months. There have been only four cases. It has had a negligible impact on the mortgage arrears crisis. The Central Bank targets seem to have led to an attack on the mortgagee rather than the crisis. It has led to a ramping-up of legal actions and up to 13,000 legal letters have been sent. They have a terrible impact on families who receive them. That aspect needs to be reviewed. The Minister spoke about cross-party consensus. My colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, made the point at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that it was very worrying that 30% of Ulster Bank’s customers who were in arrears for over 90 days were involved in the legal and repossession process. Deputy Ciarán Lynch who chairs the committee has said Ulster Bank is “very, very opposed to any debt removal that is based on people remaining in their home.” The central objective of the Government as articulated in the House, to protect people in their family homes, is falling apart at the seams. The banks have a very determined focus, in response to the targets, on starting a significant process of repossession. The first bank to appear before the committee yesterday stated that up to 1,500 family homes could be repossessed and that that was a realistic prospect. Is it not time for a more fundamental review of how the Government and the Central Bank have approached this issue, with a view to making the protection of the family home the number one priority in resolving and responding to the difficulties people undoubtedly face?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	126	It is the clear objective of the Government that persons in mortgage distress should continue to live in the family home and that from the range of solutions available, solutions other than repossession should apply. It is also true that unless repossession is part of the legal system, there will be no mortgage market because nobody will lend unless there is legal potential to realise the collateral. It is part of the legal system. The Government’s relationship with each bank differs.

We do, however, have 99% of the shares in AIB and 14% of the shares in Bank of Ireland. I read in this morning’s newspapers what the chief executive of Ulster Bank had said at the committee yesterday. It was not as blunt as Deputy Micheál Martin represented it.What he said was that the purpose of legal letters to many customers was to get them to engage, because solutions cannot be brought forward unless they engage. The purpose was not to proceed to repossession but to get engagement in the process when the letters that had been written previously were being ignored by customers.

It is also our policy that the lending institutions that have entered into agreements with the Central Bank will keep those agreements and meet their targets. To date, they are doing so, and 54,000 permanent solutions have been offered. We will continue to drive that agenda. I am delighted that the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform is scrutinising the progress being made by the lending institutions. Without being harsh on the lending institutions, I am glad that members of the committee are putting pressure on them to continue meeting their targets.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	137	I am one of the members of the committee who is putting pressure on the banks. I do not get up in the morning to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas in order to be misled or lied to by senior bankers, as is happening in committee room 4. I have just come from a meeting with representatives of Permanent TSB, whom I asked about the bank's split mortgage product. They said they do not charge interest rates on the warehoused portion of the product. After I left the meeting I contacted a customer of Permanent TSB, who sent me a copy of a document the bank issued two weeks ago stating that interest would be charged on the customer's warehoused account at a rate of 4.1%. The banks are running rings around this Government and it is time the Minister stepped up to the mark. He should stop hiding behind the Central Bank and its targets and start to rein them in. Last April the Taoiseach told this House that he expected a substantial contribution from the leadership of the banks in respect of pay and pensions. He further stated that it would be right to have such an expectation because these are extraordinary salaries. He made his comments in the context of the Mercer report and at a time when Bank of Ireland was holding its AGM. The Minister was to vote on Richie Boucher's salary. One year later, not one cent of the basic pay of top bankers has been cut on foot of the Mercer report recommendations. In particular, citizens of this State will be shocked to learn that, once again, the CEO of Bank of Ireland, Richie Boucher, has earned an obscene salary-----

We know the total package is €843,000. Bank of Ireland exists only because it was bailed out by citizens of this State. The cost incurred by the taxpayer has been immense. Despite all the hardships endured by ordinary hard-working people across the State, this bank continues to show contempt for them in the way it deals with repossessions and legal letters and its obligation to provide credit to small and medium-sized enterprises. Was the Taoiseach misleading the House when he made his comments last year, or was he misled?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	140	I assume that Bank of Ireland will appear before the committee in the coming days. The Deputy can raise his points directly with the representatives of the banks. I do not know whether the CEO will be appearing but if he is, I am sure he will be anxious to reply to the points raised. Bank salaries were capped at €500,000 by this Government. The arrangements for the CEO of Bank of Ireland were entered into prior to my becoming Minister and they were agreed by my predecessor. We have 14% of Bank of Ireland. It is, by and large, a privately owned bank, and shareholders of privately owned banks tend to award key staff. That is our position on that. The targets set in the Mercer report for savings in the cost base across the banks have been exceeded and it has been a very successful exercise. They used a portfolio of means to meet the targets and these do not all involve salary cuts, even though there have been significant salary cuts. The Mercer targets have been realised, when all the initiatives are taken into account, and the cost base of the main banks has been driven down substantially.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	141	On foot of a freedom of information request to the Department of Finance, I received a copy of the advice given to the Minister in respect of last year's AGM. It was clear that his officials did not want him to vote for the remuneration package of the CEO of Bank of Ireland. They said it would be inappropriate given that he had not received responses on the Mercer report. The Taoiseach stated on that day that the salaries were extraordinary. He expected significant reductions from the leadership of the banks. One year later, we know that not one cent of the basic salary of €843,000 has been reduced. We know that people in Bank of Ireland and other banks have lost their jobs, but at the highest level, not one cent has been taken from salaries. On 25 April, while this House is in recess, the Minister will have the option, on behalf of the Irish people, to cast a vote based on his shareholding in Bank of Ireland. He will have to vote on the resolution to endorse the remuneration packages. Yesterday he told me that he has not yet considered the matter. He needs to do what the Irish people expect from him and what he should have done last year. He needs to say that paying €843,000 to the CEO of Bank of Ireland is obscene at a time when the bank is not dealing with the mortgage crisis appropriately and when Irish people are struggling. As the Minister for Finance, he should not endorse such packages. I ask him to clarify for the House the position he will take in two weeks' time.

We are told the firms bought mortgages that were in arrears. I presume that is because they believe they will get most of their profits from families whose mortgages are in arrears. We do not know the discount at which the loans were sold, but there are a lot of things we do know. We know that sales of this type around the world typically attract discounts of 70%. A mortgage of €250,000 would be sold for approximately €75,000. We know the special liquidator did not ask Oaktree or Loanstar for a binding commitment on adhering to the CCMA. We know there will not be oversight of their voluntary commitments. We know the families were not allowed to bid on their own mortgages. The Minister cited a PwC report on this but he refused to release the report to the Dáil. We have since received a copy of the report from the special liquidator. The Minister has stated that neither he nor any of his officials has had access to the report. The end of the report is quite interesting in that it shows the criteria used to disallow the families from bidding for their own mortgages. What we know from those criteria is that the welfare of these tens of thousands of men, women and children was explicitly excluded from any consideration. Worse than that, we know that when I asked the Government if it would pause the sales process to see if we could find a process that allowed the families to bid and return the same or more money to the State, the answer from the Government was, "No." In short, the Government has sold these men, women and children down the river. I have met some of the families whose mortgages have just been sold to Lone Star and Oaktree. These are people who could have refinanced their mortgages at whatever discount has been given to these US debt firms but now will not, and many of whom will end up being evicted. What does the Minister say to these tens of thousands of men, women and children? What does he say to a family whose mortgage of €250,000 has just been sold to a US debt specialist for €75,000? How does the Minister explain to them that their interests were in no way considered in deciding not to let them bid on their own mortgages?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	152	IBRC was liquidated by a special liquidator who was empowered to do so by special legislation that was brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas and the liquidator acted in accordance with that legislation. His primary mandate was to realise the best possible price for the assets he was disposing in the interests of the State and of the Irish taxpayer. In that context, he made a decision to sell loan books rather than individual loans. That is the advice he got, I understand, from the document that Deputy Donnelly has referred to, and in doing so he succeeded in having a successful sale from the liquidator's perspective. He did not infringe on the rights of any mortgage holder. They have not been disadvantaged in any way by the transfer of their loans to a different owner. He also got assurances from both Lone Star and Oaktree that the protocols that have been put in place by the Central Bank for relationships between lenders and mortgage holders would be honoured. I stated yesterday here in the House that we are preparing legislation to give a legislative base to that. I have sent the heads of the Bill to the Central Bank. I was not in a position to discuss the heads yesterday here in the House because they have not yet been legally proofed by the Attorney General's office, but I intend to have an ongoing dialogue in the finance committee and I will report progress on putting the statutory base under the formal commitments that have been given by the loan book purchasers.

He wrote and forced through here late at night the legislation that stated the Government would not consider the interest of the citizens. The Minister stated in reply to Deputy Pearse Doherty that he does not want to send out a signal to the international markets, to which the Government appears to be in thrall, that there is anything wrong here, yet he has no issue with not sending out a signal to the Irish citizens who elected him and whom he is meant to be looking after. The Minister's position seems to be that we should hope everything works out and they voluntarily comply, but the policy is all about choice. These are the choices the Minister has made: do not consider the interest of the mortgage holders; do not provide the PwC report to the Dáil; do not ask the debt firms for binding commitments; do not provide oversight for how they behave; do not legislation to ensure they behave; do not let families bid on their own mortgages; and shroud everything in secrecy. I am holding up what we got from the special liquidator. We managed to get a few pages with words on them, but most pages, I am sad to say, look like big black squares.

The criteria used were size of the loans, timing constraints, likely credible interest, risks associated with execution of the model, level of interest at the sectoral sector, estimated equity value and performance of the underlying business. In all those wide criteria, nowhere has crept in the interests of the tens of thousands of men, women and children involved. Why, as Minister for Finance, does Deputy Noonan stand over a process that was able to consider many different criteria but somehow was not able to consider the interests of Irish citizens?

Nobody stands up for the taxpayer anymore. Everybody stands up for the individual who has a difficulty. The proposition always being put is that the individual who has a difficulty must be relieved by taking funds from the generality of taxpayers to relieve it. That is the position.

That is the position. It is much easier to present the individual case, but there is a general case as well which I am obliged under law to protect, that is, the protection of the generality of taxpayers so they do not get another bill.

The liquidator was independent in the exercise of his functions. Those who participated in the debate when we brought in the legislation were very anxious that there would be no political interference with the liquidator, and rightly so. The liquidator is carrying out his mandate in accordance with law. It is also true to say no single mortgage holder is worse off because Lone Star or Oaktree has his mortgage than he was when his mortgage was inside in IBRC. He is no worse off, but Deputy Donnelly is making a case that he should be better off and that the taxpayer should pay for it. That is the case Deputy Donnelly is making.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	The Government's proposals vis-à-vis the introduction of universal health insurance are causing considerable concern out there in terms of the implications of such an initiative on people's incomes, additional taxes that will emanate from it and also the lack of detail in terms of the pricing arrangements and the actual packages under which people will be covered. I ask the Minister, in terms of the allocation of Government time for debate, when it is proposed there will be a Dáil debate on this, and to help along the Dáil debate itself, and the public consultations that may ensue, would the Government be open to allowing the views of the Minister for Finance and of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the memorandums that they prepared on this issue, to be published to give people the broadest and most diverse set of perspectives on this policy issue? Given the enormity of the issue, and its importance, that would be a welcome development if the various perspectives of the ministries could be put into the open to facilitate that debate. In terms of the Government's legislative commitment to the introduction of free GP care for the under sixes, I am sure the Minister will be aware that GPs are up in arms, metaphorically speaking.They are very angry at the way they are being treated and undermined. Serious issues are emanating from it. Will the Government indicate when the legislation will be introduced? Is the Government aware of the anger among GPs at what they perceive as the undermining of primary care and the undermining of discretionary medical cards and their removal from needy and sick people?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	I understand the Whips are meeting this afternoon and the item on universal health insurance is one of the items to be discussed. The likelihood is arrangements will be made to have a discussion next week. Regarding free GP care for those under six years of age, legislation is coming to Cabinet in the coming weeks and will provide a statutory basis for this. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and I have the same attitude to universal health insurance as to all legislation. We want to make sure costs are controlled but that is our general position across all legislation and policy brought before the Government. Under the new fiscal arrangements, we are operating under expenditure ceilings and it is our job to ensure the expenditure ceilings are not breached in any way. We scrutinise all measures on that basis but we are fully in support of the initiative. No one suggests that we can continue with the health service we have and everyone agrees it needs to be reformed.

In the context of that debate, can the Minister for Finance confirm whether there is a system in place in any other Department or State agency, particularly the Revenue Commissioners, that records phone calls from members of the public without their knowledge, whether the Minister for Finance is aware of that and whether it is in compliance with data protection laws? The second issue concerns the crisis in primary care in the GP sector. I have attended meetings with general practitioners who gave a summary of the 38% cuts, which started under the Fianna Fáil Administration. Legislation on the Order Paper, No. 115, emanated from Deputy Emmet Stagg. It amends the Competition Act and allows GPs to bargain collectively, along with other organisations funded by the State purse. Is it the intention of the Government to allow that legislation to progress, as was committed to in the first Croke Park Agreement?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	175	The debate on the terms of reference of the Justice Fennelly inquiry will take place next week. The terms of reference will be presented in the House by way of a motion because the terms of reference need the approval of the House. I have no information that anyone in the State agencies which report to me is involved in the kind of malpractice Deputy Doherty describes. If it is illegal, it is illegal and I have no information to that effect. With regard to GP care, legislation will come before Government and will be debated in the Houses in the normal way.

I appreciate the reorientation course. I have just been at a funeral and I came in late. The Government's intention to hold a banking inquiry seems to have got clogged in a swamp and does not seem to be getting anywhere. Yesterday, today and tomorrow, the banks' chief executives and senior management teams are appearing before the committee to explain where they are in terms of meeting the mortgage crisis, with 180,000 families in deep distress. On my way in and on his way out, I met the chief executive of Permanent TSB on the steps, he recognised me immediately and he said to me-----

The Order of Business is the Order of Business and it is not for people to stand up and make speeches on issues that they have deep concern about, which I fully understand.

The Planning and Development Act 2000 places full responsibility on the local authority for the taking in charge of all services but the Water Services Act 2013 transfers water services to Irish Water. I understand the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will bring forward some sort of protocol to address this anomaly which, in many instances, may give rise to the sale of houses being prevented from taking place.It will create a situation where the taking in charge of estates will be much more difficult. Will a protocol be introduced by the Department or will the matter be addressed in the context of the planning Bill which is promised at No. 86 on the legislative list?

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	234	The high incidence of receiverships has been a very serious issue, arising, as Deputy Brian Walsh outlined, from the collapse in the economy. If the Deputy has specific measures in mind, he should communicate with me and I will have his proposals assessed in the context of the forthcoming finance Bill.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	235	The Government has promised legislation to deal with the admission of patients with mental health issues. We have a huge crisis in hospitals where clients in need of admission are being turned away at accident and emergency services owing to the lack of beds. I have first-hand experience and knowledge of people who are a danger to themselves and others being turned away, purely because there are no beds available in hospitals across the city.

The number of households involved in the shared ownership scheme who are in mortgage arrears continues to be a problem. When will the housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill be brought before the House and will it make provision for a building programme to compensate for units sold under an agreed right-to-buy scheme and a solution for the growing number of shared ownership homeowners who have slipped into mortgage arrears?

Has the Bill been discussed? Have the heads been approved and when is the Bill likely to be brought before the House? Similarly, as I would like to keep to the fore, if possible, old friend of mine - the bail Bill - I ask again if it is intended to have it ready to bring it before the House at an early date.

In the light of the recent establishment of the independent panel to review and analyse the underground option for 400 kV lines as part of the GridLink project, will the Minister update us on the EirGrid Bill? Following the establishment of Irish Water and the transfer of staff from local authorities to it, will the Minister provide an update on the progression of both the planning Bill and the water services (No. 3) Bill?

It states specifically that as part of the review the Government will move a proportion of public spending to a personal budget model in order that people with disabilities and their families will have the flexibility to make choices that best suit their needs. I agree with the proposal which is a very good one, but we are now three years down the line. When might it become a reality?

I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that it was still a Government priority to honour the commitments set out in A Vision for Change. We were promised a review of the Mental Health Act. It was a human rights approach to providing for mental health patients.

It was also referred to the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Revenue and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Three years on has the Government made inquiries to ascertain whether it will be parked to gather dust or if there is active pursuit on the part of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Director of Public Prosecutions and Revenue of the findings of the tribunal? Reference has been made to the control of lobbying Bill. If such legislation had been in place a number of years ago, perhaps the Moriarty tribunal might not have been established at all. I am interested to hear when the House will receive some report on progress. That is owed to the House because the tribunal was established by it.

In the light of the fact that the Government confirmed that it would not oppose the latest Opposition Bill on the regulation of wind energy generation and given that it has promised guidelines to regulate the wind energy sector - the guidelines will not be published until after 23 May - will it be upfront and frank and indicate a definitive timeframe for when people will know its position on wind energy projects?When will we have legislation to deal with wind energy?

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	287	This is an extremely important issue. I am pleased to have this opportunity to raise it and I thank the Minister for Health for being present to respond to this issue. The need for more beds to be provided in Beaumont Hospital for cystic fibrosis patients is an urgent issue. I welcome the substantial advancement of services for cystic fibrosis patients in Dublin in recent years. Along with the opening of the outpatient facility at Beaumont Hospital, a dedicated cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's University Hospital opened in 2012, and newborn screening for the disease has been rolled out nationwide. That is very much to be welcomed. Beaumont Hospital is one of three major centres in Ireland for adults with cystic fibrosis but currently there is a shortage of inpatient facilities for patients with the disease. I am concerned that those who require a bed may not be able to access one and may have to wait at home until one becomes available. Alternatively, patients may have to access a bed on a ward if there is no dedicated bed available, increasing the chance of infection. There are concerns that the current situation results in the most severe cases of cystic fibrosis being prioritised while those with less severe symptoms are at risk of not getting the full treatment they require, which in turn has a negative impact on their condition. There are approximately 120 patients with cystic fibrosis attending Beaumont Hospital at present and this number is likely to increase. We know that Ireland has the highest rate of cystic fibrosis in the world, with approximately 50 new cases diagnosed each year. The incidence of the disease in Ireland is four times higher than in the US and the rest of the European Union. Beaumont Hospital opened a new purpose-built, dedicated outpatient facility at Beaumont for patients with cystic fibrosis in 2010, enabling patients to be treated on a day-care basis. The 2,500 square foot purpose-built unit provides invaluable services to cystic fibrosis patients, including outpatient clinics, a drop-in centre for clinical assessments and the provision of treatments that would otherwise require hospitalisation, including infusions and antibiotic therapies, psychology, physiotherapy and dietetics. Thankfully, the care provided at the new centre means that fewer cystic fibrosis patients are being admitted as inpatients via the emergency department, which is helping to minimise the risk of exposure to possible sources of infection.  However, there are currently only four isolation rooms available for cystic fibrosis patients at the hospital. Isolation rooms are vitally important for cystic fibrosis patients; they contribute to better health and prolong life expectancy as there is no risk of infection from other patients in the hospital or in the room. Constituents have raised concerns with me that the four isolation rooms currently available are permanently needed and filled with patients waiting for an immediate transplant and that more beds are desperately needed.  Cystic Fibrosis Ireland has been campaigning for quite a number of years regarding the need for more beds. Its campaign, Beds for Beaumont, seeks to raise €12.5 million to provide for at least 12 inpatient isolation rooms to accommodate more patients at the hospital. I am pleased to confirm that the area manager of the HSE in north Dublin advised me recently that the HSE recognises that there is a need for more inpatient single-room accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients at Beaumont Hospital and that it is going to put forward a business case. Can the Minister advise whether this is one of his priorities and, as he represents north Dublin, that this area will be urgently examined?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	288	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. It is one in which I have had a keen interest since I first stood in Dáil, and the issue of cystic fibrosis was the first matter I raised in an Adjournment debate in this House. The Government is acutely aware of the challenges that people with cystic fibrosis and their families face in managing their condition. It was a matter of grave concern to us all that ten years ago the average life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis on this side of the Border was ten years less than those on the other side of the Border. Some of the factors that influenced that were the lack of newborn screening, delayed diagnosis, overcrowding in emergency departments and the lack of single en-suite rooms. We are addressing those issues and although we have not completely addressed them, we have made a good deal of progress, as the Deputy outlined in his contribution. It is always the aim of health care professionals to avoid hospital admissions for cystic fibrosis sufferers wherever possible in order to minimise the risk of exposure to infection. Beaumont Hospital provides services to adults with cystic fibrosis in a dedicated outpatient facility which is primarily focused on providing ambulatory care to people with cystic fibrosis. The dedicated cystic fibrosis outpatient unit, to which the Deputy referred, facilitates a comprehensive range of multidisciplinary services; these include outpatient clinics, a drop-in centre for clinical assessments with medical consultants and nurses, and the provision of treatments that would otherwise require hospitalisation, such as infusions and antibiotic therapies, assessment of pulmonary function, physiotherapy, dietetics and psychology. The consultation and treatment rooms benefit from specialist air filtration systems for the purposes of infection control. Where admissions are unavoidable, there is a need for dedicated accommodation in an environment which allows appropriate isolation for improved infection control. It is Department of Health policy that there must be sufficient inpatient beds available nationally to treat all people with cystic fibrosis who require hospitalisation in single en-suite rooms. The Nutley Wing at St. Vincent's University Hospital, which was built at a cost of €29 million and opened in the summer of 2012, houses a dedicated cystic fibrosis unit and represents a major improvement in the care of cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland. The hospital currently treats 330 adults, which accounts for more than 50% of the cystic fibrosis adult population.Due to the proactive management of cystic fibrosis patients through its dedicated outpatient facility, Beaumont Hospital rarely experiences emergency admissions of cystic fibrosis patients. Access to single en-suite rooms is prioritised for patients with cystic fibrosis who require elective admission for prophylactic antibiotic therapy or other treatment on St. Paul's Ward, which is the specialist respiratory ward. In discussions with the national clinical care programme and the clinical team on site it was identified that due to the increase in numbers there is a requirement for more inpatient single rooms for Beaumont Hospital's cystic fibrosis patients. Beaumont Hospital is working through a number of options and anticipates putting forward a business case for the 2015 national service plan. This will be considered in the context of service development in the Dublin north-east hospital group. I welcome to the country Mr. Tony O'Connell, the new CEO of the group. A number of positive developments in cystic fibrosis services for the Dublin north-east hospital group are coming on stream at present, with the opening last week of a new outpatient unit in Drogheda, adjacent to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which will treat children and young adults from Meath, Louth and north County Dublin, and the imminent official opening of an outpatient cystic fibrosis suite at Cavan General Hospital. Thankfully, the prognosis for this rare but devastating disease has vastly improved over recent years due to significant investment in services and earlier diagnosis. I give the House my assurance that the Government is committed, along with the HSE, to continued investment in research projects and to training physicians to help people with this condition to live longer and healthier lives. We will work harder to limit the impact of this disease until such time as a cure can be found.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	I thank the Minister very much for his response and his commitment in this area. He has made progress, but more progress is needed, which will no doubt require more money in due course. I am here to make the case that extra isolation room beds are needed as soon as possible. At present, 120 patients with cystic fibrosis attend Beaumont Hospital and best practice is that isolation room beds for 10% of this number, which is 12, should be provided at Beaumont Hospital. This is an international rule of thumb. I accept the fact that the HSE is examining this and will include it in its 2015 national service plan, and that it recognises that four beds are not enough when it should be three times this number. There is an issue with regard to the fact that patients here have a shorter life expectancy than elsewhere. No doubt this can be examined further. Improvements and more isolation beds are needed. I ask the Minister to respond by saying he is committed to increasing the number of beds from four. It would be very much appreciated.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	To respond to the final matter raised by the Deputy, of course we are very much committed to a new strategic development on how Beaumont Hospital is organised and the paucity of single beds in the hospital as a whole. It was built in the 1980s but with a plan hailing from the 1950s and 1960s. It is in need of modernisation. No modern hospital would be built on the basis of big open wards. It would comprise mostly private rooms, as we intend in the new national paediatric hospital. I apologise - I meant single rooms, not private rooms, and these single rooms would be en-suite. More rooms are available in Beaumont Hospital but they are not dedicated solely to cystic fibrosis sufferers. I accept that it is extremely worrying for people who have cystic fibrosis and their families that if their condition is exacerbated they must sit in an emergency department. Last week I met representatives of the clinical programmes, Mr. Philip Watt from Cystic Fibrosis Ireland and Professor Gerry McElvaney and discussed examining an improved patient flow mechanism so patients do not have to go through the emergency department. I have not mentioned to date the decision of the Government to make available the new drug Kalydeco, which, for particular genotypes of cystic fibrosis sufferers, has proven to be a bit of a wonder drug. Last week I met a young lady who has been on the drug for over a year. In this period of time she has not been hospitalised on a single occasion. Normally in a given year she would have been hospitalised at least three times for an average of two weeks on each occasion. The improvement in her quality of life has been phenomenal. There is also an improvement from the taxpayer's point of view with regard to saved admissions. The drug is very expensive - there is no question about this - but it works for those for whom it is suitable, and genotyping means we know those who will benefit most from it. This will change what is now seen as best practice with regard to the number of single en-suite beds required for patients with cystic fibrosis, as will further developing community facilities, because, as I stated, the aim is to keep patients with susceptibility to infection, such as those with cystic fibrosis, out of hospital if at all possible and reduce their exposure to harmful pathogens which are, sadly, always in our hospitals to a greater or lesser extent.

As he is aware, the Meitheal programme in Wexford commenced in 1997 as a pilot scheme in New Ross CBS, when 12 students from the school were chosen to be Meitheal leaders. At the time it was funded by the local Lions club. Since then the Meitheal programme has expanded to cater for 21 schools throughout the county. It is a programme that enables students to take responsibility for the happiness of others and the safety and well-being of all who share the school environment. The programme is advertised among senior students, who are invited to become leaders. All applicants are interviewed and this is followed by a selection process. The training programme operates during the summer before the students return to school in September. The programme covers personal development, identity, self-esteem, communication skills, listening skills, assertiveness skills, group dynamics, group management and many other skills necessary for the students to develop if the programme is to be successful. After training the students return to their respective schools as sixth years and each is made responsible for a number of incoming first years. It is then the task of the Meitheal leaders to ensure the smooth transition of these first years into the school, and they must be able and available to assist them in any way necessary during the first few days and during the year. The Meitheal programme has been very successful and I have attended a number of awards ceremonies, which are held at the end of the year and are a highlight of the year. The students are very involved on a day-to-day basis. In recent months I have received numerous letters from former Meitheal leaders, first years who availed of the programme and teachers expressing serious concern about the withdrawal of funding, particularly from schools outside DEIS areas. They feel that as the programme has been so successful in County Wexford, funding should be made available not only in Wexford but throughout the country. I find it very difficult to accept that the Minister would withdraw this funding. It is not a huge amount of money but it is very important to ensure that the 21 schools in County Wexford continue to avail of the scheme. I have copies of many of the letters sent to the Minister and his office.One letter states:I am writing to you because I am concerned that the budget of Meitheal is being cut. I would really appreciate if you took the time to read my letter because I think you need to know how important it is to have a Meitheal leader when coming into secondary school. I am currently a student in the Presentation Secondary. I started first year in August last year. I found it hard to settle in but then I found that the Meitheal leaders were very helpful and very supportive and enabled me to settle down much better in the school.Both the Minister and I have been receiving letters like this. He should reconsider this decision. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, comes from Wexford and I am sure he would make available the additional few shillings to the Minister to enable the funding to continue in County Wexford for the Meitheal programme. The first allocation of moneys to this important programme from the Government was given by Mary Hanafin in December 2001. In fairness to all successive Ministers thereafter, they have continued to make available the funding. I have found it difficult to find a home for the Meitheal programme, because the office of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, referred me to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and that Minister then referred me to another office to deal with the programme. I reiterate that it is a very important programme that requires a continuation of its funding, and I ask the Minister to reconsider the position.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter. I can confirm my Department provided funding of €40,000 to the Meitheal programme in December 2011. The Meitheal programme has not received any funding from the Department since that date. The programme previously was allocated funding through the fund for the development of targeted educational responses to certain children at risk between 2000, the millennium year, and 2010. This source of funding was discontinued following a decision in budget 2009. The programme received funding as an interim measure in December 2010 and, as I stated, it also received funding in December 2011 as an exceptional measure to allow for the period up to the end of the 2011-12 school year. As has been noted, the Meitheal programme began in 1997 as a pilot scheme at CBS secondary school in New Ross. It is a training programme for students at senior level in secondary schools. In this programme, students are trained to become mentors for incoming students at junior level. It is a programme based on peer respect between students and one that enables students to take responsibility for the happiness of others and for the safety and well-being of all who share a school environment. The programme is advertised among senior students who are invited to become Meitheal leaders in their respective schools. All applicants are interviewed and a selection is then made. The students who are chosen to become Meitheal leaders undergo a training programme in the summer prior to their return to school the following September. This training programme covers a number of areas including personal development, identity, self-esteem, communication skills, listening skills, assertiveness skills, group dynamics and group management. After their training, the students return to their respective schools as sixth-year students and each is given responsibility for a number of incoming first-year students. The Meitheal programme works with 21 post-primary schools in County Wexford. Of these 21 post-primary schools, eight currently are participating in the DEIS programme. I must tell the Deputy and other Members that at a time of severely reduced resources, priorities must be decided, and the Department continues to target enhanced resources to the disadvantaged under its DEIS programme and to pupils with special needs. As the Meitheal programme mainly operates within non-DEIS schools, it simply is not possible to provide financial support, as funding is prioritised to other areas. The programme was evaluated by the evaluation support and research unit of the Department in conjunction with the inspectorate of the regional directorate in 2009. While the evaluation was positive towards the programme in its findings, the discontinuation of the fund for the development of targeted educational responses to certain children at risk, together with the requirement to achieve significant budgetary targets to bring public expenditure down to a sustainable level, mean that no funding strand is available for the Meitheal programme. Meitheal was advised in January 2012 that no further funding could be made to the programme due to the discontinuation of the children at risk fund.

It is held widely that when the aforementioned evaluation was conducted, those involved recommended strongly that this programme was very worthwhile and should continue. I again ask the Minister to reconsider the position because in every letter I have received from the principals of the 21 schools concerned, they all have referred to the fact of bullying in schools, about which all Members are concerned. The principals have stated that the Meitheal programme has led to a reduction in bullying-type behaviour and has added to the well-being of school first-year students during the transition from primary to secondary school. The principals state that the programme has advanced to the stage whereby students who have been at its receiving end now aspire to be Meitheal leaders. This programme costs little in the greater scheme of things but delivers so much in terms of the well-being of students. I ask the Minister, even at this late hour, to reconsider and have a rethink on this matter and to ascertain what can be done to provide at least some of the funding the programme received in the past. It would be a pity for the scheme to be abolished because of the small amount of moneys successive Ministers have been making available to it down through the years. The Minister should think again of the importance of this programme, as well as the tremendous work that has been done on the programme on a voluntary basis, both by the Meitheal leaders and by the teachers, who must not be forgotten. The teachers concerned have bought into the Meitheal programme and have given many hours outside their normal teaching hours to make sure it was a success throughout County Wexford. I therefore ask the Minister to reconsider the position.

I understand this was a pilot project that, as the Deputy has noted, has been very successful in County Wexford. However, were one to multiply that by the other counties to which, in terms of equity, it must be applied in order to implement it on a national scale, it would cost much more than €40,000. Quite frankly, the Government is still facing a difficult budget. While people's memories may be somewhat short, the legacy of Fianna Fáil's economic collapse is still very real. Deputy Browne can shake his head all he wishes.

I am facing an extremely challenging budget in the coming year and have had difficulties in previous years. It would be very easy for me to stand up à la Fianna Fáil, which did this for years, and simply state that the money will be found for the Deputy, that the Deputy will be all right on the day and so on.

There are schools that are running similar programmes, and one must learn how to do things. The culture of dependency on a grant for this and extra cash for that was characteristic of Fianna Fáil from 1997 until the collapse. The party would throw money at a problem to try to buy votes and get a result, but ultimately it lost all the votes it had and left a legacy of destruction around the country. I suggest that the lessons learned from the Meitheal programme could possibly be explored in a more modest way in the Wexford area, and I will tell the Deputy the reason I believe this would be worthwhile. The conventional thinking in the note prepared for me is to concentrate on DEIS schools. In fact, however, the majority of people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds are actually outside DEIS schools, and this is a unique attribute of the scheme to which the Deputy referred. There may be alternative proposals that can encompass some of the principles and ideas contained within the Meitheal programme, which is a good scheme, and which do not necessarily require money. I note the presence of buddy systems in other schools that do not cost money. There are ways in which the leadership and pastoral care potential of students can be enhanced that do not cost money. While one should not throw out the baby with the bathwater, the money simply is not there. As for the old-style Fianna Fáil attitude of finding money and throwing it at people in the hope that it will stick, or whatever, that option simply is not around any more, be it in education, health or elsewhere. We must find ways of working within our own resources, which remain limited.

Bhí mé i láthair ag cruinniú mór poiblí i Leitir Mór Dé Domhnaigh seo caite agus ag ceann eile le Joe Curran ar a raibh tinreamh maith i Ros Muc Dé Luain. Tá an imní faoin gceist seo cloiste ar Raidió na Gaeltachta agus ar TG4, mar thoradh ar chás a tuairiscíodh sna meáin inar cuireadh in aghaidh duine áitiúil faoin Acht Urthrá. Tá imní ar go leor daoine i gConamara, a bhfuil a slí bheatha bunaithe ar an gcleachtas traidisiúnta seo, faoina bhfuil i ndán dóibh anois. Tá sé soiléir, cé go bhfuil reachtaíocht ann chun bailiúchán ón urthrá a rialú, nach ndearnadh aon fhormhíniú riamh air agus nár cuireadh córas ceart rialaithe i bhfeidhm. Chomh maith leis sin, tá a fhios againn go bhfuil Arramara Teoranta, comhlacht Gaeltachta, tar éis ceadúnas urthrá a lorg chun feamainn a bhailiú. Anuas ar sin, tá Údarás na Gaeltachta, ar leis Arramara, tar éis socrú a dhéanamh an comhlacht a dhíol le hinfheisteoir as Ceanada. D'fhéadfadh sé tarlú gur i lámha príobháideacha a thitfeadh an ceadúnas. Tá go leor ceisteanna eile ann, mar shampla, an seasamh dlíthiúil maidir le cearta fóilió na n-úinéirí talún, an deis atá ann comharchumann a bhunú leis an gceadúnas a bhainistiú, an féidir go dtabharfaí an t-achar céanna do dhá cheadúnas, agus mar sin de. Mar gheall ar an imní atá léirithe ag na hoibrithe i gConamara, táim ag iarraidh ar an Aire Stáit agus ar an Roinn dul i dteagmháil leis na páirtithe leasmhara chun dul i ngleic leis na ceisteanna seo, ar mhaithe leo sin a bhí agus atá fós ag saothrú an chladaigh ar an mbealach traidisiúnta. As the Minister of State may be aware, there are significant concerns among coastal communities in Connemara about the traditional right to collect seaweed. I attended a large public meeting in Rosmuc last Monday evening, along with our candidate, Joe Curran, and also in Leitir Mór on Sunday evening. These concerns have been heard on Raidió na Gaeltachta and TG4. They concern an enforcement order against an individual under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2012 which was reported in the media. Many people in Connemara have made their livelihood out of collecting seaweed and selling it to various seaweed processing companies. Seaweed is used to produce many different products and it has become a sought-after commodity. While it is clear that legislation governs the collection of material from the foreshore, it has never been elaborated upon, put into practice or enacted in a proper way in these locations where small sole traders operate in the collection of seaweed. It is a family tradition that has been passed down through the generations in many cases. Arramara Teoranta is a company in the Gaeltacht which has sought a foreshore licence for the collection of seaweed in much of Connemara. As it is anticipated that this company will be sold to a Canadian investor, it is feared that the licence to collect seaweed on the foreshore will be taken from those who traditionally work there and will pass to a private foreign investor. Other issues include the legal standing of folio rights in the possession of landowners, the possibility of setting up a co-op to manage the licences, and whether two licences may be granted in the same area, one to traditional operators and one to a commercial entity. I am not asking for an immediate response from the Minister of State but I ask for the goodwill of the Department and of the Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, who has responsibility for Arramara Teoranta through Údarás na Gaeltachta. I ask that Ministers work with the stakeholders in order to find a solution that eases the concerns they have raised.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	306	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as an cheist thábhachtach seo a ardú. I understand that concerns have arisen recently with regard to seaweed harvesting and that these concerns may be associated with changes in the governance of Arramara Teoranta. While this is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am advised that it is expected that the sale of Údarás na Gaeltachta's shares in Arramara will benefit the State through a cash consideration to Údarás na Gaeltachta, through a significant investment in Arramara, and through the future development of the seaweed sector with a consequent increase in economic activity. My Department plays a role in regulating the harvesting of wild seaweed, and it is necessary that this valuable resource be managed appropriately to ensure it remains sustainable and that the marine environment is protected. The Foreshore Act 1933 prohibits the removal of "beach material" from any area of the foreshore. The definition of "beach material" in the Act includes seaweed, whether growing or rooted on the seashore or deposited or washed up by the action of tides, winds or waves. Seaweed that has been washed above the high water mark no longer belongs to the State. Under the Act, individuals or companies seeking to harvest wild seaweed from the foreshore require a foreshore licence from my Department. This requirement to hold a foreshore licence for seaweed harvesting has existed since the enactment of the Foreshore Act 1933. I understand, however, that folio rights may exist in certain cases and that deeds to privately owned land adjacent to the foreshore may, in some instances, grant limited harvesting rights. My Department is seeking advice on how such rights interact with the legislation. While private individuals may have been taking seaweed in small quantities for personal use, harvesting large quantities which might damage the seaweed crop in a particular area or have adverse effects on the marine environment is something that Ireland needs to avoid. Seaweed is a valuable resource and in recent years has become a growth industry, with seaweed now also being used as an ingredient in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, fertilisers, organic food and animal health supplements. A number of foreshore licence applications for seaweed harvesting have been received by my Department and are currently under assessment. These applications vary considerably and are made by both individual and commercial harvesters. I am acutely conscious of the need to strike a balance between protection of our national resources and the avoidance of an excessively bureaucratic or burdensome regulatory system. All foreshore licence applications are subject to a public consultation process, and any person may submit comments to my Department. I would encourage any person who may have concerns about any aspect of a foreshore licence application to make those concerns known to my Department during the public consultation phase of the application.

I acknowledge that the remit of her Department only covers part of the matter. The Department is seeking legal advice as to its obligations. I ask if the Minister of State would agree to meet Members from the Galway West constituency who have attended these meetings and if Deputy Dinny McGinley, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, could be invited to the meeting in order to be given a holistic view on this issue which would result in a productive working group to air these issues. The practice of collecting seaweed and the foreshore legislation have been in place for many years. As the situation evolves, the structures may need to change. Many families and individuals have engaged in this way of life for years. I ask the Minister of State to agree to a meeting with Members from Galway West, and I ask her to invite her colleague Deputy McGinley to attend the meeting. Such a meeting would air these issues so that the Government is seen to work with these communities and not against them.

The specific issue of the licensing of seaweed harvesting will be under review in the context of the Bill. In terms of what will happen in the future, that is a context in which we can work productively. The heads of the Bill have been approved, but its drafting is ongoing. Realistically, it will be the end of the year before it is brought forward, although I realise an issue will arise in the meantime. I would not have a problem with having a meeting and as such, we will see if we can facilitate one as soon as possible.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	310	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I thank the House for agreeing to discuss the Central Bank Bill 2014 today. I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who has a major commitment this afternoon. The legislation has two purposes, the first of which is to extend the current Central Bank legislation which allows for the transfer of assets and liabilities between holders of banking licences so as to permit the transfer of assets and liabilities from a building society to the holder of a banking licence. ICS is the only building society in Ireland. This will facilitate both the State and Bank of Ireland in fulfilling their respective commitments to the European Commission as part of the bank's amended restructuring plan. The second purpose is to make provision for certain payments from the Central Fund to the account established by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, as agent on behalf of the euro area member states, to receive payments for the purpose of providing financial assistance for the Hellenic Republic, namely, Greece. The Bill has three sections and a Long Title. Section 1 provides for the amendment of the Central Bank Act 1971. Section 2 provides for certain payments from the Central Fund to be transferred for the ultimate benefit of Greece, subject to certain conditions. Section 3 contains the Short Title of the Bill. In July 2013 Bank of Ireland agreed to an amendment to its restructuring plan which had previously been agreed with the European Commission in respect of state aid received by the bank. This allowed the bank to retain its life assurance subsidiary, New Ireland Assurance Company. As part of this amendment, the bank committed to certain substitution measures, including the sale of the ICS distribution platform, together with, at the option of a purchaser, up to €1 billion of mortgages and up to €1 billion of matching deposits. The purpose of the ICS substitution measure is to support new entities in entering the Irish market and thereby increase competition to ultimately benefit the consumer. For the avoidance of doubt, Bank of Ireland is not required, under the substitution measures agreed to, to sell ICS, rather to offer for sale the distribution platform, together with, at the option of the purchaser, certain assets and liabilities of ICS. The ICS distribution platform includes the ICS brand, the IT system and the broker network. As matters stand, Part III of the Central Bank Act 1971 can be used by banks to transfer between each other their assets and liabilities under a scheme of transfer under Part III of the Act. The effect of the amendments contained in the Bill is to extend the scope of Part III of the 1971 Act to enable building societies to transfer assets and liabilities under that legislation, as well as banks. ICS is the sole remaining building society in Ireland. Part III transfer schemes have been used successfully many times and after these amendments, ICS will be enabled to transfer its assets and liabilities in accordance with that framework. Any transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to the 1971 Act is subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Central Bank. If the Bill is enacted, it is anticipated that ICS will apply, pursuant to Part III of the 1971 Act, to transfer the bulk of its assets and liabilities to Bank of Ireland. It is anticipated that an onward transfer of some of these assets and liabilities to a third party would subsequently be effected. This onward transfer could include up to €1 billion of the €6 billion mortgage book held by ICS. The restructuring plan which has been agreed to between Bank of Ireland and the Euorpean Commission requires the Commission to approve the purchaser of the ICS platform. The primary purpose of this condition in the restructuring plan is to encourage competition in the mortgage intermediaries market. It is important to note that in respect of ICS, economic ownership of the building society has, by virtue of its membership rights in ICS, transferred to Bank of Ireland and that the members do not retain any right to any distribution of the assets of ICS. Bank of Ireland and ICS employ exactly the same procedures under the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and both organisations comply with the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA. Mortgage holders with ICS are not treated any differently from mortgage holders with Bank of Ireland. The ICS mortgage book value is approximately €6 billion, with approximately 40,000 account holders. The purpose of the proposed legislative change is to allow for a new entrant into the market, thereby increasing competition to the benefit of the consumer. This can best be achieved by a sale to a regulated entity and the broad thrust of the text included in the restructuring plan is consistent with this. The Commission, however, has the final say in regard to the ultimate purchaser and that decision is outside our control. There is also the broader issue of CCMA protection for residential mortgage borrowers who have had their loans sold by banks to an unregulated entity.The House should note that the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill, listed in the Government’s legislative programme, is intended to address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the code after the sale of loan books to unregulated entities. The Government is committed to bringing forward legislation to protect mortgage holders and will work with other interested parties to achieve the best solution for consumers. Officials in the Department of Finance are actively examining this with the Central Bank and the Attorney General's office with a view to bringing forward legislation to address the issue. It is intended this legislation will apply to all loans which were issued by a regulated financial service provider and subsequently transferred to an unregulated purchaser. Section 2 provides for certain payments from the Central Fund. Specifically, it is to provide a legislative basis for Ireland to make transfers to an intermediate account operated by the ESM, European Stability Mechanism, on behalf of the euro area member states. These transfers are to be in an amount equivalent to the income that accrues to the Central Bank of Ireland from the securities market programme, SMP, portfolio of Greek Government debt. The Bill provides that these transfers may take place up to 2026. However, as the amount in 2026 will be quite small, it is proposed that this will be paid in 2025. In November 2012, as part of the package of measures designed to help Greece, it was agreed by the euro area member states that the securities market programme related income of member states would be transferred to Greece under certain conditions. Euro member states agreed in January 2013 that the ESM would be the agent for making such payments. It has, accordingly, established an intermediate account into which the euro area member states can place an amount equivalent to the income on the SMP portfolios accruing to their national central banks as and from budget year 2013. Member states under a full financial assistance programme are not required to participate in the scheme while in a programme. As Ireland exited its EU-IMF programme of financial assistance in December 2013, the measure now applies to it. The next transfer date for this measure is 1 July 2014, the earliest date by which Ireland could be required to make its payment of €31 million for 2014 and the necessary legislation will need to be in place by that time. As is widely known, Greece is benefiting from its second programme of financial assistance, arising from the serious budgetary and economic problems it has experienced and its resulting inability to secure international funding at sustainable rates. On 27 November 2012, the most recent in a series of packages to assist Greece was agreed to by euro area Finance Ministers. It is designed to provide further assistance for Greece in putting its economy on a path to sustainable growth and its domestic finances on a sound footing. It was agreed in the context of the statement by euro area Heads of State and Government on 21 July 2011, reiterated in October 2011, that the Greek situation was different from that of other countries, therefore requiring an exceptional response. One of the measures agreed to in November 2012 was the SMP measure, the subject of section 2. As Ireland has successfully exited its programme, we are now liable to make payments under this process, beginning in 2014. Legislative provision needs to be made to permit these payments to be made. The full package of measures agreed to in November 2012 includes a debt buy-back of bonds held by private investors; a reduction of 100 basis points in the interest rate margin on the Greek loan facility, bringing it to 50 basis points; the cancellation of the guarantee commitment fee on EFSF, European Financial Stability Facility, loans; the extension of maximum maturities of the loan to Greece by 15 years to 30; deferral of the interest payments on Greece's EFSF loans for ten years; and that member states will pass on to Greece's segregated account an amount equivalent to the income on the SMP portfolio accruing to their national central banks as and from budget year 2013. Again, member states, under a full financial assistance programme, are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance. The Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2013 provided for the interest rate reduction and the maximum maturity extension. The debt buy-back, successfully completed in December 2012, and the cancellation of the guarantee commitment fee did not require either the amendment of existing legislation or the introduction of new legislation here. It is also important to note that, as before, these concessions to Greece are to accrue in a phased manner and conditional on a strong implementation of the agreed reform measures in the programme period, as well as in the post-programme surveillance period. The current SMP measure, with the deferral of interest rates previously agreed to, provides an additional level of financial conditionality both during the existing programme and also in the period of post-programme surveillance which will apply when Greece emerges from its programme. In Ireland, on the other hand, we have exited our programme. We are, therefore, subject to both the normal fiscal and economic policy co-ordination and oversight which applies to all EU and euro member states. We are also subject to post-programme surveillance but without the added potential financial sanctions which can apply to Greece as part of these measures. Both Greece and the other euro area member states agree that it is only through the full and strict implementation of the fiscal consolidation and structural reform measures included in their programme that Greece will regain competitiveness and be able to fund itself through the international markets. Some ask why Ireland is not seeking or being offered the Greek package or one similar to it. It is important to differentiate between Ireland and Greece in this case. Ireland's situation differs in fundamental aspects of fiscal and economic performance from that of Greece. The approach to these issues is, accordingly, fundamentally different. Greece's public debt prospects are of a different order of magnitude to Ireland's. Notwithstanding significant private sector involvement in March 2012 in its autumn forecast later that year, the European Commission forecast that the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio would worsen, reaching over 188% in 2013. This outlook, with a worse than expected economic and fiscal performance up to that point, was what prompted a reconsideration of Greece's debt sustainability in November 2012. Even after the series of measures agreed to and taking account of the impact of structural reforms in raising both growth and revenue in the coming years, Greek public sector debt could amount to around 124% of GDP by 2020. The corresponding Department of Finance assessment of Ireland's public debt, published in the budget last October, is that the debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at 124% in 2013 and will decline thereafter. The Greek economy has suffered a recession that was more severe than anticipated, with GDP declining by 23.5% from 2008 to 2013. Notwithstanding its difficult path, some welcome signs of recovery are emerging. On the fiscal side, Greece will record a primary surplus for 2013 which it expects to be larger than originally envisaged. Recent data support expectations that Greece should return to growth in 2014. Confidence indicators continue to improve, while hard data releases suggest the first signs of recovery. Structural reforms undertaken in labour and product markets have underpinned improved competitiveness leading to expectations for strengthened exports and investment. In addition, Greece's bond yields have also dropped sharply recently. There is, nevertheless, some distance to go towards recovery. A critical difference between the two economies in this regard relates to the importance of international trade. In Greece exports amount to the equivalent of about 25% of GDP, resulting in export growth not being in a position to provide much by way of offset to the contractional effect of fiscal austerity. In Ireland, by contrast, exports amount to the equivalent of over 100% of GDP, meaning that the growth in exports can provide a powerful offset to the impact of fiscal consolidation on economic activity.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	311	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Central Bank Bill 2014. While this debate is about the Central Bank Bill, I would like to point out that I have just come from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, which has been meeting with the various banks this week, primarily in regard to the issue of mortgage arrears. Yesterday, the committee met officials from Ulster Bank, this afternoon it met officials from Permanent TSB and AIB and tomorrow it will meet officials from Bank of Ireland. A clear picture is emerging from these meetings and I would like the Minister of State to take a message back to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in this regard. The Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Martin, raised this same issue with him on Leaders' Questions. Looking at the information that has been provided by the banks so far, in excess of 30,000 individual mortgage arrears cases are now undergoing legal proceedings or the mortgagees have received a letter from the bank advising them legal proceedings are about to commence. Therefore, we are witnessing a serious ramping up of enforcement activity by the banks in respect of mortgage arrears cases. I do not claim that all of these cases will result in the loss of the home in question. Hopefully, deals can be reached and solutions arrived at to protect the family home in the majority of cases, but inevitably many of the families involved will lose their homes. This seems certain now and is happening already. With over 30,000 cases in the system, this is an inevitable consequence. The Government's response, in terms of providing a safety net for families in this situation, is the mortgage to rent scheme. It is clear from the evidence being presented by the banks that this scheme is not working. In the case of the three banks that have come before the committee so far, only one mortgage to rent transaction has been completed. While there are a few hundred more in the pipelines, the banks are all saying the same thing, that these are exceptionally difficult transactions to conclude as they are complicated and bureaucratic. I urge the Minister of State to take the message to the Minister that he needs to provide a safety net or backstop for individual families who now face the prospect of losing their family homes. The mortgage to rent scheme is not working and needs to be reviewed so people can be given support. The Central Bank Bill 2014 is a short, essentially technical Bill. I support the provisions relating to Greece and I intend to bring forward some amendments on Committee Stage relating to the potential sale of ICS mortgages. It is noteworthy that as the two main provisions of the Bill are not by their nature linked, the Bill could be regarded as some sort of miscellaneous provisions Bill. This raises the question as to why other matters pertaining to the work of the Central Bank, for which there is a clear need to introduce legislation, are not being dealt with at this time. In regard to the Bank of Ireland-ICS Building Society issue, in July 2013 Bank of Ireland agreed an amendment to the restructuring plan it had in place with the European Commission. The essence of this was to allow it to retain its life assurance business, New Ireland, while requiring it to substitute alternative measures for this, including the sale of the ICS distribution platform, together with up to €1 billion of mortgages and up to €1 billion of matching deposits. As an aside, I might mention that the Commission was far more efficient in concluding an agreement for the restructuring of Bank of Ireland than it has been with Permanent TSB or AIB, whose restructuring plans remain not concluded. In a reply to me in respect of Permanent TSB this week, the Minister said the plan is still under negotiation, nearly two years after the plan was first submitted to the Commission. This is creating considerable uncertainty over the future of Permanent TSB, a subject I will return to at an appropriate time in the future. The underlying reason for the legislation is to facilitate the transfer of the ICS Building Society loan book to its parent company, Bank of Ireland, and the subsequent sale of its distribution network and possibly part of its mortgage book. I can see merit in allowing Bank of Ireland hold on to its New Ireland division. It is a stable business requiring relatively little capital and generating solid fee income on an annual basis. It makes Bank of Ireland an overall more attractive proposition to investors. However, I have serious concerns about the potential sale of ICS mortgages if the issue is handled in a manner similar to that of the former Irish Nationwide customers of IBRC in special liquidation. I would be grateful if in his reply to this debate, the Minister could provide us with some more detail on the current state of the ICS mortgage book. In regard to IBRC, it was a drawn out process to try to ascertain details of how many mortgages were in existence and the level of arrears. We have been given a figure in respect of ICS, the total value of the book and the number of customers. However, if we are to make a proper assessment of any sale of ICS mortgages, this information should be made available up front. The idea of generating more competition in the Irish banking sector is laudable. The decision by Danske Bank to join ACC in withdrawing from personal banking in the Irish market was another blow to hopes of real competition in the financial services sector. Fewer banks means higher borrowing rates, increased charges and reduced rates for deposits for both business and personal customers. The requirement to allow Bank of Ireland give KBC the opportunity to market its current account services to Bank of Ireland customers was a novel way of encouraging a more competitive market. We need more of these types of initiatives. When taking action to increase competition, it is crucial that the Central Bank balances its role as the regulator of banks that are struggling to become profitable again with its responsibility to protect the interests of bank customers. In essence we need a twin-track approach, effective regulation and competition. While the legislation may help competition somewhat by facilitating the sale of the ICS distribution network, I am concerned about the prospect of the sale of up to €1 billion of ICS mortgages. If the average balance on the mortgages sold is €150,000, this could involve over 6,000 mortgages being sold. When we debated the issue in committee, the possibility of these mortgages being sold to an unregulated third party was raised. This issue was addressed in the Minister of State's opening remarks. I am grateful for the briefing we received from Department officials, although I have concerns over their contention that as the purpose of this exercise is to generate greater competition in the market place, the European Commission would be unlikely to approve any sale to an unregulated entity. I am not so convinced on this point. It is quite conceivable that Bank of Ireland could look to de-risk its portfolio by selling off those ICS mortgages that are most in distress. This is something that should concern all of us. It would amount to an effective outsourcing of repossession actions. Can we be sure the Commission would block such a proposal if Bank of Ireland claimed to have a ready buyer for these assets? As we saw in the recent IBRC sale, there is most certainly a speculative market for distressed Irish property assets. Will the Minister confirm whether his approval will be needed for any proposed sale or will he simply defer to the wishes of the Commission? I am also concerned by the price that Bank of Ireland will get for the ICS assets being sold. The State is still a 14% shareholder in Bank of Ireland.While ultimately we will make a profit on our investment in Bank of Ireland, the sale of part of the State's equity stake in 2011 as well as the contingent convertible notes, CoCos, and preference shares was done at prices below their long-term value. I ask the Minister to use Committee Stage of this Bill to bring forward amendments to deal with sale of mortgages to unregulated third parties. The issue cannot wait until next year when the Government intends to publish its legislation. Although the Minister accepted a Bill I introduced on the subject in March and has promised to deal with the issue, the sale of IBRC has come and gone without action being taken. ICS Building Society customers are potentially in the firing line. How much longer can we afford to wait before action is taken? I also ask the Minister seriously to examine the recent ESRI report on competition in the banking sector and produce proposals as to how mortgage lending to couples and individuals can be improved. Yesterday in this House he said he would like to see house prices rise further. That is a one-dimensional view of the property market. We need a stabilisation of the market whereby a potential buyer with a good income and clear capacity to repay can get a mortgage at an affordable rate. We are a long way from that. Today's legislation may help if it generates more competition but there are risks attached to it and we need a wider range of actions to give us a functioning mortgage market. The second item in the legislation is a provision to allow the profits from the holdings of Greek Government bonds purchased through the ECB's securities markets programme, SMP, to be repatriated to that country. In its own right I welcome this. It was a concession to Greece as part of the various support programmes of bailouts and debt write downs the country went through. Today is a good day for Greece as it is re-entering the long-term debt markets. Its long-term bond yields are at or below 6%. Many thought we would not see this day for a very long time. However, it does not mean the European approach to Greece has been a success. It has been an unmitigated disaster. The Greek people have been put through a tortuous process of cuts and tax increases since the crisis began to unfold in 2008. The concession on profits on the securities markets programme is small in this context. The concession on profits on Greek bonds has implications for Ireland. It raises the issue of what will happen to profits made by the ECB on Irish Government bonds. While we are in the dark as to the extent of these profits, given the rally in Irish Government bonds and yields below 3% it is likely that they are considerable. Figures of between €3 billion and €5 billion have been mentioned. It would be an act of solidarity by our eurozone colleagues and a recognition of the huge debt burden Ireland still carries if a process were put in place for these profits to be paid back to Ireland. The Minister has been unusually silent on it to date and I urge him to pursue it vigorously. While I am on the subject of debt sustainability, I also urge the Minister to take action on the provision that if Ireland repays some of its IMF loans before maturity we must also pay off a proportionate amount of European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM loans. Our IMF loans are costing us 4.15% annually and have an average seven years to maturity. Our five-year bond yields have a yield of less than 2.5%. There is, therefore, an opportunity for Ireland to make a saving on our annual interest bill if we were allowed repay our IMF loans without a corresponding requirement to repay EFSF and EFSM loans. Given that the EU authorities were happy to extend these loans and reduce the rates, this is a concession we should actively pursue with them. Finally, the major unresolved question of retroactive recapitalisation of the banks will not go away. The Government has made various attempts to long finger the issue by saying it cannot be dealt with until the single supervisory mechanism is in place. By the time this happens nearly three years will have passed since the commitment to break the link between sovereign and bank debt. We need a clear commitment that this issue will be pursued vigorously and that the Government will not accept any going back on the deal that was entered into in respect of the promissory notes by accepting an accelerated timetable for the disposal of the Government bonds held by the Central Bank. As I mentioned at the outset, the two main provisions of the Bill cannot be regarded as related matters. During the pre-legislative stage we heard that while the ICS provisions are urgent given the deadline for the completion of actions under the Bank of Ireland restructuring plan, the item relating to Greece was essentially an add-on as it was convenient to deal with the matter in this Bill rather than introduce a separate one at a later stage. In this context I suggest two matters that we might consider could equally be dealt with under this Bill. The first relates to the Statute of Limitations for mis-selling of payment protection insurance and other claims before the Financial Services Ombudsman. The issue was back in the news recently and is one I have sought to deal with previously. As the law stands, the Ombudsman cannot deal with claims for mis-selling which date back over six years. This is patently unfair as many people may not become aware that they were the victim of mis-selling until after the six years has passed. A relatively simple amendment to give people three years from the date they become aware of the mis-selling would be an effective remedy to potentially thousands of customers. I will bring forward certain amendments on Committee Stage, which may be taken as early as next week. Overall we are supportive of the Bill and look forward to a constructive debate on it.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	312	The Central Bank Bill 2014 does two distinct things. The Bill may be rough around the edges. It would be tempting to say it is a purely technical Bill, but that is not the case. The two substantive articles in this Bill touch on very important issues. The first relates to the potential sale of up to €1 billion of mortgages from ICS Building Society, which is part of Bank of Ireland. It is a reflection of the times and the state the country is in that there is only one building society in the State. We fear the Bill could become the vehicle for the sale of a loan book to a vulture capital company, as we have seen with Bank of Scotland and IBRC. I accept the assertion of the Minister and his Department that this is unlikely to happen as this book, if sold, will most likely be sold to a new competitor in the market, which will be a regulated company. While we hope this is the case, it is not guaranteed. Legislation is the only way to ensure all mortgage holders are afforded the protection of the code of conduct and other protections. The legislation is with the Government and is also in a Private Members' Bill which has passed Second Stage. There is an opportunity to advance that Bill through the House. The Government should prioritise it and bring it before the Dáil as soon as possible, where it will get the support of both sides of the House. If it is to be a step to allow a new competitor into the market, that is welcome. The banking sector in Ireland is still very much a sick man. A new injection of competition is much needed. Perhaps the Minister or somebody from the Labour Party can update us on the Government's commitment to establish a State bank. Although the Labour Party made a commitment to do that, we have seen no moves in that direction. We eagerly await it. This manoeuvre relates to the restructuring plan at Bank of Ireland regarding the ICS business. This week the finance committee will hear that Bank of Ireland has reached its target under the mortgage arrears resolution scheme only through the use of legal action against those who are struggling to pay mortgages and householders who are in financial difficulty. Almost 3,500 households are under threat of legal action by Bank of Ireland, which is 14% owned by the State. In a couple of weeks the Minister will have the opportunity to make his position clear regarding the €843,000 remuneration package for its CEO. We urge the Minister to use the opportunity of his attendance at the AGM to deal with this. He should use his vote to oppose such an obscene pay packet. On this morning's Order of Business he said he would be reluctant to do so because it might send out the wrong signal. I am not sure to whom that would send the wrong signal. I do not know of many constituents who would consider it the wrong signal to find that the CEO of Bank of Ireland was going to have his remuneration package sliced a little. I know few citizens who would lie awake tonight worrying about that.The Minister told us this morning during Leaders' Questions he would let us know about the issue, and I hope that will happen before the Bank of Ireland annual general meeting and the message will be correct. He must use his vote effectively and send the correct signal to the citizens of this State, who have suffered much hardship. The second part of the Bill allows for the repayment to Greece of the interest on its loans, and we have no objection to that move. It was cruel in the first place, as despite all the talk of solidarity within the EU, the institution's loans led to a case where profits could be made by lenders on the back of the difficult position of the Greek people. The Greeks have struggled with austerity for many years, creating terrible social consequences for people and particularly those who are less well off in Greek society. Unfortunately, it has aided the creation of far-right organisations which have targeted some of the most vulnerable people in Greek society, including immigrants. That is a shocking development, so it is only right that the accrued interest is returned to the Greek people. When the heads of the Bill were before the finance committee, departmental officials were questioned as to whether Ireland had ever asked for a similar arrangement as that enjoyed by Greece. We were told the Government had not sought such an arrangement. In the Minister of State's opening address he differentiated between Greece and Ireland, which are two different countries experiencing different circumstances. Nevertheless, the Government did not seek to have interest payments on loans repaid to the Irish people, which is unsurprising. The Government's attempts to reduce the sovereign debt burden have amounted to tinkering at the edges and kicking the debt down the road. There are two chunks of debt hovering over the State and the Irish people, weighing on our potential to grow our way out of economic stagnation. We learned this week that the so-called deal on the first chunk, the IBRC debt encompassing the private debts of the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, could be unravelling. The European Central Bank, ECB, has indicated it wants the Irish Central Bank to dispose of the bonds exchanged for the promissory note at an accelerated rate, which is very worrying for a couple of reasons. It could mean the circular nature of the interest on the bonds would be broken and the interest would not be returned to the State via the Central Bank, which is a real concern. Additionally, the scheduled timing and planning of rates would be blown apart. When the Dáil sat through the night last summer to pass this sleight-of-hand, we opposed the measure not just for the sake of it but because of good reason; we did so because it wound down the bank but did not wind down the debt. Even worse than that, it turned the debt into a sovereign bond, and we have now heard the ECB is not happy with the arrangement and it is now under pressure. This should not be a sovereign debt and it should be lifted from the shoulders of the Irish people. A better deal should have been done on that promissory note. The second chunk of debt is the sovereign debt linked to bailing out the so-called pillar banks. We were told in June 2012 that the same European Stability Mechanism, ESM, being discussed today would ride to the rescue in this regard because of a seismic shift in policy. The term "game changer" was used. We argued at the time that the Government was overplaying the importance of the June 2012 statement, as there were contradictory signals from EU leaders. We have since seen the prospects of Irish banking debt being recouped by the State being rowed back. The ESM chief, the German Finance Minister and the European Parliament - led by the main grouping, which is associated with Fine Gael - pour cold water on this issue. The Government now has two battles on its hands and should not be afraid, even at this late stage, to stand up for the interests of Ireland. It must stand up to the ECB and the EU and play to the relative advantages we have. Sinn Féin is content to support this Bill on Second Stage in the hope the issues we have raised can be addressed. We appeal to the Minister and the Government to do so.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	314	This Bill deals with two important issues and I am very concerned about both. There are changes to the Central Bank Act with regard to building societies, particularly allowing building societies to transfer assets, infrastructure and so on to banks, which is precluded in the 1971 Act. It was reported to us on the finance committee that this is being done because the European Commission is requiring this of Bank of Ireland because of state aid rules. If I am correct, this would allow the ICS platform, which may be attached to a mortgage book, up for sale. That is very worrying, given what we have seen happen in the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, mortgage book. That book, containing debt from the former Anglo Irish Bank, is being put up for sale and vulture funds are seeking to get hold of and profit from it. As a result, there is great concern among mortgage holders about changes in circumstances and the fact that somebody else will hold the mortgage. These funds are not regulated so they do not necessarily have to comply with any codes of conduct or regulations that mortgage holders would want. We debated this at the finance committee and departmental officials suggested that the logic was conditional, as it was as possible that the book would be sold to regulated financial entities as it would not. Given what is happening now, it is highly likely that regulated entities will not buy the book, and we seem to be witnessing vulture funds from the US and elsewhere making the purchase. They were probably prompted and encouraged by the words of the Taoiseach when he was in New York on St. Patrick's Day, telling American investors that Dublin was the place to go in order to make a killing on the property market. Those were highly irresponsible comments from a Taoiseach in encouraging speculation in Irish property, mortgages and so on. These vulture funds and financial institutions seem to be moving in here at a rapid rate, and the Government seems very keen to facilitate them. This case involves state aid rules from the European Commission, which are obnoxious anyway. The Commission is very selective in its application of state aid rules, which are largely a pressure on states to privatise certain institutions, and in this case it involves the selling of assets to what are potentially unregulated bodies. I asked the very simple question at the committee of whether the ICS customers even know this is happening, and that their mortgages could be transferred to another financial institution or unregulated vulture fund. Has anybody bothered to contact them to indicate legislation is going through the Oireachtas facilitating this process? It is something with potentially profound implications.There will be no conditions put into the legislation to protect those people. The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform discussed this but, as I understand it, no changes have been made. That is typical of the very shoddy way the Government treats the innocent victims of a financial crisis created by the activities of bodies such as the European Union, the banks and property speculators who speculated on mortgages and so on. The same people are once again a party to moving things in their own interests, regardless of the potential consequences for innocent customers of ICS. That is pretty rotten. I strongly suspect many of these people do not even know this is happening and will not know till after the event, when it is too late. For that reason I oppose this Bill. It should not go any further. The distinction between building societies and banks no longer exists because there are no longer building societies in the proper sense. A distinction was drawn between the two in the Central Bank Act 1971 because there was an awareness that building societies operated on different principles from commercially oriented profit-driven banks and should therefore be treated differently. That has changed; building societies no longer have that ethos and are in effect banks. It is worth remarking on that fact because there was somehow an understanding that one might be better off with a building society or that some people might prefer to be with a credit union because of banks’ profit-driven agenda. People wanted to be treated differently, more humanely. That distinction between building societies and banks is gone, and while I do not know enough about ICS to say, it may have had a different style or relationship with its customers which could dramatically change after the handover to Bank of Ireland, but even more so after the handover to some other entity to which these things could be sold. This will suddenly be inflicted on the people concerned. It is rotten, and may produce another crisis for those people similar to the one that occurred with regard to the Irish Nationwide mortgage book. I will oppose the Bill for that reason. In respect of the Greek bailout, as I understand it, we will forgo the profits we might otherwise make on Greek bonds and give Greece cheaper loans to get it out of its difficulties. Why the hell did we not ask for the same facility? I would not want to deny that facility to the Greek people. When we ask why we did not ask for the same facility, the answer is that a lot of conditions were imposed on Greece, the implication being that those conditions were so harsh and so awful that we were better off not asking for it. I do not accept that, because conditions were imposed on us for the deal we did with the troika which were absolutely brutal and have savaged people in this country and done extreme damage to our economy and society. I do not understand why the Government did not ask, apart from the fact that its whole policy has been to be the best little boys in Europe and do exactly what the troika says in the hope of reward, but that reward is not forthcoming for the majority of citizens in this country. I am concerned about it because it is tied up with a so-called bailout which imposed brutal conditions of austerity on people. We should not sign up to it.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	315	I understand this legislation arises out of the restructuring plan agreed between Bank of Ireland and the European Commission. Under the plan, Bank of Ireland is required to offer certain assets of its ICS Building Society for sale. ICS must first transfer those assets to Bank of Ireland, which will then sell them. This Bill will permit the transfer to take place lawfully. We are told it is a technical Bill. In fact, however, there is a much bigger issue at play here that others have alluded to, namely, the philosophy of the European Union, the Commission and the European Central Bank. Jürgen Habermas put it well last year when he said: The actual course of the crisis management [The crisis may not be at its peak, but it is still there] is pushed and implemented in the first place by the large camp of pragmatic politicians who pursue an incrementalist agenda but lack a comprehensive perspective. They are oriented towards “More Europe” because they want to avoid the far more dramatic and presumably costly alternative of abandoning the euro.That would be really problematic, but there is validity in what he says. What bothers me about this is that the Commission is acting for the markets. In the recent reorganisation of the European Union there was a possibility that we would not have a voice. Where is our voice? What is it saying on behalf of the citizens of this country? We are seeing the impact of the liquidation of the IBRC on those who had mortgages from Irish Nationwide. They had no control over what happened to their mortgages. They were sold off in four different funds. Outside investors were most interested in those that were in trouble. They did not want the performing mortgages because it would cost them money to administer those mortgages. They wanted the ones they could get at a huge discount and that they could sell off. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said this morning that nobody is speaking for the taxpayer and that he is trying to make sure the taxpayer is protected. I do not see how the taxpayer is protected when people’s homes are repossessed and the taxpayer must, rightly, step in to make sure people have shelter, whether through rent assistance, local authority houses or other types of support. The taxpayer must pay a price that could, in some cases, have been avoided by doing some things differently, but we were told yesterday that was not even written into the terms of reference. What worries me is that we are repeating the mistakes made in the winding down of the IBRC and its impact on those mortgage holders. We have no guarantee that €1 billion worth of Irish mortgages will not be sold to an unregulated institution. It is important that the Minister of State tell us how many mortgages are involved when he wraps up this debate. Deputy Boyd Barrett made a good point about the ICS mortgage holders knowing about it, because the Irish Nationwide mortgage holders did not know anything until they got the letter in August or September of last year.Then they realised the impact it would have on them and how their mortgages were packaged and sold. The Commission has indicated that it would prefer not to endorse a sale to an unregulated institution, but there is no legal protection in this regard. Given that the Commission is to the forefront in generating the legislation and directives with which we comply, why does it not do something about the matter? Surely it has a role to play when it considers any potential sale, as provided for in the Bill, in terms of prohibiting assets from being sold to unregulated institutions. Can we safely assume Bank of Ireland will take the opportunity to offload some of the more troublesome mortgages in the ICS loan book? In doing this, it is extremely likely that the purchaser will not be found in Ireland. When I raised this issue in the context of the Irish Nationwide Building Society loan book, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, advised me that I should not prejudge who was going to buy the mortgages because it was possible that the purchaser would be an Irish institution. That did not turn out to be the case. It would be wrong to argue that others should not profit from our debts if we do not acknowledge that it is equally wrong for others to profit from Greece's debts. I support that side of the legislation, but I have serious concerns about the domestic side. I wonder whether these two matters have been grouped together in the Bill as a means of getting people to agree to it. I do not understand how the Commission can agree matters with Bank of Ireland without setting out conditions. The issue of the excessive salaries paid to people at the top of that bank was raised this morning. It appears that it is all one way traffic when it comes to protections. The banks and those at the upper echelons are protected, but citizens are much further down the pecking order. When one considers the bailout of Bank of Ireland and the significant debt discounts it received when its loans transferred to NAMA, our interest goes way beyond the Minister's 14% shareholding. As we approach the European elections, we must ask ourselves what kind of Europe we want. The European Commission is heavily involved in this arrangement. It will not be possible to create a Europe with a social conscience or that works for its citizens if the Commission acts first and foremost on behalf of the money markets. It is understandable people become eurosceptics when they see how measures can be arranged to the detriment of individuals who are not even considered in the terms of reference, as was the case in respect of Irish Nationwide Building Society mortgage holders. There is an absence of a big vision to solve this crisis, in the way that there was a vision in the aftermath of the Second World War. The London debt agreement of 1953 was one of the greatest acts of solidarity among nations, including Britain and France. We put a few bob into the debt fund, as did Greece. The biggest beneficiary of the debt agreement was Germany, the debts of which were either written off or rescheduled over such a long period that the last repayments were only made in recent years. That type of vision should be articulated by the European institutions. It is not enough that we concentrate on the technical working out of issues. We need a vision for the Europe we desire and the European Commission must be at the centre of it. These limited technical agreements are only prolonging the process and adding to the agony for some individuals.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	316	I am totally opposed to the Central Bank Bill 2014 which proposes to compel the sale of €1 billion in mortgages and €1 billion in matching mortgages of ICS Building Society. The Minister of State said the Bill would support new entities in entering the Irish market and increase competition to ultimately benefit the consumer. That is palpably a false premise on which to base the substantial banking measure proposed in the Bill. The boot prints of the European Commission and the European Central Bank are all over this proposal. They are dictating it to the Government which has fallen to its knees in front of these European agencies, as usual. The Commission and the ECB are the very agencies which insisted that the private bad gambling debts of the speculators, the developers, the bankers and the bond holders in the Irish property bubble be paid for by bleeding the people dry in the six year austerity programme through which we have come. Why should we believe or accept anything these agencies say, given their record of compelling the people to take on their shoulders the debts of the sharks in the European financial markets who recklessly gambled in the Irish property bubble as they chased super profits? The people had nothing to do with these actions. The Commission and the ECB protect, first and foremost, the interests of the sharks in the financial markets, the major financial institutions and the bond holders, not the interests of the Irish people, the Greek people or working class people anywhere in Europe. What did so-called competition between banks and mortgage providers do for the people between 2000 and 2008? They piled in here to blow even bigger the property bubble that was developing and outdid each other, not in the interests of consumers or ordinary people but in gouging as much as they could from unfortunate young working people in the main who needed to put a roof over their heads and were made by these gougers, with the developers and other speculators, to pay exorbitant amounts of money for the basic human right to a home and condemned to unsustainable mortgages. Unlike their parents who had repaid their mortgages over 20 years, they took out mortgages of 40 years' duration. That is the record of the entities the Government now seeks to bring here in the interests of the consumer. Who is it fooling? These entities blew the bubble sky high until it shattered, with disastrous consequences for the people. The sharks then got the European Union and the ECB to force two Governments - Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in the first and Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the second - to fall flat on their faces in front of the laws of the financial markets to defend the sharks' interests and bail them out from the crashed casino of the Irish property market.Therefore, I am totally opposed to this proposal and to the sale of one sixth of the mortgage book of ICS. These unfortunate mortgage holders, perhaps 6,000, 7,000 or 8,000, could end up in the hands of vulture capitalists from anywhere in the world, exactly as has happened to the unfortunate mortgage holders with Irish Nationwide, who found themselves parcelled and sold off a few weeks ago by the IBRC to American vulture capitalists. The latter are now in the hands of international speculators. They stood outside the Dáil to beg the Government to give them an opportunity to buy back their mortgages at the discounted rate that was being offered to the speculators, but the Government refused, because that was also in the interests of the sharks in the financial markets. The capitalist financial system is a diseased system from start to finish, run in the interests of super profits and of tiny elites in the financial markets who are unelected, unaccountable and invisible to ordinary people. Now we are told that a further inoculation of the bacteria causing that disease will somehow cure it. What incredible logic. I stand instead for complete public ownership of the financial system in this country and in Europe under the democratic control and management of ordinary people so that these institutions are utilised entirely for the benefit of society to build the homes that our people so desperately need at present, to give investment to small enterprises and the self-employed, to create the jobs and reboot the economy destroyed by austerity, and, in general, to work for the benefit of society. That is what would be in the interests of our people. The second part of this Bill deals with provisions pertaining to the European Stability Mechanism with regard to loans to Greece. No Irish socialist could support anything that supports the architecture of the bank bailout and, in particular, the bailout that was forced on the Greek people and has enslaved them for the past five years. The Minister of State had the audacity to state, "Greece and the other euro area member states agree that it is only through the full and strict implementation of the fiscal consolidation" - that is, austerity - that Greece will be able to recover. The Minister of State went on to make further statements with regard to how matters are going well in Greece. I will bring an air of reality to the Dáil. The EU and the ECB, with the complicity of the Irish Government, have condemned the Greek people to a never-ending Gethsemane of suffering through the economic policies that have been forced on them. The Greek people have been forced for five years to sweat their lifeblood in order to satisfy the sharks in the financial markets and, like the Irish people, forced to salvage the big players in those markets. The catastrophic austerity agenda of savage cuts in Greek public services, wages and incomes has ground the Greek economy into the dust. There is a humanitarian crisis of horrific proportions. Workers have lost 50% of their purchasing power since 2009. Unemployment is at 28%. Youth unemployment is at 61%. A full 50% of hospital beds have been closed down under the austerity programme. Children are coming to school malnourished. That is the reality of EU policy in Greece. This horror has created conditions in which even the fascist right are garnering a foothold. As in Ireland, these are not solutions. As in Ireland, the only solution is a socialist transformation of the economy of Greece in the interests of the Greek people. I urge the Greek working people, who, joined with the Irish, the Italians, the Portuguese and the Spanish, all are victims of this system, to overthrow this rotten system and put in its place a system that is run in the interests of society and of humanity. That is the alternative to the Government's Bill.

#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	One of the features of the financial instability and turmoil that the country faced some five years ago was that of institutions acting outside their areas of traditional competency. Building societies exemplify this. Institutions that previously had been concerned solely with providing financial assistance to people to purchase homes expanded into commercial and property sectors. The results, as the House will be aware, were primarily disastrous. The shortcomings of the legislative framework became apparent and conspired with the failings in regulation and oversight to create a situation which has characterised government across many countries ever since. In this context, the introduction of this legislation is welcome. The Central Bank Bill will extend the application of Part of 3 of the Central Bank Act 1971 to building societies. Incidentally, the legislation is also necessary to permit the continued restructuring of the pillar banks, including Bank of Ireland, which is seeking to complete the sale of specific assets and liabilities of ICS Building Society. The sale could not take place without the passing of this Bill. It is vital and necessary for us to have a comprehensive and effective legislative framework in place which oversees and regulates our financial sector. We must learn from the grave and foolish mistakes of the first decade of this century, mistakes that have had such catastrophic consequences. Aside from this, we must also ensure a degree of flexibility so that we can return to normal healthy levels of financial activity. This includes borrowing and lending as well as saving. On Monday last, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and I met representatives of St. Columba's Credit Union in Galway and the Ballybane Enterprise Centre in the city. Many Members from the west will be aware of those organisations on account of the successful SCCUL Enterprise Awards, which celebrate, reward and promote entrepreneurship and enterprise in Galway and the west. The main concerns raised at the meeting on Monday, as the Minister of State will be aware - they promised to send both of us a submission - centred on the restrictions currently in place on credit union lending. Notwithstanding some problems that arose with a number of them, credit unions are a hugely positive feature of Irish society and they play a considerable role in promoting financial inclusion and providing financial services to a wide number of people who might otherwise be excluded. The voluntary and community themes run to the core of the credit union movement. SCCUL is a registered charity but it is separate from St. Columba's Credit Union in Galway. Established in 2002, its vision is to make a contribution to help prevent and alleviate poverty in the Galway city area, to develop leadership skills, to prevent socioeconomic isolation and to support the least privileged groups, and, as the Minister of State will be aware, it does wonderful work. It runs an exceptional credit union to a very high standard and with high reserves. It is as a result of prudent and careful management that it has these sizeable reserves. These reserves could be used to assist small to medium-sized local businesses that require finance for expansion. Such lending, in turn, would have a considerable positive impact on job creation. With this legislation before the House, it is clear that the Government is open to introducing legislative changes and reforms which help businesses expand and create jobs while maintaining a high level of oversight and responsibility which are so essential in a sustainable economic system. I encourage the Ministers to examine legislation and amendments that would help credit unions to help local businesses to the benefit of communities across the country. As I stated, we are awaiting a submission from the group, but it has considerable reserves that it wishes to be able to promote in its area, either in terms of lending to businesses or for some of the capital infrastructure that is needed in its community in the Galway city area.The latter part of the Bill concerns implementing a mechanism to facilitate the assistance which our country promised to provide to another of our European colleagues in difficulty. In Ireland, we have a proud history of helping those in need or those less fortunate even when we were not exactly in the best position. Through the determination and work of the Irish people, and the assistance from the EU and the IMF, we have exited the bailout programme and regained our economic sovereignty. It has not been easy and it has required sacrifices and difficult decisions but we have regained our economic sovereignty. Portugal will soon do likewise. Other European nations, however, most notably Greece, are still grappling with serious economic challenges. Just as Ireland assists less developed countries whose peoples continue to struggle with poverty, we have a duty to assist Greece, to which part of this Bill refers.

The first part of the legislation brings about the possibility and encouragement of more possibility and more competition within the Irish banking system and that is to be welcomed. The second part concerns the European Stability Mechanism, ESM. There was commentary earlier about the European Central Bank, ECB, report issued this week and the concern that the promissory note deal of one year ago was to be renegotiated, as another Member suggested. We must be clear what was said in the ECB report. Last year, the ECB noted Ireland's promissory note deal and expressed some concern. Why is the ECB expressing concern? It is linked to the great fear the ECB has about monetary financing, which is quantitative easing. It seemed to suggest any slippage towards monetary financing will dilute the powers of the ECB. It says that the fact that we are making payments over the next 25 to 40 years mitigates their concerns. One of the flaws is that it does not accept a timeframe and, by accepting there is a timeframe for the issuance of bonds, it is tacitly accepting that we are not breaking any rules. It is a complete misnomer to suggest the best deal done by this Government, the promissory note, is unravelling. That is nonsense. The Ceann Comhairle would have been inundated with requests to discuss why we are paying up €3.1 million in March if we had to do so last year and this year. It would be the topic of the day had it not been for the renegotiation of the promissory note deal, which was an enormous success. Members of the Opposition, having not been able to have a debate about the €3.1 billion, are running around trying to find other fears to prey on. One valid query is the difference between the ECB and the Federal Reserve in the United States. The reason the ECB is terrified of monetary financing or quantitative easing is because it is terrified of inflation. The only direct rule the ECB must concern itself with is inflation. In contrast, the Federal Reserve in the United States also has a mandate to look at inflation but must also consider unemployment levels. If unemployment levels go above 6% or 7% – I am not sure which – the Federal Reserve can step in and print more money to create vibrancy and growth in the economy. The ECB does not have that function. Looking at the stagnant levels of growth across the Continent over the past number of years, it is time the leaders of finance in Europe look at this difference between the two central banks. There are deep and technical arguments and some suggest there is a culture of fear of inflation, given our history. In light of the fact that, through the promissory note deal, we reduced the amount of money we would take out of the Exchequer and, consequently, we are one of the few countries experiencing growth, over the coming years the ECB should copy what is happening in Ireland rather than noting concern about it in a report. Ireland, in contrast to Europe, has had the growth all of us on the Continent need.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	I will take up where Deputy Dara Murphy finished. I was shocked at some of the media commentary over the past 24 hours, particularly that concerning the finance spokesperson of the main Opposition party. He tried to cast all sorts of doubt on the negotiated agreement of Deputy Noonan, which saw the end of the promissory note. This was a positive step for the country financially. Last year, we ensured that we would not pay in excess of €3 billion at the end of March every year for the coming ten years. That arrangement had been negotiated by the previous Government, in which that finance spokesman was a Deputy. He was in this House on the Government benches but he now tries to cast aspersions on the validity of the agreement, which has lifted a huge weight off the shoulders of the Irish taxpayer. People have short memories but they need to be reminded of what they landed the country in a couple of years ago. I have no difficulty in supporting the legislation. I should hold my hands up and say that I have €300 in an ICS Building Society account. It will not be affected in any way by the legislation. I used it as a savings account to gather funds to make a down payment when I bought my house. When I was in secondary school, which is not all that long ago, there were several building societies operating in the Irish financial sector. Now, we are down to one building society, which is a subsidiary or an arm of one of the pillar banks. The legislation seeks to allow an agreement between that pillar bank and the European Commission, which was made in the middle of last year, to come into practice. The second aspect of the Bill concerns the establishment of a transfer facility with the ESM to deal with the difficulties in Greece. I agree with some of the points made by Deputy Joe Higgins to the effect that Greece is in a very difficult position. Legislation that allows for its difficulties to be eased somewhat should be welcomed. I must get across the importance, for the future of the country, of avoiding what we witnessed in the five or six years before the economic crash. In essence, this involves avoiding another property bubble. In certain parts of this city and in isolated other parts of the country and particular segments of the market, we can see significant shortages and dramatically rising property prices. Economically and politically, I can see the benefits and the necessity for property prices to increase somewhat to help people in significant negative equity.The overriding responsibility of the Oireachtas must be to ensure that we never again experience a property bubble such as we had prior to the economic collapse a few years ago. We should look around at different parts of Europe. Germany, in particular, is an obvious example of a country that has studiously avoided boom and bust cycles in the property market over the course of its economic history since the Second World War. Germany has achieved that by means of a number of measures. The previous speaker, Deputy Dara Murphy, correctly hinted at the reluctance of the European Central Bank to get involved in quantitative easing and the dangers associated with it from an historical perspective in Europe such as inflation and hyper-inflation, in particular from a German point of view, as it led to a political situation in that country that had serious and devastating repercussions across the Continent and further afield. At this juncture perhaps the European Central Bank might look at the way the Federal Reserve in the United States operates in order that some of the best parts of its approach could be introduced into the operations of the European Central Bank. There is more than just Germany in the eurozone but that point does not often come across as well as it should. In certain parts of this city there is a shortage of larger homes and apartments which is leading to an increase in prices. We only have to look at the property supplements of newspapers. For some years such supplements virtually disappeared or were only printed every now and again but they are now back and are nearly as big as they ever were. The latest research shows that property prices, in particular for larger homes in the south Dublin area, are starting to increase significantly. There is a need for stimulating activity in the construction sector in that segment of the market and in the apartment rental sector. I could bring Members to a few apartment complexes in Carlow and Kilkenny in my constituency where nobody would ever live in an apartment but we do not have apartments in places where we need them. For those reasons there is a strong argument to be made for stimulating the property sector to ensure a supply of apartments in parts of Dublin city in particular. Economic activity in Dublin has increased at a pace which is far quicker than most of the rest of the country in recent years. I do not wish to cause difficulty by making that point. Everybody outside of Dublin is pleased that certain parts of Dublin are improving but people would like to see more improvement in their own part of the world. The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O’Sullivan, who has responsibility for social housing is more familiar than I am with the significant shortages in the supply of social housing in Dublin but also right across the country, including in my area. We should never lose sight of the fact that a political decision was made in the early part of the millennium to remove the regulatory role of the Central Bank for financial institutions and to establish the Financial Regulator. It is an understatement to say that did not work. I was not a Member at the time but the committee responsible was chaired by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. McDowell, which came up initially with the homework for the legislation which resulted in the establishment of the Financial Regulator and the removal of the function from the Central Bank. In future, we must be cognisant in all of our utterances, actions and legislation so as to ensure the property bubble which has crippled so many people in this country and that will leave a lasting legacy for individuals, families and the State cannot be repeated. I am not convinced enough is being done to avoid the emergence of a property bubble again. In certain parts of the city in particular we are already seeing surging prices which are not a positive indicator in terms of avoiding that horrific scenario in future.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	325	Thank you, Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to speak on this new piece of legislation, the Central Bank Bill 2014. Before I go into the details of the legislation I wish to say that there is no point discussing the Bill unless we face up to and deal with other core issues as well such as unemployment, low pay, financial services, housing, banking and the SME sector. There is a strong link between the Bill and the broader issues. We must focus on those urgent matters and come up with sensible and workable solutions as people are suffering following difficult years. We must be radical and creative in dealing with the financial and banking crisis. People have taken enough. They need a break and they need it now. The Bill has two main purposes, the first of which is to extend Part 3 of the Central Bank Act 1971 so that it will apply to building societies as well as to banks. Specifically, the Bill will make provision for the effective transfer of the business and other assets and liabilities of building societies and for those and other purposes to amend the Central Bank Act 1971. The second purpose of the Bill is to make provision for certain payments out of the Central Fund to the account established by the ESM as agent on behalf of the euro area member states to receive payments for the purpose of providing financial assistance to the Hellenic Republic and for related matters. They are the two main reasons for the legislation and are at the heart of it. We must consider ideas and work relating to the banking sector. I urge the Minister to have an open mind on public banking, as it could be very important. I commend Mr. Gerry Duddy and the Public Banking Forum of Ireland on putting forward ideas that would help the economy. I would welcome the introduction of public savings banks in this country – public banks that are mandated to support SMEs. Such banks would lend only their customer savings and their aim would be sustainable lending rather than maximising profits. They would return all interests and profits to the public banking community and they would be banned from financial speculation. A total of 64% of banks in Germany are public banks. They increased their lending to the SME sector by 17% between 2008 and 2011. Public banks are important and they were a strong factor in Germany’s survival of the recession. They are also a success story. Greece is getting EU assistance to set up 40 public banks, two of which are to be set up immediately to support SMEs, while Ireland is borrowing from a German public bank for our SMEs. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has already invited private European banks to compete in the Irish market – more banks that will not lend to our SMEs. Small and medium enterprise provides two thirds of all jobs in this country. We should never forget the massive contribution of the SME sector to the creation of jobs in this country. The logic of such actions beggars belief. We must ask such questions so as to make a contribution to the broader debate on the Central Bank but also on the financial problems facing this country. I wish to ask the Minister for Finance a number of questions. The first is why we are borrowing for SMEs from the German public bank, KfW, when we should set up our own bank as Greece is doing with EU assistance.We are basically funding SMEs by using €6.4 billion of our National Pensions Reserve Fund with €2 billion from KfW but the profits will go to the foreign bank. What logic is there in inviting into the Irish market more private banks that will not lend to our SMEs when we consider that Germany's success is mainly due to its public saving banks supporting its SMEs? That is a fundamental question for the Minister. I would like to see a proposal from the Dáil - from an all-party committee - to investigate the potential benefits to the Irish economy of a comprehensive public banking system in Ireland similar to what they have in Germany. The Opposition is criticised regularly for not coming up with ideas but that is an idea. I am not saying I have all the solutions but that is an idea that should be seriously examined. 
 The public savings banks operate on commercial principles with the aim of maximising sustainable lending, not of maximising profits. They operate on the principle of local deposits and local loans, keeping capital in their own area. They only lend money they have, that is, there is no fractional reserve lending. Surpluses remain with the bank and within the region. Profits are used to increase equity and for non-profit purposes - the public benefit principle. They are banned from engaging in financial speculation and only allowed to lend to local people and businesses in their county or city area. They are controlled by stakeholders from the local community and are independent of political influence and control. These are all the positives of the public savings banks. The joint liability scheme provides protection for all savings bank branches. They are mandated to finance all businesses and SMEs within their designated area. They can retain cash in Irish society - the aim is to have a cashless society by 2017 under the current system - and the public savings banks can provide cheap or free credit card services for businesses that bank with them. Those are some ideas relating to the broader issues that the Minister or the Committee on Finance and the Public Service should not be afraid to examine. We also have to face up to the reality of the tax issue. I note it has come up lately in regard to our public service and also in regard to the urgent need for a universal health service, which I strongly support. I know some of my Opposition colleagues are jumping up and down about the costs, but if we want to have a public health service, we will have to pay for it. That is the reality. Most sensible people will accept that point and will make their contribution. Of course, they want information about the figures and the background to it but they will pay for it. They are prepared to pay a little extra in tax for a quality health service where there is equity in the system. That is the problem with the current system. We need to face up to the reality that if we want a proper health service, we will have to make some sort of a contribution towards it. It is not good enough to jump up and down and say that we want a public health service but we are not prepared to pay extra taxes. We have to examine that and take the hit if we are to be genuine and honest with people. At the time of the last election when we canvassing at the doors, most people said to us to get in there and try and do something, try to fix the economy, get on with the job and stop messing them around. That was a regular comment we heard on the doorsteps. We seem to be running away from the tax issue. Why are we running away from adopting the financial transaction tax? The EU will discuss it on 6 May. The details of a financial transaction tax indicate it would apply to trading in bonds, shares and would raise a net of between €300 million and €500 million for public finances in Ireland. It would reduce the harmful economic activity by acting as a curb on speculation and risk taking by increasing the cost of transactions and can increase growth and reduce poverty by making resources available to invest in public services, addressing climate change and supporting development in the State. It would raise between €300 million to €500 million but we are all worried that London or some other country will get the gig. I propose that it should apply across the European Union and in that way no member state could hijack the gig. Around the world people are campaigning for this financial transaction tax, believing that the banks, the hedge funds and the rest of the financial sector should pay their fair share in respect of the global financial crisis. That is the just side of it. Those guys caused the problem and they should make a contribution. We are not trying to close down the financial services in this country. That is an argument I hear regularly in debates on this issue in this House. We are trying to bring equity into the tax system. We could raise between €300 million and €500 million from the application of this tax and I believe they are conservative figures and that there is the potential to raise more from it, but it must be done across the European Union. In the European Union 11 countries are currently preparing to introduce a financial transaction Act under a special enhanced co-operation procedure. This is a legislative measure and can be adopted by a minimum of nine countries if a policy does not enjoy sufficient support for adoption across the European Union. Our Government, in this opportunity presented, did not opt to introduce a financial transaction tax, while countries like Germany, France, Greece, Spain are planning to announce their agreement on the tax on 6 May at the meeting of the finance Ministers. We have run away from adopting that tax, but we must do so if we are serious about addressing our problems because there is a lack of money in the country to provide the urgently needed services. I was in Darndale on Monday morning and saw an excellent service being provided in my constituency. It employs 100 people and provides a service to 260 preschool children, many of whom come from disadvantaged families. That service is short €100,000. When we consider that such a tax could raise between €300 million and €500 million, we need to wise up, cop on and start supporting services, and these are services that will prevent young children at risk, and child who come from dysfunctional families, ending up in Mountjoy in 15 or 20 years' time. Sometimes the financial people only look at the statistics, they do not take account of the broader picture. That is something they have run away from and they need to accept their responsibility.  I heard some colleagues speak about the housing crisis and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is present and participating in this debate. We all know there is a huge housing crisis here and we are all worried about the boom and bust scenario and all the problems associated with that. We have families who cannot afford a house and people are finding it very difficult to get a home. I know that from my clinics in my area and from talking to the wider community. We need to address this issue as well, but we also need to address the issue of discrimination against poorer families and people in the rental sector who do not have any rights. A Cheann Comhairle, am I okay for time?

To return to the Bill, section 1 extends the application of Part III of the Central Bank Act 1971 to building societies as well as banks. At present there is only one remaining building society in the State, ICS Building Society. This section will enable the transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to Part III of the 1971 Act from building societies to banks. Section 2 enables payment to be made out of the Central Fund to an account established by the ESM as the agent on behalf of the euro area member states to receive payments for the purpose of providing financial assistance to Greece. These payments are to be made in an amount equivalent to the income that accrues to the Central Bank of Ireland from the securities market programme portfolio of the Greek government debt. These are the two main sections in the Bill.  I welcome the debate on this issue. We need to be sensible. We need to put forward solutions as well as being critical. We also need to be strongly critical of some of the mad decisions that were made in the past and we need to ensure that such decisions will not be repeated. I hope the Government listens to some of the ideas I put forward in the debate on this Bill.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	330	On behalf of the Minister for Finance, I would like to thank the House for agreeing to discuss the Central Bank Bill 2014 at such short notice. As the Members know, the enactment of this Bill is needed urgently for two reasons. The first is the need to extend Part III of the Central Bank Act 1971 in order that it will apply to building societies as well as to banks.Specifically, this will make provision for the effective and expeditious transfer of the business and other assets and liabilities of building societies. For these and other purposes, the Bill will amend the Central Bank Act 1971. This legislation must be in place by the end of this month to allow the Bank of Ireland to meet its 30 June 2014 deadline under its revised restructuring plan for the disposal of certain assets of the ICS Building Society. There is also a need for legislative provision for Ireland's contribution to the securities market programme, SMP, income measure for Greece before our first payment is due to be made on 1 July 2014. I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their constructive and considered contributions to this discussion. All Deputies who contributed have the best interests of Europe, the euro area, Ireland and Greece at heart. There has been a healthy and constructive discussion on the Bill, as well as on the draft heads of the Bill, which were discussed at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 26 March under the Government's new pre-legislative scrutiny process. Concern was expressed today that mortgages with ICS Building Society are likely to be sold to an unregulated financial services provider. It is important that such concerns are not overdone and that we avoid generating unnecessary concern on the part of mortgage holders. The core of what is required to be sold under the amended restructuring plan agreed between Bank of Ireland and the European Commission is the ICS platform. The purchaser has the option to acquire up to €1 billion par value of mortgages out of the €6 billion mortgage book held by ICS Building Society. It is not clear yet whether any of the mortgages will be sold, still less whether any of the mortgages will be sold to a purchaser that is not a regulated financial service provider. It is also important to remember what the legislation that we are debating will permit. The Bill, if enacted, will permit the transfer of assets and liabilities from ICS Building Society to a bank. All banks are regulated financial service providers and all banks are required to comply with the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears. It is clear that for most people who hold mortgages with ICS Building Society, nothing significant will change. They will transfer from ICS Building Society to Bank of Ireland. The Department of Finance has confirmed that mortgagors in Bank of Ireland are treated in the same way as mortgagors in ICS Building Society, so mortgagors will not be treated any differently as a consequence of the transfer. The sale of the ICS platform will enhance competition in the mortgage market and will facilitate either a new entrant to the market or the expansion of the presence of an existing market participant. This will benefit consumers and borrowers throughout the market as a whole. Competition is necessary to ensure lenders do not have a free hand when dealing with their customers, and they must be conscious that alternative lenders are available to consumers in their dealings with them. Along with an appropriate regulatory framework, competition is also therefore an important element of proper consumer protection. It is important that the provision of mortgage credit be facilitated and that robust competition be encouraged in this sector for the benefit of consumers generally. As has been outlined, it is anticipated that an application will be made to the Minister for Finance to transfer the bulk of the assets of ICS Building Society to Bank of Ireland. It is further anticipated, though not certain, that an onward sale of some mortgage assets might subsequently occur. Such an onward sale would likely take place under the normal contractual rules rather than any statutory mechanism. However, the legislation itself will facilitate a transfer of the mortgages only to a bank; in this case, it is expected to be Bank of Ireland. Even if there were a subsequent transfer of mortgages to an unregulated financial service provider, the House is aware that the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill, which is listed in the Government's legislative programme, is intended to address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the code after the sale of loan books to unregulated entities. As has already been indicated, the Government is committed to bringing forward legislation to protect mortgage holders and will work with other interested parties to achieve the best solution for consumers. Officials in the Department of Finance are actively examining this in consultation with the Central Bank and the Office of the Attorney General with a view to bringing forward legislation to address this issue. It is intended this legislation will apply to all loans which were issued by a regulated financial service provider and subsequently transferred to a unregulated purchaser. The SMP measure arises as a result of our successful exit at the end of last year from our programme. It is, in any event, appropriate and important that we should participate in this measure. It is designed to offer further assistance to Greece, a country in far greater need than ourselves. As has been outlined, the SMP income measure forms part of a larger package of measures designed to put Greece back on track to financial stability. I note that some Deputies raised the issue of whether Ireland should also seek this concession. In this context I will repeat what has been stated before. This SMP measure formed part of a series of measures designed specifically for Greece. The measures were in the context of statements by the euro area Heads of State and Government that Greece's problems were of a scale which required special attention. This was agreed in November 2012, and our need at that time was different from that of Greece. We were preparing for our exit. We have exited our programme successfully and we are firmly back in the markets. While we still face big challenges, our needs are different from those of Greece, and we should remember this. Although there are some signs of recovery in Greece, it is important to remember that Ireland is not Greece.  Over the period 2014 to 2025, under this measure, Ireland is expected to provide just under €126 million by way of the intermediate account for the benefit of Greece. The amounts will be provided to Greece subject to satisfaction of programme conditionality and the continuation of reforms under post-programme surveillance. Overall, the euro area member states will provide just over €10 billion to the account. In 2013, when Ireland was not required to participate in this process, just over €2 billion was provided under this measure. I emphasise that our participation in the SMP measure is a consequence of our success - that is to say, our exit from our programme last year. As the House is aware, there is an urgency to both measures in the Bill. I thank the House for its time and Members for their contributions, and I commend the Bill to the House.

For the most part it is a tribute to the people in the midlands - in Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and elsewhere - who have campaigned and forced this issue onto the agenda. Neither they nor I are opposed to the development of renewable energy resources, but major questions arise in the development of those resources about the impact on local communities, about proper public consultation with those communities, about health and safety issues and about the efficiency and viability of this industrialised, corporatist approach to developing renewable energy resources. The bottom line is that the Government has not done its homework in these areas in order to establish the case for these things, to set out a regime which ensures proper environmental protection, proper consideration of local communities and indeed, the business case for the real environmental efficiency of these huge turbines. I learned the simple fact today that a wind turbine requires 200 tonnes of concrete to construct it and every tonne of concrete results in one tonne of carbon dioxide. Given the relatively short life span of wind turbines, even there one can see there will be serious problems, not to mention construction and transport costs and the infrequency of wind. These are major issues that need to be considered. This is true not just in the midlands but also for the Dublin Array project - that is, the plan to put one of the biggest wind farms in the world a very short distance off the coast in Dublin Bay in a way that could be seriously detrimental to that bay as an amenity. It could well be a case of cutting off one's nose to spite one's face, because the damage to a tourism amenity and a piece of heritage could far outweigh any supposed or spurious economic advantage. I am ringing alarm bells about the corporatist and industrialised approach to developing renewable energy resources. That is not the way to go. One of the players in this is Element Power, previously owned by the person who owned SWS Energy, who got the interconnector rights for wind energy into the national grid from, as I understand it, Noel Dempsey. He got them for a song - a few million euro - but recently sold them to Bord Gáis for half a billion euro. The company happens to be owned by someone who was a former Fine Gael candidate or somebody very close to Fine Gael. This is the sort of information that needs to be examined. Was a tender in place for those interconnector rights? Was there an open competition? Is this another case similar to that of Eircom, in which people are plundering natural resources for their own profit and not for the benefit of our economy, our society or our environment?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	334	I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing the Bill. Hopefully the reason is genuine and is not connected to the local elections. Its agreement to the set back distances and the provisions relating to noise and shadow flicker are welcome. We do not seem to have a developed energy strategy - not that it is easy to have one, given that so many things have been changing so fast in the past few years. Before we proceed with building more wind turbines on land in particular, we have to give serious consideration to other options, given the concern about the volatility of wind power. In view of the fact that we are on an island with 3,000 miles of Atlantic to the west, it is strange that we consider wave power as something beyond affordability. It deserves further research. There is little doubt that the Aarhus Convention was contravened with regard to the proposed wind turbines in the midlands. The convention demands access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice. The level of consultation in this process is very weak. It would be nice if the Government were to change its stance and give people more say in what happens in their communities. The same topic is relevant to the EirGrid project. Too often, significant decisions seem to be made and one wonders if the Government believes what it is doing is for the best, as it appears sometimes to be driven by pressure from big business. This is not always the case, but in this case there are some grounds for concern. More thought needs to be given to this project rather than giving in to the pressure of some serious players. Another issue is the engagement of Statoil and Norway in the wind project. They are doing some work with Scotland. They are working at sea using a process that does not require the turbines to be anchored to the sea bed, which is an expensive system. We have a significant resource in the seas around the west coast, and this project should be considered before we destroy the landscape for all and sundry.

There are proposals to develop industrial-style wind farms. The most significant development in recent months is the decision by the British Government not to go ahead with the agreement with the State for the purchase of the energy produced. That is probably what will save the communities across the Midlands and will have the biggest impact, because it was wrong. I believe the Bill should go further with regard to noise and shadow flicker. The proposers of wind farm developments should model their developments in such a way that a turbine is not placed within a distance of a house that could cause noise or shadow flicker to affect it. Distances can be set such as ten times the turbine height, but given the topography of the land, that could still provide for flicker and noise. Developers should be able to model those conditions and assure local communities that there will not be any noise or flicker. That should be in the regulations, rather than set distances. Obviously, it will be different for each development, depending on the topography, but that should be developed. The Bill should also state that the environmental impact assessment should be carried out by the local authority independently of the development, with the developer paying the cost. I have yet to read an environmental impact assessment that stated that a development should not go ahead due to its impact on the area, because they are paid for by the developers. He who pays the piper calls the tune; therefore, the report will always state that the development can go ahead and that it will not have an impact on the environment. That is something that should be in law, and I believe it is European Union law. The Government involved itself in some gymnastics about a year and a half ago in interpreting EU law to prevent that from being done. It should be in the legislation, and if the Bill moves forward to Committee Stage, I will be tabling amendments in that regard.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It gives all of us an opportunity not only to debate the issues with regard to wind energy but also to outline our views on other renewable alternatives and methods of electricity generation that should be considered. I read some statistics from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland which stated clearly that renewable energy has to date saved Ireland over €1 billion in fossil fuel imports. Ireland's dependence on the importation of fossil fuels stood at 85% in 2012; it was 90% in 2006. We spend over €6.5 billion per year on fossil fuel imports. It is clear to me, therefore, that that level of importation of fossil fuels is not sustainable in the longer term. Given the political and social uncertainties with regard to the provision of oil and gas, as an island we risk further exposure in terms of energy security and energy prices. We have commitments also under the climate change arrangements we have engaged in to decarbonise our energy sector and considerably reduce our carbon emissions by 2020. We must therefore look across all sectors of the economy to find areas in which renewable energy sources can be utilised. The main contributing sectors to carbon emissions in Ireland are agriculture, transport, and energy. With regard to agriculture, we have ambitious targets for Harvest 2020 in the areas of beef and dairy production. I hear Deputies from all sides of the House calling for action on climate change, but when we have realistic propositions to reduce our carbon footprint, they oppose those projects. Wind energy is a perfect example of that. If we wanted nuclear energy in this country in the morning, I suspect the same Deputies would be jumping up and down about it. As politicians, we must show some leadership and not just tell people what they want to hear if we are serious about reducing our carbon emissions. I welcome that the Minister and the Government are listening to genuine concerns with regard to wind farms, and communities are voicing those concerns. In that respect, I welcome the revised planning guidelines, about which the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is currently in consultation. I hope those consultations will address many of the concerns of communities and the general public. I welcome also the recent announcement by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, that he intends to publish a Green Paper on energy provision. That will give all stakeholders an opportunity to engage in that process and voice their opinions on how they see us providing energy security in this island nation for the next 20, 30, 40 or 50 years. We have commitments with regard to decarbonisation. We have exposures to risk in the sense of dependence on fossil fuels, and we have opportunities to maximise the potential of our natural resources. I am disappointed that some politicians take the populist line almost all the time, telling people what they want to hear. They call for climate change action but then oppose renewable energy projects. What we need is vision and leadership. We need a rational debate on energy security not only in this country but globally. We need a rational debate on climate change also. As I said, three sectors contribute to carbon emissions here, the first of which is agriculture, on which we are very dependent as an economy for recovery and growth. In terms of transport, we are limited as an island nation in reducing our carbon emissions. There is very slow progress in the area of e-cars. I would like to see more of them, but that would not put a dent in the targets we need to achieve. Energy is the third sector. When we talk about energy we must look at all the alternatives. Biomass is being proposed as one solution. Issues arise in that regard around security of supply and the supply chain for biomass, but I have said publicly that I am in support of wind farms where they are properly planned and managed and they do not have a negative impact on communities. That is the reason we need strong planning guidelines and that is why the Minister is bringing forward these guidelines, but as politicians we cannot have it every way. The time will come when the Opposition Members present, who may be in government in the future, will regret the day we did not take action on climate change and reducing our carbon emissions. I accept the genuine concerns of the Opposition and the reason this Bill has been introduced, but my understanding is that if the Bill was implemented in the morning, it could wipe out this country's entire potential for realistic wind generation. I have concerns about the Bill. I understand the Government is allowing it to pass Second Stage, but there is a further opportunity now, with the Green Paper on energy and the planning guidelines, to try to address the concerns of communities. However, the energy security issue this country faces requires a wide-ranging, diverse response that includes wind energy, biomass and geothermal energy and that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels if we are to have a competitive, secure industry in the future. I wish the Minister of State well with her planning guidelines. I hope the wider public will see that they are a genuine effort to address people's concerns and that they will provide opportunities for local authorities, and An Bord Pleanála, to manage the development of wind energy here in a responsible manner. That is the type of leadership we need. This country faces serious challenges economically, in energy terms and with regard to climate change. We cannot be all things to everyone, and I say that to politicians of all persuasions and none. We need to show leadership on this issue.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	345	I too welcome the opportunity to contribute. I thank the Sinn Féin Party for bringing forward this Bill, which focuses on the challenge of capitalising on our wind resource while taking into account the possible negative impacts that unregulated, uncontrolled development of the wind sector could have on communities. I wholeheartedly agree with almost everything Deputy Coffey said. It is impossible to exist on this planet without having an impact.The agriculture committee is currently discussing land use and how best we can reconcile our climate change 2020 obligations with our Food Harvest 2020 targets to increase production and exports from the agrifood sector. The marine harvest initiatives will also have an impact. Back in my early political days on Wicklow County Council, I recall members of the Green Party deriding the council and other local authorities for not having a wind energy strategy. Having wind farms were all flavour of the month until people started to have problems with them. As well as the large multiple corporate wind farms, small units have been built which have proved to be economically viable, enhancing income for local communities and farmers with small holdings. The Minister of State has stated she will not oppose the Bill in good faith rather than for any political gain. Last December, a consultation process on wind turbine regulation was started with a closing date of February 2014. From this, guidelines will be put in place dealing with the specific issues of turbine noise, set back and shadow flicker. The recommendation is for a statutory minimum 500 m distance from the nearest residence. However, it is not just about simply imposing a minimum distance as there are other environmental concerns such as noise and shadow flicker which must be dealt with too. As a Member opposite stated earlier, topography can result in noise sometimes bouncing much further from its source. There is an onus on us to capitalise on our wind energy resource. We must put paid to the propaganda, however, that the proposed roll-out of more pylons is needed simply for the electricity that will be generated by wind farms. I understand Gate 3 can be accommodated under the current EirGrid network. The whole purpose of the proposed pylon roll-out is to facilitate faster transmission from power stations to areas, particularly in the event of a station being forced to go offline. Water and energy infrastructure are generally what foreign direct investors will examine to ensure their businesses can operate successfully without the lights going out or the water being unsafe. Neither can we continue to depend on fossil fuels, which come from sources in some volatile parts of the world, while turning our back on indigenous energy resources. During the middle of the Crimean crisis, the US President, Mr. Obama, made the point that it is up to countries to ensure their energy supplies are secure. While I, along with Deputy Colreavy and others on the Border in County Leitrim, have a problem with fracking, the point was made that states needed to get their own energy supplies and not depend on gas coming through a pipeline from Russia that may become unaffordable due to developments in international relations. Driving through a certain county in the midlands recently, I saw a poster proclaiming, “No AD here”. I first thought it was me, Andrew Doyle, but it was actually anaerobic digestion. There will always be someone saying “No” to something. Somewhere along the way we need to be responsible and take good regard of the environment. At the last Dáil’s climate change committee, the director of Trócaire was asked about birth control in the Third World. He pointed out the average carbon emission from an individual in the United States is 20 tonnes, in Europe 12 tonnes and in the Third World 0.87 tonnes, which begs the question where should birth control be imposed if we want to prevent climate change. These are the kinds of arguments we get into if we get silly about this issue.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the Wind Turbine Regulation Bill 2012 and thank Deputies Colreavy and Stanley for introducing it. Its subject matter is relevant to my constituents in Meath East and Meath West. While I welcome the Bill, I am disappointed but not surprised it has been used as another political football. Last night, I listened to accusations from opposite that Fine Gael councillors in County Meath were working for wind energy companies, an unfounded claim with no merit. I disagree with being accused of staying quiet and not standing up for the people in my community. If some of those opposite were on these benches, we would be listening to a different story. I am a member of the transport and communications committee. This morning, the committee heard from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland which stated we need to develop renewable energy resources as part of our overall energy strategy to help us meet our 2020 renewable energy targets. Ireland has an abundance of wind, a significant natural energy resource. Some claim we should examine other sources such as tidal and offshore. While much work is being done in these areas, these sources will not produce enough to meet our 2020 targets. Jobs, revenue and lower carbon emissions will be some of the benefits from wind energy. Harnessing this energy source must be done in a holistic way while addressing community concerns about the location of wind turbines and optimising the benefits clearly for everyone. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources alluded to this when he said nothing will happen on the intergovernmental agreement on wind energy until the benefits are seen. Unfortunately, where we fall down on this is in communication as has happened in Meath with the proposed roll-out of next-generation pylons. When there is a lack of communication, misinformation starts to appear with people getting confused and angry. We need to communicate the benefits of renewable energy to the public, as well as how the projects will impact on the ground. Recently, I saw a newsletter in my area containing a map of 250 possible sites for wind farms there. As long as I am a Deputy and living in Meath, there will never be 250 turbines in the county. This is again, however, due to a lack of communication breeding misinformation which causes problems. There are also concerns about the height of turbines, set back distances and their possible effects on agriculture and the equine industry. In my constituency, the set back distance is the most prevalent issue. The proposed 500 m set back distance from the nearest dwelling is believed to be still too close. We have to be realistic about this issue, however, too. Many areas in Meath have high housing density. Putting an unrealistic set back distance could mean we would have no renewable energy at all. We need to examine the conflicting information on noise levels from wind turbines. Modern turbines have the facility to measure sunlight levels which can be used to address the whole issue of shadow flicker. It is important we do not make the same mistakes that were made in many other countries. The decisions we make on wind turbine regulation must be built on lessons learned elsewhere. The lack of information and engagement has been the main cause of concern.The aim of the recent review by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, of the 2006 wind energy guidelines, which received over 7,000 submissions, is to implement best practice guidelines for wind development. The review of the guidelines is welcome, but we must ensure proper regulation is enforced. I am also pleased to hear that the strategic environmental assessment scoping report has now been prepared and that we will have a report, public consultation and a cost-benefit analysis in the coming phases of the project. While I agree with some of the information in this Bill, much of it is negative. To return to what Deputy Doyle said, we cannot depend on fossil fuels or on energy from other countries. We cannot stand still; we must move with the times. Unfortunately, if we stand still, we will not be able to function properly in the coming years. Many of the projects being proposed will be beneficial for the country and will help secure our future energy needs and provide jobs and money for the economy. However, energy provision must be secured in a transparent and fair manner. I believe that is what will happen.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	I have a number of concerns with regard to this draft Bill. The way the Bill has been drafted by Sinn Féin suggests that the current position is that when county councils or An Bord Pleanála are considering planning applications for wind farms, no regard is given to human beings, their health or the environment, and that somehow this Bill will champion those considerations. This is absolutely untrue. The truth is that we have a robust, transparent planning system which is backed up by the Department's wind energy development guidelines for planning authorities, dating back to 2006. Furthermore, existing planning legislation is principle-based and requires that wind energy developments demonstrate environmental benefits and minimise environmental and social impacts through careful consideration of location, scale and design. Many people who have been involved in trying to promote and develop wind farms have felt the disdain of An Bord Pleanála and planning authorities when they did not meet the high standards currently in place and were refused planning permission. The context in which this is Bill is set out is misleading. I am seriously concerned that the Bill attempts to deal with issues such as distance from housing, noise and shadow flicker, issues which are currently under review as part of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's consultation and proposed revision to the 2006 wind energy guidelines. Has Sinn Féin no respect for the views of the many private citizens and other stakeholders who took the time to make a submission in this consultation? Why has it not waited for the outcome of the review before drafting any document on wind, let alone legislation? I have heard Sinn Féin refer to the Aarhus Convention and the need for proper consultation with the public many times, yet when the public is consulted, Sinn Féin does not have the patience to wait to hear the result of the review.

#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	349	It seems that when it comes to Sinn Féin, this does not apply. All the focus on the export of wind energy is crazy and misleading. The reality is that we are building wind farms at such a slow rate each year that we will do well to meet our legally binding domestic renewable energy targets by 2020. The Bill ignores the fact that the European Union is moving towards a single electricity market, which envisages the movement of electricity generated from one member state to another. This should assist with energy security and price. We already operate a single electricity market with Northern Ireland, but this Bill is totally divorced from this reality. The Bill refers to set back distances, but what technical or engineering rationale or evidence explains the set back distances Sinn Féin has come up with? Surely, also, there are other factors to be taken into account apart from set back distances. For example, if there is a hill between my house and a turbine, there may be no visual amenity impact, compared with the impact on someone whose home may be the same distance from the turbine as mine as the crow flies but over flat land. Surely this and other factors should be taken into account rather than set back distance alone. I know people in my constituency who live far closer than 500 m to a wind farm and who are happy to do so. Therefore, I do not accept that set back distance is the only way to go. The Bill stipulates that the standard for noise limits from wind turbines should not exceed those specified in the World Health Organization guidelines for community noise. Has Sinn Féin considered the fact that these noise limits are already included in the 2006 wind energy guidelines? Instead of being honest with the many people around the country who have understandable concerns and fears about wind farms and other energy infrastructure being constructed in their communities, Sinn Féin is capitalising on their fears or misery, all in the interest of political gain from its populist position. Sinn Féin's national policy is pro wind, yet it is against every proposed wind farm project around the country.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	359	Undoubtedly, the public debate surrounding wind turbines, which has been going on for some time, has been heated and passionate and at times somewhat less than objective. I say this following a number of public meetings in my constituency and beyond. I am sure my constituency colleague, Deputy Stanley, can testify that the meetings have been heated and difficult and have been noted for the amount of information that was not forthcoming rather than the amount placed before the communities. I believe it is important that we have a calm and honest debate on the future of renewable energy, and from that perspective I welcome the Bill and this debate. Some 86% of the national energy requirement is imported, at a cost to the State of more than €6.2 billion per annum. By 2020, it is envisaged that one-third of electricity consumed here will come from a renewable source. Our 2020 targets must be met and we must discuss how this can be done without an adverse impact on local communities. Some wind development companies have shown little regard for the consultation process that must occur if communities are to be convinced of the need for them and if calm is to prevail. This lack of regard has led to an element of fear and mistrust in these communities, which has given rise to a plethora of misinformation regarding wind energy and wind turbines. I believe people should be allowed make a real and meaningful contribution to the process, and for that reason I welcome the current consultation. This consultation allowed for public submissions and I and other colleagues made submissions to it. I expressed concerns in two particular areas regarding the impact wind turbines will have on rural communities in my constituency and beyond. First, under the review of wind energy guidelines, I have called for thoroughbred stud farms and horse racing training facilities to be included under the definition of noise-sensitive properties. Ireland is a world leader in this field when it comes to producing brood mares, racehorses and stallions.The industry employs more than 14,000 people and makes a direct economic contribution of more than €1 billion per annum to the economy. The main concerns expressed by the industry are that the location of wind farms close to stud farms would have an unsettling effect on bloodstock. A special case must be made for bloodstock as horses are extremely sensitive. Leading bloodstock experts believe the close proximity of wind turbines would lead to horses reacting unfavourably owing to increased noise, the rotation of the wind turbines and the movement of shadows cast by the blades. I made a separate submission on the close proximity of wind turbines to rural dwellings. I say this as a public representative from a mainly rural constituency in the midlands that is engaged in a very heated debate on the pros and cons of turbines. The proposals made by wind farm development companies could see turbines in excess of 180 m high located in my constituency. The increase in the recommended set back from wind turbines from 250 m to 500 m was an acknowledgement by the authors of the revised wind energy guidelines that wind farms should be located at an appropriate distance from residential areas. I am concerned about the size and scale of some of the turbines. While the minimum set back is preferable, consideration must also be given to allowing a set back distance that would correlate with the height of the proposed turbines and applying the appropriate separation distance from a residential area of special amenity value. I am pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, yesterday acknowledged that this point required at least further consideration. In the matter of the recommended set back distance we must consider a study by the All-Island Research Observatory, AIRO, in Maynooth that states a set back distance of 2 km would leave a mere 3% of the total land area of the country available to wind farm development. I would like to hear the views of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, following the decision by the Irish and British Governments not to proceed with the intergovernmental agreement and the consequences this will have for wind turbine developments in the midlands.  I welcome this debate. While I do not agree with much of the legislation, it is important that we attempt in this House to achieve a level of consensus on an important industry that has given rise to serious and justifiable concerns up and down the country, in particular my constituency.

#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	364	In my constituency, Cork East, there are plans for 11 wind turbines. I applaud the residents of that rural area who have run an effective and informative campaign. I attended their public meetings and was surprised at the level of support the campaign had received. I will continue to work with them until the matter is brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The blame for the fear and confusion in communities lies fairly and squarely at the door of the Government. While I welcome its commitment not to oppose the Bill, I sound a word of caution. This must not be a hollow election promise. The Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte's record on election promises leaves much to be desired. The Bill must be progressed as quickly as possible and part of an overall energy strategy. The Minister should make it an imperative to introduce a Green Paper on energy strategy. Unfortunately, the Government appears not to be interested in developing any such strategy. In the memorandum of understanding signed by the Minister and the British Government in January 2013 it was agreed to export wind energy produced in Ireland to Britain. The memorandum collapsed in March 2014 because of the failure to reach economic agreement on the export of energy. It did not make economic or environmental sense to export renewable energy from Ireland when we relied so heavily on fossil fuel consumption. There are signs that the Government wants to re-engage with the British in an attempt to generate wind energy for export from Ireland. This gombeen politics smacks of banana republic economics. The goal of generating 16% of energy from renewable resources by 2020 will not be reached if the Government continues frantically to sell off energy generated by wind turbines. The Bill is a reasonable response to that challenge. The Bill would prevent the Government from undermining local authority development plans under the Planning and Development Act 2006 which gives power to local government to zone specific areas for the erection of wind turbines. The Bill would strengthen local democracy and accountability. It would ensure any person applying for permission to construct a turbine or wind farm would have to provide information for local residents through placing an advertisement in a local newspaper and placing a sign on the proposed site. Any change that would be made to land or location would be made available to the public, with an Ordnance Survey map pointing to the locations of the turbines. The length of time the construction work would take would be made known to the public. An outline of any planning gain would have to be made available to the public. Following the situation in Ukraine there has been much discussion at a European level about energy security in Europe. This issue is likely to develop further if relations between the West and Russia remain cold. There is significant worry in Europe about the possible loss of Russian gas. Sinn Féin has always argued for the development of renewable energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels. However, there must be a varying amount of renewable energy sources. Ireland cannot rely on wind energy alone and to guarantee energy security, it must vary its renewable energy potential. Alternative sources must be explored to guarantee the security of supply into the future. The Government should adopt self-sustainability in energy production and consumption as a long-term goal in its energy strategy. The State is 87.5% reliant on fossil fuels for energy production, the vast majority of which is imported. This is costing consumers money as fossil fuel prices are determined by the whims of international markets. This results in fuel poverty being a problem in Ireland, with the country recording a significant number of excess winter deaths each year. The Bill would restrict the Government's export of renewable energy until Ireland's energy demands had been met. It is a solution-based, reasonable response to the challenges at local, national and international level.

The Government does not oppose its passage on Second Stage and while that is welcome, the Fine Gael mask on this issue slipped tonight in Deputy Michelle Mulherin's contribution. Not opposing the Bill is not enough. If the Government is sincere, it should ensure Committee and Report Stages are progressed and the Bill is enacted. However, we may yet have another cynical ploy on its part to allow the Bill to pass Second Stage but then shelve it, giving the public the impression before the local elections that it will be enacted at some future stage. While I hope not, I fear that may be the case. In previous Dáileanna we warned of what was to come if the so-called "critical infrastructure" legislation of the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government was passed. It was designed to ride roughshod over the planning process, elected councillors and local and regional communities. One result was one of the most major planning scandals ever, namely, the Poolbeg incinerator project. Nearly €100 million of public money was spent on it and not one block was laid for an unnecessary incinerator that nobody wanted and against which the elected members of the relevant local authority had repeatedly voted.If the proposed network of gigantic wind turbines across the midlands is allowed to go ahead, facilitated by that same strategic infrastructure legislation, it will be another massive scandal. It is ironic when Fáilte Ireland and the entire tourism industry is trying to attract tourists, both foreign and domestic, to the less visited parts of Ireland that it is proposed effectively to industrialise significant swathes of the landscape across the middle counties of Ireland. It seems to be accepted by the so-called planners at national level that these landscapes are less attractive than lofty mountains and coastlines with cliffs and harbours that have expansive ocean vistas, and therefore these midland counties can be blighted with giant wind turbines. Only this week the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, opened a section of a new cycle and walking route planned to traverse the country, which will attract visitors and open less visited parts of Ireland. That is welcome. The scale of what is planned is enormous but I doubt many people outside the affected communities realise the extent of what is to be imposed. We are talking about approximately 2,000 massive turbines across counties Laois, Offaly, Westmeath, Kildare and Meath, and we should, just for a moment, imagine the potential impact. The supreme irony is that this is not to meet the demands for sustainable energy sources for our country but to generate electricity for export to Britain, with the private companies involved engaged in a purely profit-making exercise. The attempt to put a green gloss on this is just that, a cheap paint job in an attempt to disguise the ugly reality. This Bill would ensure that sustainable energy generated through properly planned wind turbines cannot be exported abroad when this State has yet to meet its own sustainable energy targets. It would force companies wishing to develop industrial wind farms to advise, consult with and have proper regard for host communities. It would ensure local authorities could, by law, force companies to meet the cost of repairing or upgrading local infrastructure during the construction of industrial wind farms, and that the same companies were responsible for recycling wind farms when they were decommissioned. Ultimately, we want to see a halt to the privatisation of our natural resources, including wind energy, and we want to see them employed to the collective benefit of Ireland Inc., or the people. Sinn Féin will continue to campaign for this Bill to be enacted and enforced after this debate.

Nuair a chuala mé aréir go raibh an Rialtas ag tabhairt tacaíochta don Bhille, bhí mé an-sásta, ach tar éis a bheith ag éisteacht leis an méid a bhí le rá ag cuid de chomhghleacaithe an Aire Stáit as Páirtí Fhine Gael, tá sé iontach soiléir nach bhfuil an páirtí sin ag tabhairt tacaíochta don Bhille, ach go bhfuil sé ag tabhairt tacaíochta dó anocht sa dóigh agus go mbeidh a gcomhairleoirí contae ar an talamh, atá faoi bhrú mór ag bailte áitiúla agus ag grúpaí áitiúla glacadh leis na treoirlínte seo. Ach tá sé iontach soiléir nach bhfuil an Rialtas i ndáiríre faoin reachtaíocht seo agus go suífidh an reachtaíocht fada go leor gan dul go dtí an chéad chéim eile, Céim an Choiste.
I welcome this legislation, as much work by the office of Deputies Colreavy and Stanley has gone into it, and I also acknowledge Councillor Matt Carthy in the Gallery, who was involved in the submission to the Department and had some of the input to the legislation. There has been much work done and if people took the time to read the legislation, they would see there was extensive consultation along the midlands in particular. Nevertheless, it was not exclusively in the midlands as the issue of wind farm development is not a preserve of the area, although the proposals there are frightening to say the least. The issue has impacted in a negative sense in my county, although there has been a positive impact in some sense as we need to have renewable energy. I welcome the development of wind farms in tandem with local needs but there are cases where local communities, activists and ordinary people have had to come together and become experts in how to take on the major farm developers, going as far as An Bord Pleanála oral hearings, with all the associated costs. Those of us in this House, and particularly this and previous Governments, have failed to deal with the issue in a proper and robust manner, which is why Sinn Féin has brought forward this legislation. It removes the issue from the sphere of guidelines and places it into legislation, as Deputy McLellan noted. It is alarming, given the salary earned by Deputies and the resources all of us enjoy in terms of support staff, that a certain Deputy can come to this Chamber and peddle the mistruths we have heard from Fine Gael backbenches, both from an economic policy perspective and with regard to wind energy. Last night, the Minister of State in her contribution stated that she appreciated the view of Members who advocated for a legislative approach, which has merit, yet Deputy Mulherin believes there is no merit whatever in the legislative approach. This legislation makes sense and covers a wide range of areas, including excess energy, and nobody could argue that we should export energy before our own needs are met. We seek to empower local authorities and councillors in determining where wind farms are best placed - or particularly where they should not be placed - in their county. This should not be circumvented by the critical infrastructure Bill or decisions by An Bord Pleanála. Nobody in this House could object to proper public consultation, with the public being informed of the potential impact of construction stages and wind farm operations. Nobody would have an issue with the World Health Organization's guidelines being implemented with respect to minimum noise or the removal of flicker, as it has an effect on people with autism and epilepsy. I do not wish to focus on Deputy Mulherin but I would love to see the mountain she is talking about where a wind farm is blocked despite being only 500 m. away. It must be a very thin mountain. Perhaps she will invite me to Mayo to see these unique mountains, as they could be one of the wonders of the world. This is a very measured proposal based on international best practice, as the height of a turbine would be used in measuring set back distance. This is not a blunt instrument but a well thought out measure. The legislation also deals with destruction that comes about when the construction and maintenance of these farms is ongoing. Local roads are destroyed, and we know that because of the cuts implemented by the Government, local authorities are starved of funding to deal with the problem. They cannot fix the potholes or the craters in local roads leading to wind farm developments that are also used by people in the community. This is very sensible legislation and I hope the Government will have courage in its conviction and not just support this in theory to save the blushes of elected councillors and candidates across the State who are facing pressure from communities who know this legislation makes sense. The Government should do the right thing and allow this to go as soon as possible to Committee Stage. Let us tease out this issue properly and bring forward a legislative basis to ensure wind farms can be developed while protecting vulnerable people, local infrastructure and the communities.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	367	Like others I am happy to hear that the Government will support the Bill. It is a positive development and the first time the Government has backed a Sinn Féin Bill in this session. I hope it demonstrates some political maturity on behalf of the Government and it will be a turning point. Most of us in here are faced every day with problems in people's lives and as legislators we are asked to formulate solutions. Deputy Colreavy has tried to put forward an alternative view that can help people and communities. There is a dearth of information on this matter.Other speakers have talked about some of the public meetings that have taken place. People are naturally concerned about what is happening, how it will develop and the impact it will have on them, their families, their livelihoods and their communities. It has to offer some collective benefit to Irish society, which should be for the community, not for a handful of large investors. That has to be a key component of these new technologies, if we are going to roll them out.  Climate change is one of the most important issues we must tackle today. If we do not reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and look to improving our renewable energy potential, it will be a disaster not just for the country but for the planet. As an island on the western edge of Europe, we have huge potential to produce a range of renewable energy, yet in 2012 a total of 87.5% of our energy came from fossil fuels and only 11.4% from renewable sources. These figures highlight the potential for us to roll out these new technologies. Although the economy has a strong agricultural sector, the proportion of renewable energy produced from biomass and waste is already below the EU average. If other countries are investing in this area, why is Ireland not doing so? We need to roll that out in communities and reassure people about what these new technologies involve. It is estimated that tidal energy has the potential to generate almost 75% of Ireland’s electricity demand. Some people say we are only developing this area, but it needs to be done.  Wind energy is quite unpredictable and the building of wind turbines needs to be strictly regulated. I welcome the fact that the Bill includes the need for meaningful consultation between companies and communities on the building of wind turbines. Wind turbine development should proceed only with the agreement of the host community and it should not be the case that one individual farmer can impinge on the rights of neighbouring farms by allowing developments to proceed without general agreement. Communities should pull together, agree and move forward. A key part of international relations in the 21st century is energy security, because we are so dependent on energy to run our daily lives. It is important that we are not over dependent on one energy source or on one country to provide us with our energy needs. Renewable energy offers a fantastic clean alternative to fossil fuels and reduces our dependence on other countries and on unstable regimes. Another factor in our high dependency on fossil fuels is their cost. Many people coming to our advice centres are terrified going to bed at night, worrying about the next bill to come through the door. We know the impact of this on their lives. According to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the average cost of energy bills has increased by over €500 in the past three years. We want to see the roll-out of new technologies, but that must involve the community, and there has to be a benefit for society as a whole.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	I also welcome the Government’s decision to allow this Bill to pass Second Stage, and I congratulate Deputy Colreavy and his office on producing it. I wish we could see more of this kind of approach from the Government in the future. I am concerned at the fact that an election looms. I hope this Bill will not be shelved after the election and will pass through the House. To show that the Government is dedicated to this policy, it would be a positive step to commence the next Stage of the Bill before the end of May. This is a well thought out, comprehensive Bill which clearly sets out a way forward for wind energy in Ireland and a path towards a fully self-sustaining Ireland that produces all the energy it needs on these islands. As set out in a memorandum of understanding with the British Government, the Irish Government originally intended to set Ireland up as an offshore wind farm for Britain. Thankfully this scheme fell through, and I hope the Government’s support for this Bill indicates a change of position on this. While revenue from such a scheme would be welcome, it would be a very unambitious approach to wind energy in Ireland. It also ignores the reality that every state must do all in its power to reduce its dependence on foreign oil and gas and to develop sustainable green energy regimes based on energy produced within the State. We cannot allow ourselves be a tool in this project for the British Government and ignore our own needs and responsibilities.  Ireland is far too dependent on imported dirty energy. This Bill sets out a path to ending that regime while creating jobs and saving money and our environment along the way. It also puts us on course to achieving the EU objective of having 16% of our energy from renewable sources by 2020. An important aspect of Sinn Féin’s vision for the development of a greener future is the use of biofuels, which have the potential to warm a significant number of homes. Residential property still has the highest demand for heat in Ireland, where homes consume twice as many tonnes of oil equivalent, TOE, as industrial and commercial buildings. Biofuel also presents opportunities for making transport cleaner and cheaper. The biofuel obligation scheme was introduced in July 2010 as the primary means for Ireland to meet the target of at least 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020, which was mandated by the 2009 renewable energy directive. The scheme works by obligating road transport fuel suppliers to bring a certain amount of biofuel, currently 6% by volume, to the market. Unfortunately, most of the biofuels used in Ireland have been imported. This Government should act to ensure greater production of biofuels. This should form an integral part of an energy strategy formed by the Government. I have met with haulier and public transport companies which all say the cost of keeping vehicles on the road is a major obstacle to the success of their companies. The rising price of fuel is a major obstacle to keeping their costs down. The Government can have little if any influence on the cost of fuel coming from halfway around the world, which is the present situation. We are at the mercy of international markets. A few years ago, Dublin Bus had reduced fuel costs by just under €10 million a year, down to 1999 levels. This was a great achievement, but the price of fuel has risen significantly in these years and the fuel bill is now €30 million more a year than it was in 1999. Support for the production and use of biofuel could really help to cut costs for these essential companies. This should be part of a wider strategy which ensures that the best, most fuel-efficient vehicles are in use. Dublin Bus has started to use hybrid vehicles which have 30% more fuel efficiency than ordinary vehicles, and this is likely to improve in the future. Through a wide-ranging focus on greater self-sufficiency and greener energy, we can make living and doing business in Ireland much better. We can fight fuel poverty and decrease pollution while providing better value public and private transport. Once again, I welcome the passing of this Bill to the next Stage and ask the Government to commit to engaging with us on reforming our energy regime.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	While welcoming the Bill and the debate last night and tonight, Deputy Coffey said we should use it as a platform for a wider debate on our energy supply and energy strategy. I agree. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, will soon publish a Green Paper on energy. Sinn Féin will make a submission on that, as it has on many previous energy issues such as EirGrid. Sinn Féin’s position on energy systems is not just a Twenty-six County position. We want to see energy security and supply achieved on an all-Ireland basis. It must be sustainable and achieved in the best interests of the citizens of this island.They are the three key issues for us. Energy security has been the subject of focus and debate recently, particularly at EU level. The North-South Interparliamentary Association recently held a very productive session on energy security. There is no doubt that renewable energy will form an important part of our energy security policy. This is made particularly clear by the figures cited by a previous speaker on our reliance on fossil fuels for 87% of our energy needs. It is important, therefore, that we approach policy development strategically in order to meet future challenges and needs. The review that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is conducting of the planning guidelines will contribute to that strategic approach. However, the Minister of State acknowledged that there is also merit in taking a legislative approach. This is what we have put to the House tonight. Deputy Mulherin described the Bill as an opportunistic effort on the part of Sinn Féin and not grounded in reality. It is clear from her contribution, however, that she did not read the Bill. That is a pity because if we are to have an informed debate on an issue as important as this, it is imperative that the people who were elected to represent the citizens of this State would at least read the legislation on which they are asked to speak or vote. The Bill contains a number of measures which warrant further discussion on Committee Stage. Public consultation is key to wind projects. Section 4 of the Bill deals with public consultation in a comprehensive and straightforward manner and it should be implemented. The section sets out a list of tasks that an individual applying for planning permission is required to complete, including placing an advertisement in a local paper and arranging public meetings to outline the plans to the local community. I welcome that the Government has agreed to allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage but I will not be happy if the legislation is left on a shelf somewhere. This issue is too important to allow that to happen. Deputies Colreavy and Stanley will be pursuing the Bill on Committee Stage to ensure it is debated at the earliest opportunity.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	370	I would like to thank Deputies for their contributions on the proposed Wind Turbine Regulation Bill 2014. The Government has listened carefully to what has been said during these debates. It is important, however, that I address some inaccuracies and misconceptions which have been aired during the course of this debate. Deputies Brian Stanley, Martin Ferris and Michael Moynihan have claimed that local communities are not being consulted in the formulation of wind energy development policy or in the consideration and development of wind farm proposals. I would like to re-emphasise that consultation with the public and local communities on the formulation of wind energy development policy is a major priority for this Government. The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, outlined in detail the two public consultations in which her Department have engaged during the current review of the wind energy development guidelines. Last December she published draft revisions to the guidelines which proposed the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 dB for future wind energy developments, a mandatory minimum setback of 500 m between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations and the complete elimination of shadow flicker. Submissions were received from 7,500 organisations and members of the public in response to these draft proposals and they will form an important input into the final version of the guidelines which the Minister of State hopes to be in a position to publish by the third quarter of this year. In addition, the existing guidelines already emphasise the need for energy companies to engage in active consultation and dialogue with local communities at the earliest possible stage on proposed wind farm developments, and ideally prior to the submission of a planning application. The Minister of State also outlined the extensive, three stage public consultation process that is currently being undertaken by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as part of its preparation of a renewable energy policy and development framework, which will be underpinned by a strategic environmental assessment. I also understand that a Green Paper on energy policy will be published shortly by that Department and comments will be invited from the public. Accordingly, I do not think the Government can reasonably be accused of not consulting with the public or not allowing for the fullest public participation in its proposed renewable energy policies, including in the area of wind. On section 2, I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Sean Fleming about an effective ban on exports of wind energy to the UK. As demonstrated by the ongoing State visit of President Higgins to the UK, Irish relations with the UK, both politically and commercially, have never been as good. A trade ban would send out the wrong signals as we seek to continue the normalisation of relations between our two islands. Electricity interconnection arrangements are already in place between Ireland and the UK and it is important that we continue to work together to develop appropriate arrangements for security of energy supply. I welcome that Deputy Sean Fleming and Fianna Fáil recognise the importance of developing a national policy on trade in renewable energy generally. Deputy Stanley described the wind energy development guidelines as voluntary or suggestive. When the revised guidelines are finalised they will be jointly issued by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála are required to have regard to the guidelines in the performance of their functions under the planning Acts. Ultimately, it will be a decision for the relevant local planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála to make decisions on individual planning applications for wind energy developments, having regard to the guidelines.  As the Minister of State indicated last night, the Government does not intend to oppose the Bill on Second Stage on the basis that the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are currently reviewing some of the issues raised. The Government will need to consider the outcomes of the consultation processes on the wind energy development guidelines and the renewable energy policy and development framework as this Bill progresses. It is important that we do not pre-empt the outcome of these important reviews and public consultations.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	371	Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom a léiriú go bhfuil mé an-sásta go bhfuil an Rialtas ag ligean don Bhille seo bogadh ar aghaidh chuig an chéad Chéim eile. Táim buíoch as sin. É sin ráite, tá súil agam go bhfuil siad dáiríre faoi seo. Mar a dúirt an Teachta O'Brien, tá súil agam nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur an Bhille seo ar leataobh go dtí go mbeidh an toghchán thart. I hope the Government is not merely kicking to touch in order to defuse a difficult issue in the run up to the local elections. The Government has to act to ensure that this Bill is progressed as quickly as possible. County and regional managers should take note of this decision by the Government and any wind turbine development plans currently under way should reflect this. I want to be clear that Sinn Féin is for developing Ireland's renewable energy potential. We are for wind energy. Freisin, tá Sinn Féin ag éisteacht le pobail ar fud na tíre. Sin an fáth go bhfuil an Bille seo curtha chun tosaigh againn. Citizens right across rural Ireland are concerned at the impact that plans for the large-scale construction of industrial wind turbines could have on their homes, on their farms and on their communities. Contrary to the Minister of State, Deputy Perry's, protestations, rural communities have struggled to get their voices heard by the Government. Fine Gael and Labour, and, before them, Fianna Fáil, have all failed local communities on this issue. In government, these parties failed to address community concerns and instead allowed the State's entire renewable energy strategy to be dictated by private wind energy firms. The Bill, which I commend - I commend our foireann, mar chuir siad é le chéile - is a common sense piece of work. It puts communities at the heart of the decision-making process. It attempts to impose proper regulation of all aspects of wind turbine construction. This includes proper zoning of areas for wind turbine developments, the duties of planning authorities, setback distances and the responsibility of decommissioning wind turbines. Proper regulation should have been in place already, and this Bill seeks to rectify the mistakes made by this and previous Governments. At present, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which was rammed through the Dáil by Fianna Fáil, can be used to override county development plans drawn up by local councils. We believe that wind farm projects must be consistent with county development plans. This Bill also restores the primacy of county development plans in that, under its provisions, wind farms must be located only in areas zoned by local councils. The Bill also seeks to ensure that Ireland's energy demands are met before renewable energy is exported. Any renewable energy which is produced here should go to lessen the fuel bills of ordinary working families. The recent sale of wind projects developed by Bord Gáis, which amounts to approximately 15% of the wind capacity from the island of Ireland, to a foreign multinational is a regressive step. As I stated, we are committed to renewable energy, but it must be led by semi-State companies such as the ESB and Bord na Móna. On privatisation, I do not blame Fine Gael. Fine Gael is clear that it is for privatisation, but the agenda on privatisation being pushed by the Fine Gael and Labour has resulted in the loss of this wind portfolio, which is a strategic asset in the production of energy on this island. The sale of this portfolio to foreign private interests, to use as they see fit, will not help our energy security. It is imperative, on top of all of this, that the Minister for Communication, Energy and Natural Resources looks at this in an all-Ireland context and that we deliver, in co-operation with our friends in the North, an all-island strategy on energy as soon as possible. We are saying clearly that further privatisation should not form part of that strategy. In this Bill, Sinn Féin is saying that proper planning is essential for major developments in rural areas. Clarity around land access and land use is essential. It is also essential that farming communities are made fully aware of the consequences of signing contracts with energy companies, and that the concerns expressed by local communities are addressed. In my view, and in the view of Sinn Féin, Deputies of all parties and none now have an opportunity to do the right thing and to stand up for communities across this State by supporting this Bill through all Stages.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-04-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	372	I begin by thanking my colleagues, Deputies Stanley and Martin Ferris, Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, as Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned, Councillor Matt Carthy, Mr. Simon Gillespie, our legal draftsman, and our own office staff because it was a true team effort in producing this piece of legislation. I welcome the Government's decision not to oppose the Bill at this Stage and thank - I was going to say all - most of the Members who spoke during the debate. There were two exceptions, one tonight and one last night, and either they had not read the Bill at all or they decided to engage in the most negative intemperate and partially hysterical political point-scoring instead of engaging in debate. Development of renewable energy should be a uniting, rather than a dividing, venture among Irish people and politicians. Most reasonable people will readily agree that it makes sense to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels by maximising our use of renewable energy sources. Wind energy pylons, after all, do not poison water; hydraulic fracturing can. We have all witnessed the people's commendable opposition to proposals to erect thousands of wind turbines in the Irish midlands and we need to look at the reasons for that opposition. People felt it necessary to take this course of action because they are naturally worried when energy companies are buying and leasing land for their wind turbines although the planning application process has not been gone through. Naturally, people are worried. I believe there are three main reasons for this mass opposition. First, there is no comprehensive national vision or strategy on renewable energy developments. In the absence of such a vision and strategy, people fear the energy companies are exploiting the vacuum in their own self-interest rather than the interest of the people of Ireland. The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, indicated he will shortly publish a Green Paper on renewable energy. I welcome that announcement and hope it will be the first step in developing a strategy that will enjoy the support of the vast majority of people and of politicians. The second reason is that the current planning guidelines are woefully inadequate in regulating wind energy projects, and do not require companies to address our domestic energy requirements before we consider exporting to other jurisdictions. Additionally, they hold no provision for specific benefits for Irish people in terms of job creation, energy pricing, financial dividend to the State, etc. We are all only too well aware of the risks inherent in giving almost uncontrolled power to private companies whose sole objective is to increase profits and dividends for shareholders. While profit-making is neither a crime nor a sin, our responsibility is to maximise the benefit for the State and its citizens. Third, if we learned anything from the Corrib oil debacle, it is that secrecy and behind-closed-doors project planning and implementation does not work. Host communities must be involved at all stages, from initial project analysis through project planning and delivery. Co-operation with communities will work far better than imposition. This Bill attempts to address some of these shortcomings. I am sure the Bill can be improved on - it is not a perfect piece of legislation - as we progress it through the later Stages. The memorandum of understanding that was signed between the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the British Government was designed to facilitate the export of renewable energy generated in Ireland to Britain for consumption there. Under an EU directive, each country has to consume a certain percentage of its energy each year from renewable sources. While the British Government was not keen on development the renewable energy infrastructure on its island in order to reach targets set out by the EU, the Irish midlands were deemed a suitable location to erect wind turbines. This plan was devised without the consent of communities in the midlands, or, indeed, in any part of Ireland. The memorandum of understanding was shelved recently, but murmurings from those in power indicate that there will be an attempt to get movement on it once again. People in the midlands and elsewhere are naturally concerned that their health, amenity and property values would be sacrificed so that we could become Britain's offshore wind farm.Contrary to what many Government Members and one from the Fianna Fáil Party said, Sinn Féin is not opposed to exporting renewable energy to Britain or anywhere else but we must deal with the facts. Of indigenous energy produced in Ireland in 2012, renewable energy accounted for 58%, peat 24% and natural gas for 14%. However, of energy consumed in Ireland, 87.5% came from fossil fuels while only 11.4% came from renewable sources. This indicates that we are still very heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels for energy. The public is constantly being told that Ireland is in a unique position to develop renewable sources of energy. While this may be true, the fact that 87.5% of our energy still comes from imported fossil fuels shows that Ireland has a long way to go in developing renewable energy for ourselves. Under EU directives, we must reach a target of 16% renewable energy consumption by 2020. We should have our own, more ambitious yet realistic targets. It has been indicated by Government that we are set to reach this goal but we are so heavily reliant on imported fossil fuel that the Government needs to develop renewable energy for Irish needs. Concerns have also been raised with regards the reliance on wind as a single source of renewable energy. To highlight the volatility of wind energy, between 2011 and 2012 wind energy produced in Ireland fell 8.4% due to differences in wind speeds. Relying too heavily on a resource that can vary so much is worrying. Let us compare this with wave and tidal energy. Tidal generation has significant advantage over many other forms of renewable generation in that it is almost perfectly forecastable over long-term horizons.  Biomass is another alternative form of renewable energy that has yet to be explored to any great extent. Ireland is a nation with a strong agricultural sector. The proportion of renewable energy produced from biomass and waste is already below the EU average. In a recently published report, BW Energy identified Moneypoint power station as an ideal location for conversion into a biomass generation system. This discussion must form part of a wider debate on energy strategy. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, will soon publish a Green Paper on energy and Sinn Féin will make submissions to it. We believe in an energy system that is all-Ireland, sustainable and one that serves the needs of the people of Ireland. Energy security is currently a hot topic at a European level and is only likely to become more so. There is no doubt that renewable energy will be play a significant role in guaranteeing Irish energy supply for years to come. However, it must be developed with proper strategy and planning regulations. It must have the consent of host communities and must not intrude on the lives of the people it purports to help. I ask the Government to ensure that any wind farm applications in process are put on hold until the overall vision and strategy is developed and this legislation is enacted. There is little point in enacting good legislation after the damage has been done. Let us remember the banks. I welcome that the Government will not oppose this Bill passing to the next stage. I hope this legislation will form part of the wider debate on energy generation and use in Ireland. My party colleagues and I are willing to work with the Government to ensure that we have a progressive energy strategy and a vision of an Irish energy future that will enjoy the support of and will benefit the vast majority of Irish people. We can all be winners in this.
