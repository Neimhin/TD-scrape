        <heading>Leaders’ Questions</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Taoiseach will attend the informal summit of leaders from across Europe later today, at which it is imperative radical action is taken to restore confidence and growth across Europe.  The situation today is graver than it has been at any time during the past three years.  There is no more room for manoeuvre and delay.  It is essential that Europe takes critical steps on three basic issues, namely, the sovereign debt crisis, which must be tackled by the establishment of a more secure and larger facility for the purchase of Government bonds; the financial crisis, by ensuring that banks are capitalised to a level which ensures their long term survival is unquestioned across Europe, including dealing with Irish bank and mortgage debt; and, the jobs crisis, by utilising the eurozone's enormous resources to deliver immediate job creating investment.  Minimalist approaches are no longer acceptable.  People in Ireland should and must vote "Yes" in the upcoming referendum because this will give us the most secure and cheapest access to the funding we need to retain public services and pay pensions in the years ahead.  Europe is on a precipice and we must do nothing here to push it over the edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">It is in that context that I believe we should take the debate to the people.  Political leaders should be willing to engage in a national debate with those advocating a "Yes" vote and those advocating a "No" vote.  Many voters remain undecided.  Some polls suggest up to 30% of people are undecided.  I believe a leaders' debate should be facilitated.  We live in a democracy.  I understand that invitations for such a debate have issued from RTE, the public service broadcaster which has a particular responsibility in this regard.  TV3 attempted to organise a leaders' debate but leaders, with the exception of Deputy Joe Higgins and I, declined to participate.  People expect leaders to engage.  Will the Taoiseach confirm if, as indicated by a spokesperson yesterday, he has been invited by RTE to participate in a debate and what are his intentions in that regard?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_7">I thank Deputy Martin for his public support, and that of his party, for a "Yes" vote on the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty.  It is important there is no equivocation about this.  It is of particular and fundamental concern for the future of our people and country.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">This evening's informal meeting of European leaders is, I am glad to say, the realisation of the claims by quite a number of leaders for some time that Europe should focus on growth investment and job opportunities.  It is important to note that this is a meeting of 27 leaders rather than of 25 leaders because growth affects all European Union countries.  The opportunity and potential exists for the European Union to be the engine of trade in a global sense, to reduce the cost of business and to complete the Single Market.  It also has potential in the digital area and to deal with the crisis issues in the eurozone in the context of the discussions on project bonds, eurobonds and other facilities to relieve pressure on sovereign Governments and to look at the broader spectrum of EU-US and EU-China trade relations.  I expect leaders of the 27 countries will contribute to this evening's meeting on the growth agenda for the future.  I am happy to participate in that debate from a national and European perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have no difficulty discussing the fiscal stability treaty.  However, I turned down the invitation to appear on a particular programme for good reasons.  RTE has invited me, as Taoiseach, to do a broadcast on Sunday following the Ard-Fheis contribution of the leader of Sinn Fein, Deputy Gerry Adams.  However, I believe that to be predicated on how much time Deputy Adams devotes to the fiscal stability treaty issue on Saturday evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">I accept that today's meeting is extremely important.  However, the debate here is equally important.  I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning that the Taoiseach’s spokesman confirmed last night that the Taoiseach had received a request from RTE to participate in a leaders’ debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">The spokesman said the Taoiseach had received numerous requests.  I asked the Taoiseach if he would confirm that he had received a request from RTE to participate in a debate.  Fianna Fáil has inquired of RTE if there is to be a debate but has received no response in that regard.  It is a fair question.  I am not getting involved in any issue between the Taoiseach and Sinn Féin.  Sinn Féin is holding its Ard-Fheis this weekend----</p>

It is the fairest way to resolve any claims or counter-claims about lack of balance in how particular parties are treated or in terms of the campaign.  More important, we should have the confidence in our position to be able to go on national television and debate the issues.  People do not understand a reluctance to become involved.</p>

Leaving the referendum and the treaty question aside for the moment, we need to look at what is happening in regard to referenda in general.  Referenda are matters for the people to make decisions on; they are not about giving profiles to individual politicians.  Irrespective of the public response in its votes for the different parties, that situation is never reflected in the case of a referendum.

          <p eId="para_154">The last word always rests with the people.  The people own this referendum.  The independent Referendum Commission, chaired by Mr. Justice Feeney, is absolutely above reproach.  It has been entirely objective, truthful and accurate in its comments to every citizen who has asked it a question about this treaty.  The commission has made the point quite clearly that as the law has been passed, this referendum is the people's property.  The people will have the last word.  The chairman of the independent commission pointed out quite clearly on page 9 of the guide to the stability treaty that "the granting of financial assistance in the framework of new programmes under the European Stability Mechanism will be conditional, as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of this Treaty by the Contracting Party ".  Mr. Justice Feeney has confirmed that is the case.  In other words, countries that ratify the treaty will have access to the European Stability Mechanism.  Our contribution to the ESM is €1.2 billion.  We contribute less than 2% of it.  We have a place on the board.  We have a say in how that money will actually be spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">It is clear that the analysis of the Spanish banks which is to be carried out will bring factual evidence of what the situation there is.  The Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Rajoy, has been speaking about this.  The ESM is the permanent bailout facility for the European countries.  As the House is aware, it can be used where required for the payment of salaries and pensions and for the running of a country's services.  I am not suggesting that it will be required.  It is our intention to emerge from the programme as quickly as possible.  In order for us to do that, clearly we have to acquire the confidence of the markets.  We will not acquire the confidence of the markets, which are without sentiment or sympathy, by voting "No".  A "Yes" vote here will guarantee access to the ESM if it is ever required.  It will guarantee a continuation of the line of investment and confidence in this country for job creation.  It will allow us to put our own regulations in place to ensure every future Government, like every Government across the entire eurozone, will have responsible budgeting and will not return to what we had in the past.  I hope Deputy Boyd Barrett can understand what I am saying.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_223">The Bill is required to be enacted before the summer recess for the following reasons.  First, the Limerick regeneration agencies' establishment order contains a sunset clause which will see it cease on 14 June 2012.  It is very important that the Minister has the power to transfer the assets and liabilities and to make provisions for the continuation of contracts before that date.  In that regard, the Limerick regeneration agencies have significant ongoing contracts with building contractors that need to be transferred to Limerick City Council before the bodies cease to have legal effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Second, both the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, HSCA, have been established on an administrative basis for a number of years at this point.  Both new bodies are absolutely crucial to the Department's rationalisation programme as they take over the work that has been carried out separately by six different agencies.  At present, the LGMA and the HSCA cannot employ staff directly, they have to keep multiple accounts and multiple sets of records, which means they are incurring extra costs, and the HSCA has two separate audits.  The lack of legislative footing is severely hampering both agencies' ability to realise the full efficiency gains that were a factor in their establishment.  The CEO of the HSCA has recently written to the Department highlighting the very negative impact the lack of statutory footing is having on the HSCA's operation and on its staff, as the final staffing complement cannot be finalised until such time as the body is established.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The third point is that An Chomhairle Leabharlanna is to be dissolved and a smaller library unit established in the LGMA.  An Chomhairle Leabharlanna has statutory functions that must be transferred to the LGMA and it has sufficient funding to the end of June only.  The dissolution and transfer need to happen before that time.  These are the reasons the Bill must be taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">Yesterday I raised an issue pertaining to promised legislation and the significant variation in the growth rates projected by the Government last April compared to its figures for this year, which project not only lower growth rates but also lower GDP, GNP, job creation and higher unemployment and public debt between 2012 and 2015.  Alarmingly, there has been a significant reduction in the estimate for employment creation between last year and this year.  The Government is predicting that 40,000 fewer net new jobs will be created between 2012 and 2015.  The fiscal responsibility Bill is important and the Taoiseach indicated that the heads of Bills of this nature would be published in advance of the draft legislation to facilitate discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Taoiseach has said from the outset of his time in office that the accuracy and credibility of growth targets and estimates are critical to future policy formulation.  In that context, can he indicate when the fiscal responsibility Bill will be published and whether it is his intention to allow the House access to the draft heads of the Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Has the Taoiseach clarified with the Minister for Defence whether invitations to the event at Custume barracks were issued solely to Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors and that representatives of other partiers were not invited?</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality  (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p eId="para_388">This motion proposes to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into suggestions of collusion by members of the Garda Síochána or other employees of the State in the murder by the Provisional IRA of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan in March 1989.  The tribunal was established in 2005 and is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick, former President of the District Court.  The Oireachtas established the Smithwick tribunal arising from the Weston Park talks in 2001 and in light of Judge Peter Cory's subsequent report in a desire to get at the truth of suggestions of collusion, in the interest of the families bereaved by this atrocity and in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The motion will provide for an extension in the date established for the conclusion of the tribunal's inquiries and the submission of its final report by five months to 31 October 2012.  On 16 November 2011, the Dáil amended the tribunal's terms of reference and established 31 May 2012 as the date by which the tribunal should complete its inquiries and submit its final report to the Clerk of the Dáil.  On that occasion, I made it clear, as I had done previously that if for any reason it did not prove possible for the tribunal to meet the timeframe set out, the chairman could report to the Clerk of the Dáil that circumstances had arisen that required the timeframe to be extended in order that the House could consider the matter.  I also assured the House that the Government's response to such an approach from the chairman would be fully cognisant of, and consistent with, the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.  At the time of the previous extension it was clear the chairman was of the view that the tribunal's work would be complete and the report available by 31 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">On 17 May 2012 the tribunal chairman wrote to the Clerk of the Dáil in order to provide an update on the tribunal's progress and to seek an extension of the deadline for the conclusion of its work.  The Clerk of the Dáil laid the letter before both Houses.  In his letter the tribunal chairman states that since his second interim report was provided to the Oireachtas on 8 March 2012, the tribunal has heard evidence from a further 18 witnesses, some of whom had not been foreseen or scheduled at that time.  The chairman indicates the tribunal has heard evidence from 190 witnesses in total and that he had anticipated concluding the public hearings very shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The chairman also refers to the current indisposition through illness of one witness, whom the chairman considers to be the tribunal's final substantive witness.  In the circumstances, the taking of evidence from that witness has had to be deferred for the time being.  He also notes that he anticipates taking evidence from a small number of further witnesses who have yet to be scheduled.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The Government has considered the tribunal chairman's request and proposes that the Dáil should resolve to extend the timeframe for the tribunal to conclude its work and to present its final report to 31 October 2012.  This is fully in line with the chairman's request.  The Government hopes the tribunal can fulfil its mandate within the revised timeframe set out in this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The Government respects fully the independence of the tribunal chairman to carry out his inquiries without fear or favour and is anxious to support the tribunal in doing that.  I am confident the tribunal will fully discharge its responsibilities and that the motion will assist in that endeavour.  It is important, and of benefit to the House, that the House be informed of progress made.  That was detailed by the tribunal in the letter to the Clerk of the Dáil.  In these circumstances, I commend the Motion to the House.</p>

The report included in his letter seeking an extension is a model for other tribunals and agencies providing progress reports.  Given that the final report will be challenging, I ask the Minister to put some thought into the publication and briefing arrangements for the families and those involved.  Perhaps it is possible to provide a briefing for Members before publication of what will be a challenging report.</p>

The Minister indicated he would grant further time if necessary and I note the Minister suggests October as the completion date.  It is a reasonable timeframe.  According to the judge's letter, he has only one remaining substantial witness and a number of minor witnesses after which he will finalise his report.  There are health reasons for the delay with the substantive witness.  I hope he will complete his work by October.  Like Deputy Calleary, I hope arrangements will be made for publication because it will be a delicate and sensitive matter when the final report is published.  The families must be handled sensitively.  Perhaps Members can receive a copy or a briefing before the report is published.  I wish the tribunal well and hope it can conclude before October.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">I am sorry for interrupting the previous speaker.  I thank all three Deputies for their support of the motion.  It is in the interests of the families and in the public interest that the tribunal completes its comprehensive work.  I hope it can meet the deadline of 31 October.  Previous deadlines were furnished to the House and, unfortunately, for a number of reasons the tribunal was not able to meet them.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I thank Deputies for their suggestions about the publication of the report.  The bereaved families are represented before the tribunal and will have sight of the report before others.  That is a matter for the tribunal and I expect it is the normal process.  The tribunal is independent and has charge of publishing its report.  All Members will receive the report at the same time as it will be a report made to this House by the tribunal.  In the context of the request that Deputies be briefed, Members of the House will be in the same position as members of Government or the Minister in regard to the timeframe.  As I understand, the report will go to the Clerk of the Dáil and become available to us then.  I will confirm this point for Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">It is a report of great significance and importance as well as being a cause of upset and distress, no matter what its conclusions, to the immediate family members affected by the atrocity.  The tribunal will take the necessary care to ensure the bereaved relatives of the former members of the RUC are fully aware of the content of the report and receive a copy in advance.  After Members of the House have had the opportunity to consider its content, there will be statements or a debate in this House.  I thank Members for their assistance and support.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">That is perfect.  The Bill states the recognised universities of the NUI must establish quality assurance procedures and have those procedures approved by the authority.  While the NUI would be covered by the quality standards outlined in the Bill and would be required to meet them, it would remain as a separate awarding body.  The Minister outlined again yesterday, as he did when he published the Bill, that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_647">The amalgamating agencies have performed well over the last decade and have been an important force for change in their respective sectors.  It is now time to bring their related functions together to deliver the best, more cost-effective service.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I welcome that.  In the debate on the Bill in the Seanad the Minister made the following statement, which I also welcome:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_649">Progress can now be most efficiently and effectively achieved through the establishment of a strong single organisation prioritising the needs of learners and delivering quality service to providers.  The amalgamation of agencies is also a key part of the Government's overall public sector reform agenda and the establishment of the authority will result in cost savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The objective of the Bill is to create a single agency, ensuring there are no longer any overlapping responsibilities, consistency in quality and standards and introducing a more cost effective service.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response on the decision to leave the National University of Ireland out of this new framework.  NUI argued that it may lead to reputational damage to the awards on the higher education side and that most member agencies in the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education are concerned solely with higher education.  What about the institutes of technology, which are also in the higher education sector but would be awarded by a separate body, the new authority?</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The Minister must fully clarify this and I look forward to his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Yesterday evening I referred briefly to the international education mark and the code of practice.  The Bill contains new provisions on the regulation of providers offering education and training services to international students whereby the new authority will develop a code of practice.  Providers will be able to apply for the international education mark based on their compliance with the code of practice and it seems while the authority will encourage providers to apply for an international education mark it will not be mandatory.  On Committee Stage we should consider at length whether the code of practice and applying for the international education mark be made mandatory.  According to the regulatory impact assessment for the Bill, which was published last year, providers of international education services would benefit from the international education mark and the code of practice for international learners, which would help contribute to Ireland's reputation as a high-quality education provider.  This is important to encourage more international students to study here which brings with it significant economic benefits.  It is very important that we ensure education service providers are seen to meet the highest international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">In July 2011 the Minister announced the new structure for further education and the establishment of SOLAS, which had been outlined by his predecessor.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil I welcome the proposed new structures.  Several weeks ago at a committee meeting to discuss the Estimates for the Department of Education and Skills I mentioned to the Minister the need to put in place the new structures as soon as possible.  I realise it is a big task and a major opus for the Department and I understand the new structures cannot be put in place overnight, but it is important that they are put in place as soon as possible and that the right structures are used.  I hope the Minister and his officials can progress establishing the new structures as soon as possible.  He will have our support in bringing the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas as speedily as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">During the interregnum period between old and new structures there is always the danger of uncertainty creeping in, and negative messages get more amplified than positive ones.  I caution against this uncertainty, as often doubt can set in the minds of members of staff with regard to their security of tenure, employment, where services will be delivered and the extent of these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The new structure for FÁS is also a welcome development as greater momentum is required with regard to apprenticeships and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The continuing pressure on budgets and staff in higher education impacts on standards and our international reputation.  The Minister must face up to the question of how we maintain standards while continuing to increase participation.  In March 2012 the <i>Times Higher Education</i> world reputation rankings showed Ireland was not represented in the top 100 universities in the world.  No Irish universities ranked among the world elite in a list reflecting the views of more than 17,000 academics throughout the world.  These issues need to be addressed if we are to attract increasing numbers of foreign students.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">As we discussed in other debates on education, including during Question Time, we all welcome the increasing participation level in further and higher education.  The rate of expansion of higher education opportunities in Ireland has consistently been among the highest of all OECD countries in recent decades.  We were fifth highest of all OECD countries in terms of the higher education attainment levels of young adults aged 25 to 34 in 2007.  By 2009 we achieved the highest participation rate in tertiary education in the EU.  This was a very welcome milestone and we must ensure we continue to build on this solid progress.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Paudie Coffey, has a particular interest in the development of technological universities.  There is much interest throughout the country in the institutes of technology and possible clustering.  As the Minister stated clearly, and he is correct, this will depend on very rigorous assessment and the attainment of internationally set educational standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I referred to the world rankings of our universities.  In reply to a question I put to him at the end of April about the recent <i>Times Higher Education</i> world reputation rankings which failed to feature an Irish university being a cause of concern for all of us, the Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_659">Despite some decline, Irish universities continue to figure prominently in world rankings.  Irish institutions are featuring in the top 1% of the world.  In 2011, two Irish institutions were in the top 200 and another three were in the top 400 Times Higher Education World University ranked institutions out of some 15,000 universities worldwide.  Moreover, the overall performance of the Irish system was highly ranked; 17th place overall and 6th place globally relative to our GDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">This message and these statistics are very important and the wider public should know this.  I quoted the Minister's reply because it did not gain traction in the broadcast or print media.  Too often we have negative commentary on the delivery of public services and the inadequacies of our education system.  We should also have traction for information on the quality provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Mr. Boland of the Higher Education Authority, referring to the ranking compiled by Universitas 21, an international network of research universities, stated: "The Universitas 21 approach, in looking at overall systems of higher education, demonstrates in a way which other ranking systems failed to do the great strengths of our higher education and research system.".  It is important that we note this.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I do not know whether it is appropriate to quote our eminent President Michael D. Higgins, but recently he criticised the focus on global rankings.  He stated some universities place more emphasis on the ability of staff to improve their standing than on their teaching ability.  We should bear in mind the comments of President Higgins, a man of great distinction, as a teacher, as an academic, and obviously as our first citizen and a former distinguished Member of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I welcome the legislation and there are some issues we will be able to tease out on Committee Stage.  Fianna Fáil wants this legislation, which has already gone through the Upper House, advanced through this House as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_664">The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill seeks to consolidate services currently provided by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, and the Irish Universities Board, IQUB, under a new agency - the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, QQAAI.  I acknowledge the valuable work done by each of these bodies and the roles they have played in enabling private colleges to gain access to national awards and providing public reassurance regarding the standards in those colleges.  The establishment of the National Framework of Qualifications should bring greater clarity to the complex range of qualifications developed over time across the educational spectrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The Bill sets out to streamline services and put in place a single, more efficient, organisation that ensures quality in further and higher education and training.  An amalgamated body should be better placed to progress plans for development across further and higher education by drawing on the experiences and expertise that currently exists and which can be pooled to offer greater efficiency.  It will also simplify the process of communication for providers, especially those who deal with the range of qualifications and quality assurance bodies.  The new agency will help education and training providers in their dealings with one organisation, and provide greater clarity for learners and award holders.  The coherence of the new system will enhance Ireland's provision of education and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">At present, because several bodies are tasked with providing the types of services covered by the Bill, there has been some overlap and duplication of responsibilities.  Any attempt to improve the delivery of a more efficient service is a laudable aim that can only be achieved if the new authority is properly resourced and staffed with qualified and experienced personnel who are capable of delivering a more effective service.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Sinn Féin supports making qualifications more understandable in different countries across Europe and it is equally important that the Bill provides that education bodies, wherever possible, ensure their awards are recognised within the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ.  It must also enable international comparison between degree programmes and continue to improve the quality of Irish degree courses.  Any new body overseeing quality must strive to create transparency in the Irish education system; ensure independent quality assessment; enable international comparison between degree programmes; and continue to improve the quality of Irish degree courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">For the first time, the Bill provides for the external review of the quality assurance procedures of universities and the transfer of this function from the IUQB to the new agency.  In addition, recognised universities of the NUI are expected to establish quality assurance procedures that must be approved by the new agency.  The authority will also encourage providers to apply for an international education mark, based on their compliance with the code of conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">One of the concerns expressed by the National University of Ireland and echoed by others is that amalgamating a higher education awards body with a further education awards body may lead to reputational damage to the awards on the higher education side.  For example, most member agencies in the European Association for Higher Education Quality Assurance are concerned solely with higher education.  The model of a single agency covering the entire spectrum, from basic literacy awards to doctoral degrees, has not found favour elsewhere, particularly in the countries represented in the European Association for Higher Education Quality Assurance where, by definition, the majority of the member agencies are concerned solely with higher education.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The NUI, while understanding the desire to achieve seamless progression between the two sectors, warns of the possible reputational risk to the qualifications on the higher education side and the implications this would have for higher education colleges.  There are also concerns that the Minister will attempt to pressurise the universities into abolishing their own quality bodies and procedures when the Bill becomes law.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The role and activities of the NUI should not be undervalued, yet the Bill contains a veiled threat to the continuing existence of the organisation.  In what amounts to a warning about the continuance of the National University of Ireland as a federal university, it would tarnish a brand that enjoys high recognition and standing nationally and internationally, and is potentially more damaging to Irish higher education than the proposed change to its awarding role.  The international reputation of NUI degrees at bachelor, master and doctorate level is well established and the existence of the NUI should not be lightly discarded.  It is equally important that quality assurance schemes in established universities that are working well are not undermined by ministerial appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">One of the core objectives of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 was to promote and maintain procedures, and access transfer and progression.  Through education and learning, its central aim was to engender confidence and develop skills for all learners, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Accreditation of prior learning is particularly important for disadvantaged or marginalised socio-economic groups whose prior learning experience must be recognised and considered when they have applied for diploma or degree courses.  The QQAAI must be cognisant of the implications arising from increases in third level fees that restrict access to students from poorer families.  The Government must ensure equality of access to education, starting at preschool level and applied to all aspects of learning at primary and post-primary level through to third level.  This is one of the cornerstones of ensuring we have a progressive and fair education system that works towards positive outcomes across lifelong learning for all of our citizens and I would be interested to hear how the Minister intends to address these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">During the Seanad debate on the Bill, Senator Ó Clochartaigh referred to the Bologna Declaration of 1999 that aims to provide a common European system of credits and create a system that makes it easier to compare degrees.  There is merit in developing this type of cross-European co-operation and standardisation, but it should be remembered that the Bologna Declaration has received its fair share of criticism.  Instead of making European higher education more compatible, comparable and attractive for students, it has been seen by some to facilitate the commercialisation of higher education and, in the process, engendered the type of competitiveness that hampers the development of a broader, holistic approach to learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">There are also strongly held views that there has been a change in the emphasis of universities from centres of knowledge and learning into institutions that churn out qualifications.  In the process, students are being treated as customers on a conveyor belt system, which is over-regulated and fails to allow for national differences or individual considerations.  The emphasis on the attainment of vocational degrees has resulted in a reduction in funding for some non-vocational areas and this has led to sponsorship by big business of the more "employable" education programmes.  Many institutions offer a broad education and it is important that this approach is preserved, as there is more to education than the mere grinding out of results for the lowest costs possible and for the international league tables, which can be rather misleading.  We should be cautious in how we implement reform and a central aim must be the preservation of the positive, unique aspects of our higher and further education systems, while striving to make improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The RIA claims that the Bill will incur no additional cost to the Exchequer and will eventually result in savings of €1 million annually.  This reduction in costs should be realised over time and will be achieved through economies of scale and reductions in staff numbers and CEOs.  The Minister should clarify if there will be job losses resulting from the establishment of the QQAAI and what the cost to the Exchequer of terminating senior management and CEO contracts will be.  Even more importantly, savings made through the amalgamation of the existing exam bodies should be redirected into essential front line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The RIA also warns of possible costs that might be incurred by universities in implementing revised quality assurance practices.  I hope the Minister will give assurances that any additional costs will not result in a rise in student fees.  I also hope the Bill will be able to establish quality assurance procedures that will help address the recent slippage of Irish universities in world rankings, which saw Trinity College Dublin drop 13 places, UCD drop 20 places and NUI Galway drop 66 places.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The Bill provides that only the Minister can appoint the eight members of the QQAAI board, but consideration might be given to allowing interested parties, individually or in appropriate groups, to make at least some nominations.  By expanding the board's membership it would be possible to include people with wider business, management, community and learner perspectives, as well as international expertise.  It is also important that there is student representation on the board.  The current proposals appear to provide little space for an Irish academic voice or for any significant university input.  Any new agency should have a meaningful relationship with the universities with regard to external quality assurance, and it would seem essential for it to include some relevant expertise at board level.  The appointed CEO will wield a good deal of power under the legislation and it is important that there is clarification about to whom he or she will be accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">The new authority aims to encourage providers to apply for an international education mark based on their code of conduct.  Nowhere in the Bill is it mentioned that course providers must guarantee that courses will run to their final completion.  Last summer, there was understandable uproar when some well-known language schools in Dublin closed after having accepted fees from students.  Providers should have to show they are financially viable before getting this mark and this should be applicable to all higher education providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">One of the most worrying aspects of the Bill concerns section 21(2), which implies that conditions of staff will not be protected except for remuneration.  Furthermore, subsection (3) does not include conditions relating to superannuation, so pensions of existing members might be threatened when transferred to the new body.  There are well founded fears that conditions of service, pension rights and salary pay scales are not covered by the Bill and that this may have implications for staff being redeployed across the public sector.  The Minister should consider amending the Bill and use the wording contained in section 52(8) and (9) of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 that legislates to protect the transfer conditions of staff so their existing entitlements in respect of tenure, remuneration, fees allowances, expenses and superannuation remain in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The NQAI, FETAC, HETAC and IUQB welcome the publication of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training ) Bill 2011.  The legislation provides for a new single national agency, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, QQAAI, to replace FETAC, HETAC, NQAI and IUQB.  It is anticipated that the QQAAI will be established in 2012.  This legislation will amalgamate the existing national qualifications and quality assurance bodies for learners into one new agency.  The agency will be responsible for a wide range of functions and should hopefully provide a more integrated, efficient and coherent range of services to learners across the further and higher education and training sectors that will meet the highest international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">It is important that the new agency does more than just consolidate the existing functions of the NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and the IQUB.  It will be tasked with building on Ireland's reputation for quality in education and training and will be well placed to highlight and promote best practice throughout the Irish educational and training system.  It must serve learners and the public and build on the past achievements of the existing individual agencies, under the National Framework of Qualifications.  One of its key aims must be to provide greater opportunities for learners and support and promote a culture of quality in Irish higher education by independently evaluating the effectiveness of Irish universities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_684">The establishment of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland is a progressive step.  It will combine the existing National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, into a single cohesive body.  This should ensure that we are competitive in terms of the standard of education for international studies with the development of an international education mark and code of practice for international education.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">A strong university system is a vital component for Ireland's future both in terms of universal standards being met and enabling our students to access the best institutional management toolkits, equivalent to those operating in European and American universities.  In an economically competitive world it is obvious that in the 21st century countries will only be as strong as their universities and knowledge will determine the well being and success of nations.  Success in this knowledge-intensive world is predicated on this being delivered by institutions performing to globally competitive standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">In Ireland, the education system has been criticised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  Ireland has prided itself in the last two decades on its high standards but the latest OECD findings appear to point to the contrary.  In 2000, the OECD survey of 15 year olds ranked Ireland in an impressive fifth place in literacy, well above the OECD average.  However, the past decade has seen an influx of immigrants into Ireland which means that over 8% of the school going population in 2009 comprised non-nationals.  This made a significant difference and, as a result, Ireland has dropped dramatically from fifth place to 17th in literacy levels.  This is the most dramatic drop by any OECD country.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The new chief inspector in the Department of Education and Skills, Dr. Harold Hislop, recently published a report on school inspections in primary schools.  The results were shocking.  Inadequacies in almost 15% of English and mathematics classes were discovered when the inspectors arrived unannounced at the schools.  Almost 500 schools were visited in the past year.  The key findings of the report are: that one in six students in Ireland have poor reading skills; overall, 17% of students are lower achievers in reading; ironically, girls secondary schools continue to demonstrate higher reading scores; the first generation of migrant children had very low levels of achievement in reading.  This report demonstrates that at primary level education we must re-educate and upskill our teachers.  Following an intensive investigation of our second and third level educators, emphasis should be focused on raising their standards, particularly in science and mathematics subjects.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Foreign investors and potential foreign investors in the past four or five years have indicated that they are very dissatisfied with the standards and quality of students in mathematics and science subjects on leaving our universities and colleges.  The Minister is striving to address this matter and is also making an effort to put a better system in place in our training colleges to address this at primary level as well.  I very much welcome his endeavours in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">It is alarming that Irish universities fell in the university rankings for 2010, as Deputy McLellan mentioned.  While these institutions have enjoyed high prestige worldwide and have attracted thousands of students down through the years, their ranking is plummeting at present.  For instance, Trinity College has fallen from 76th to 117th position, while UCD has fallen from 94th to 159th position in the rankings.  Hopefully, this position will be reversed and this Bill in particular will create an environment in which Irish universities will return to their former rankings.  One positive aspect is that UCC, NUI Galway and other universities are included in the listings of the top 500 universities worldwide, which is highly encouraging.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">As for the Bill, Members must ensure the overarching authority ensures that Irish education awards are recognised internationally.  In addition, the aforementioned authority should create a sector or body that promotes Irish universities, colleges and institutes of higher education internationally.  In addition, the availability of the English language should be used to encourage international students to study in Ireland.  I note the United Kingdom has a long history of welcoming overseas students to its universities and colleges.  Last year, there were 1.8 million full-time undergraduate students in higher education in the United Kingdom, which included 104,000 international students.  Moreover, the United Kingdom makes use of the British Council, which can be found in practically every country in the world, and which operates from its embassies and other representative agencies.  Some institutions went further, even to the point of opening up offices to recruit international students into the United Kingdom.  I suggest the new authority here should, through the network of Irish embassies and consulates located throughout the world, fellow develop well thought-out ideas to sell Irish higher education to international students.  Apparently, the average income to be derived from such students is approximately €6,000 each, depending on the particular field of study on which they embark in Ireland.  Incidentally, there has been a huge influx of students into the United Kingdom's universities from various countries, including, significantly, Asian countries.  It attracts 67,000 from China, 39,000 from India, 17,000 from Nigeria, 16,000 from the United States of America, 13,000 from Malaysia and 10,000 each from Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and Ireland should tap into this market in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">In addition, the authority should develop the quality of science and mathematics courses to the highest standard by providing funding for research and by encouraging students to take up such courses.  This in turn will encourage investors to create jobs based on science and technology in Ireland.  The availability of a good number of science and maths students of a high standard can only be positive for the State's economy in the future.  Finally, I note the Minister's recent announcement of the new Erasmus programme within the European Union.  I congratulate him on his achievement in securing significant increases for this programme, as up to €19 million will be available over its timeframe.  It also coincides with Ireland's Presidency of the European Union and we certainly should greatly benefit from this transfer and interaction of students between the Continent and Ireland.  Ireland should grasp and make the most of this opportunity, as it should be highly beneficial for the Irish education system and students.  It constitutes another step in the direction in which Ireland should progress.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I will make a couple of brief points.  The idea of establishing a single organisation, rather than several, to deal with standards in further and higher education and training obviously is eminently sensible.  While people may raise some objections as to how it is done, the principle of it being done is appropriate, should be examined and should be proceeded with.  As other Members have noted, the issues of standards in education is critical and in an Irish context, they have been falling in recent years.  While I do not suggest Deputy Tom Fleming made this point, I do not accept any implication that in dragging down our standards, this is the fault of immigrant children.  I consider the falling standards to have much more to do with the education cutbacks that were carried out by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party obviously but continued by the present Administration, as well as the failure of the Government to ensure an adequate investment in education that is appropriate to the growing population.  In this context, one cannot consider the issue in isolation because funding for education is critical.  Members have had many debates previously on how even economically, it makes far more sense and is far more cost efficient to invest in children from an early age and to reap the benefits of so doing in later life.  In this context, the continuation of cutbacks in SNA provision, the damage done in rural schools, the attempts on the DEIS schools, the increasing class sizes and so on will be, and already have been, extremely detrimental to the individual development of children and to the well-being of society as a whole.  Members must consider this point both from the perspective of individuals and by recognising what in my opinion is a crime, namely, one would fund people's education and not have jobs for them at the end of it.  All this knowledge and all this expertise that has been developed here at home is being exported because gainful employment is not available for people at the end of their education.  Consequently, a holistic approach is required when addressing these issues and in this context, it is linked to the fiscal treaty because were the targets being set to be enforced on the economy, it undoubtedly and inevitably would lead to further cutbacks and education undoubtedly would be to the forefront in this regard, as it already has been.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">In respect of the proposed amalgamations, this Bill follows on from amalgamations that took place previously on foot of the 1999 Act, with the amalgamation of the National Council for Educational Awards and the National Council for Vocational Awards, as well as the establishment of FETAC, HETAC and all the other organisations this legislation now proposes to amalgamate.  In this context, I wish to address the issue of the protection of employees in that transfer.  I consider this to be the weakest part of the Bill and the provision to which Members must pay attention.  This should not be a difficulty and I am somewhat surprised as to the reason it has been left out or the reason for the provision's wording, which has caused great concern for staff in that area.  Although it was possible in previous legislation to enshrine the rights and entitlements for all the terms and conditions of the staff in those bodies, this Bill is leaving the position much more open.  Deputy McLellan made the point in respect of section 21(2) but it should be spelled out because it pertains to people who are employed in these organisations and who will be transferred over to the new authority.  It is quite explicit and states "Save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with a recognised trade union or staff association... a person referred to in <i>subsection (1) </i>[that is, an existing employee] shall not, while in the service of the Authority, be subject to less beneficial conditions in relation to remuneration than the conditions in relation to remuneration” to which he or she already was subject.  This refers solely to remuneration and the fact that section 21(3) then goes on to specifically exclude superannuation makes the original clause even worse and makes people feel more vulnerable.  Section 21(2) spells out there will be no protection provided except in the area of remuneration, while section 21(3) specifically excludes superannuation.  Members must consider this provision in the context of the changes to public sector pensions that have taken place recently and the fear among people to which it gives rise, because unless this legislation is amended, as it stands the pensions of existing staff members could be undermined seriously in the transfer.  Could they be exposed to a situation whereby they would be treated akin to new entrants?  It is clear, based on the Act as currently drafted, that this could happen, putting those people in an incredibly vulnerable position.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Section 52(8) of the 1999 Act covers other areas of employment and states that the rights and entitlements, in terms not only of remuneration but tenure, fees, allowances, expenses and superannuation, enjoyed on the commencement of the Act by a person shall not, by virtue of the Act, be any less beneficial than are the rights and entitlements enjoyed by a person immediately prior to its commencement.  The following subsection lists the organisations which are being amalgamated in this Bill in the context of spelling out whose terms and conditions are being protected.  That Act states that the rights of staff currently employed in these bodies, of whom there are approximately 30 or 40, should not be exposed further.  I hope this is an issue which the Minister intends to address otherwise the people concerned and the Technical Group would not be happy to support this legislation, in particular in the context of the radical changes that have taken place in regard to the terms and conditions of public sector employees.  We do not want current employees to be placed any less favourably than their peers.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">There has been much talk of this amalgamation resulting in savings of €1 million per annum.  It is stated in the relevant documentation that these savings will be made over time.  However, there is a need for clarity around what jobs will be affected.  Will it be CEO posts in respect of which administrative functions will be eroded and so on?  I have no problem with the amalgamation of the bodies concerned.  There are greater problems in our education system than those being addressed by this amalgamation.  The further progression of this Bill is dependant on protection of the terms and conditions of all existing employee arrangements in the transfer to the new body.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_696">Go raibh maith agat.  I too welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011.  While I welcome the proposed amalgamation, we must ensure we protect what we have.  We must not be afraid to amalgamate but must be careful how we move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">On 27 July 2011, the chief executive designate of the QQAI, Dr. Padraig Walsh, in a statement welcoming the publication of the Bill stated that this legislation will provide a more integrated, efficient and coherent range of services to learners across the further and higher education and training sectors to the highest international standards, which is a noble and worthy declaration in terms of where we want to go and should and must be.  FETAC, HETAC, NQAI and IUQB are all agreed that this move strengthens a focus on high quality learning experiences across all educational and training provisions nationally.  The strength of existing quality assurance systems will grow, opening up new opportunities for people to engage and succeed in learning.  That should be our mission statement.  It is what we want to achieve.  We need to open up new opportunities, in particular educational opportunities which lead to employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">While the NUI agrees that a single agency may lead to efficiencies over time it believes there is a risk in amalgamating a higher education awards body with further education awarding bodies.  It believes this may lead to reputational damage to the awards in the higher education arena.  It is important we keep a watchful eye on this to ensure no such damage occurs.  The NUI argues that most member agencies in the European Association for Higher Education and Quality Assurance are concerned solely with higher education.  We must acknowledge the NUI's concerns.  Higher education awards are internationally recognised and we must ensure they are not damaged in any shape or form.  However, this declaration may not be the be all and end all: we should perhaps examine this further.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">There is a need for a change of emphasis in our universities.  Previous speakers on the Opposition side referred to the conveyor belt system, namely, taking in as many students as possible, training them up and getting them out, which is a cause for concern.  This type of system has diminished the role of our universities.  Members will be aware that our universities have slipped in the rankings in previous years.  While we must protect the uniqueness of our universities we must be cognisant of the message we are getting - which we did not get today or yesterday - from international direct investment companies in Ireland.  Four years ago I and up to 80 other politicians attended a talk given by an man from an important high technology company in Galway at which we were told that we needed to act fast to reverse the trend in the area of science and physics.  While previously our students of science and physics had been highly regarded and respected they were no longer achieving high standards in this area.  The man concerned had and continues to have linkages with Galway university.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">On the invitation of the American ambassador, I and a number of my colleagues, visited his residence some months ago and took place in a round table discussion with senior business people who told us they are hugely concerned about the standard of achievement in mathematics, physics and science.  They told us that despite all the work being done by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation to attract foreign companies here and the huge costs involved in this regard they are bringing their own graduates in physics and science with them to fill specific positions, which is a damning indictment of our university system.  These companies are availing of our low corporation tax and so on but they are not employing Irish people.  The problem is not that they do not want to employ Irish people but that we do not have suitably qualified people for the job.  We must be cognisant of this and deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">I am concerned about the slippage of our universities in this regard.  Have the Department of Education and Skills, the CEOs in our universities and the senior people in charge taken their eye off the ball?  Are they simply trying to educate the multitude - I accept everyone has an equal right to education - or have they become lethargic and lazy?  It is one thing to be told by the OECD that our universities have slipped in the international rankings but it is another to  be told this by international investors.  I note my colleague, Deputy Tom Hayes, is in the House.  We have also been told this by companies in south Tipperary, although not that bluntly.  This problem needs to be addressed.  We all know that it is necessary for companies to bring particular people with them but that they are having to bring in their own employees because we do not have suitably qualified people is madness.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I am concerned about the number of people the Minister proposes to appoint to the new board as this leaves no room for outside expertise.  The Minister proposes to appoint eight members.  Surely the bodies being amalgamated should be given some recognition.  I do not know from where the appointees will be drawn but I am sure they will be of sufficient expertise.  However, the Minister should allow for the appointment of 12 members so as to provide for outside representation, perhaps from companies investing and wishing to invest here.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">They have many stark messages and experiences from their own countries of the kind of people who are being educated there rather than here.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">For private companies operating in this area there should be something such as a bond.  It is unbelievable that one can pay fees to private companies which then close down.  It is tough enough at present for families to survive and anybody who trades in that way should be solvent, should not trade recklessly or take in fees for a season and close shortly afterwards.  There must be a bond or some other way in which people can get back their money.  It is not only about money but about the trauma and distress caused to students and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Overall, we must ensure that our education system and our universities are fit for purpose.  We must get back into that league table because that is where we should be.  We must be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with any of our partners in Europe and attract international students, for a number of reasons.  Obviously, it is a big boost to the economy to have a student come to this country.  It is ludicrous that seven students from different countries have not been allowed to come to this country.  The only way they can do so is through Northern Ireland, which is ridiculous.  We have the capacity and we should have the proper tool which would attract students.  We had it before and must go back to it and ensure that students come to this country.  We must have courses that are internationally recognised for students when they return to their own countries.  They will be able to talk about the wonderful education they received, the wonderful system they experienced and the nice place they were in, Ireland of the thousand welcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Most important, however, is the standard of education.  We have to be able to convince the OECD we are fighting back.  Some 8% of school goers are in trouble and this starts in primary school.  We can blame the big classes and many other elements but there are many inadequacies in the system.  Everybody must be protected but I do not want to see colleagues refer to the different levels of posts. I do not want to see a big row about people maintaining their positions, the chief executive officers and the deputy CEOs.  We have had too much of that in this country.  There has been too much enhancement of CEOs and senior people who create little dynasties for themselves.  We must think what we are about, namely, educating our people and being internationally recognised, not having little empires and kingdoms built.  People want different grades and then want to have the same grade when they go elsewhere.  We have too much of that and it has gone on for far too long.  It has left us nowhere and only brings bitterness, with people not pulling together or working together as they should and for the sake of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">I wish the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, well in his endeavours.  It is time this was dealt with properly.  I do not say we must not recognise people's rights and levels because we must do so but heads must be banged together.  We need to have a system that is fit for purpose and for what it is designed to do, that does what it says on the tin and is internationally recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">We need to move on this and I wish the Minister for Education and Skills well.  He needs to do a root and branch review of education standards in all schools.  I may be straying a little from the mark but I refer to the attack on DEIS schools, especially small rural schools.  The best people, the best business people, and the best internationally recognised people have come from small local schools.  Everybody in the Chamber knows that as well as I do.  It is not because they are in the metropolis or a big town that everything is good.  The best products and the most driven achievers have come from small schools.  The present attack on these schools must be withdrawn.  It is not right, fair or proper.  It is the weakest section because it does not have the clout but it must be protected.  Those schools have served the country well for generations and decades and will serve it well for generations and decades to come.  They allow weaker 11 year olds or people with lesser abilities to compete fairly and go on to second and third level and achieve, or to go into business after second level, or whatever.  They cannot be mushroomed and attacked as is happening to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">I welcome this legislation which will amalgamate the existing national qualifications and quality assurance bodies for students into one new agency.  The Irish education system has served us well in the past, helping to recalibrate Ireland's international reputation and promote the country's talent, something of which we are very proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The functions of the new agency will be to consolidate the existing functions of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, and the Irish Universities Qualities Board, IUQB.  The four bodies are agreed that this move strengthens a focus on high-quality learning experiences across all education and training provision nationally.  The strength of current quality assurance systems will grow, opening up new opportunities for people to engage and succeed in learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">We will soon have a new acronym, QQAI, standing for the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, which will be responsible for a wide range of functions, providing a more integrated, efficient and coherent range of services to students across the further and higher education and training sectors, to the highest international standards.  The new authority will bring with it the power to decide the standards of learning which must be met by the student before an award is given.  In addition, the authority will have the power to review programmes it has already validated and to withdraw that validation if it deems there are reasonable grounds for so doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Such quality assurance provisions will mean that the QQAI will be responsible for building on Ireland's reputation for quality in education and training and it will be strongly positioned to highlight and promote best practice throughout the educational and training systems.  The national framework of qualifications, NFQ, will be further developed by QQAI which will, in time, lead to greater opportunities for students.  The currency of all awards on the framework remains guaranteed, building on the many achievements of the individual agencies and untied by the framework of qualifications.  The amalgamation will support and promote a culture of quality in Irish higher education.  It will independently evaluate the effectiveness of quality processes in Irish universities to deliver a better and more cost effective service.  It has been estimated by the Department that the amalgamation will save the Exchequer in the region of €1 million per annum, which must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">A significant element of this Bill is that it provides for a code of practice for the provision of educational services to international students.  Based on their compliance with this code of practice, education and training providers will be able to apply for an international education mark-based system.  One concern that might have existed about the proposed legislative framework was that by mixing the quality assurance process of the university sector with the quality and standards of other educational bodies, the autonomy of the university system and its particular ethos and mission might be compromised.  However, there is special provision throughout for what are described as "previously established universities".  These universities will continue to operate their own quality assurance processes subject, however, to obligations of consultation with the new authority and for providing it with information, as highlighted in section 28 of the Bill.  The provisions of the Bill ensure that the needs of students will be prioritised, including those who have chosen to travel from abroad to study in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Of course, it will be important to ascertain how the QQAI will work in practice.  A very promising aspect is that its new chief executive will be Dr. Padraig Walsh, formerly of DCU and most recently the chief executive of the IUQB.  His influence on the culture of this new body will ensure that it operates in a way that respects university autonomy and encourages a positive approach to quality assurance and enhancement.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">As we continue on the road to economic recovery it is important for us to continue to promote the right skills needed for the 21st-century knowledge economy.  We must be mindful that the system which brought us the graduates of the past and today will itself be brought up to a world class standard so that we are ready to meet the challenges of the future.  This Bill is just another step forward in that process.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_277">
          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_717">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this Bill which concerns the establishment of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland.  The new authority will assume the responsibilities of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the Further and Training Awards Council, all of which will be dissolved under this Bill.  In other words, this is one of the first times this Government has taken real action to eliminate quangos.  A year, two years or three years ago, people read about the cost of quangos and the duplication of their work in various areas.  The introduction of this legislation is a solid performance as part of the effort to tackle that programme.  Most importantly, the members of the new authority to be appointed in line with this Bill under the direction of the Minister will not be paid any allowance or remuneration other than travel and subsistence expenses.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on ensuring that will be the case.  It is a good sign that the Government is facing up to doing what it said it wanted to do before last year's general election.  This legislation will give the Minister an opportunity to appoint top-class people to the new authority, which is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I commend this Bill.  When I saw that it had been published, I decided I would speak on it in this House and express my full support for it.  The amalgamation of these bodies is a key part of the Government's overall public sector reform agenda.  It will result in significant cost savings to the State.  It is important to acknowledge that in recent years, the three existing bodies have been extremely successful in reducing their costs.  I note that their current allocation in 2011 amounted to almost €9 million, which represented a saving of approximately 30% on the 2008 allocation under a different regime.  Further savings of approximately €1 million will be achieved through rationalisation, corporate structures and support through integrated services.  This is what we are all about.  The shortage of money is one of the real issues facing this country.  The need to manage the public service in a different way is the biggest issue facing the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and every other Department.  A certain amount of money is available to run the public service.  In my opinion, this is one of the best possible ways of getting value for that money.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Cost savings should not be our only goal, however, particularly in an area like education.  This amalgamation will result in a more efficient system of qualification and quality assurance in further and higher education and training.  Ireland badly needs to enhance its reputation in this field, particularly given its low ranking in many international university tables.  This amalgamation will bring about a more coherent approach to higher education and training in the future.  Ireland, like other EU member states, has adopted a lifelong learning approach to education and training.  A key feature of this comprehensive approach is the seamless transfer and progression of all learners with accreditation through the National Framework of Qualifications.  The amalgamation of the two VECs in County Tipperary will affect my own constituency of Tipperary South.  I was amazed by the reaction of people to that announcement.  Nobody other than politicians and people on the boards approached me to question the decision.  I believe the amalgamation of the VECs, like the amalgamation of the county councils, will prove worthwhile and will lead to many cost savings.  As long as good leadership is shown in the council and in the VEC, the amalgamations will lead to increased efficiencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">I cannot allow Deputy Mattie McGrath's comment about the "attack" on rural schools to go answered.  Despite all the talk, no schools in the constituency both of us represent have had to close.  Clogheen national school and Newtown Upper national school, which is near Carrick-on-Suir, were given a reprieve.  When they appealed the decisions that had been made, they did not lose any teachers.  This issue relates to just one school in south Tipperary - Burncourt national school - and is being worked on.  I believe it is nonsense that people are frightening others by suggesting that schools in rural Ireland will have to close under this Government.  Nobody ever proposed that any schools would have to close.  There may be a place for amalgamations and board of management changes, and what is wrong with that?  We should be considering such measures.  If anybody else suggests this Government is attacking rural schools, he or she should be taken to task.</p>

        <speech by="#RobertDowds" eId="spk_278">
          <from>Deputy Robert Dowds</from>
          <p eId="para_721">I strongly welcome this Bill for a number of reasons.  It makes absolute sense that the services being provided by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, the Further and Training Awards Council, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the Irish Universities Quality Board are to be combined and streamlined.  The two previous speakers have mentioned that this measure will save money and help to remove a little of the excessive bureaucracy that exists in this country.  That aspect of this legislation must be welcomed.  It makes eminent sense that we should have a National Framework of Qualifications, particularly one that is internationally recognised.  The more we move towards bringing qualifications in Ireland on a par with qualifications in other European countries like France, Britain or Germany, the better.  Given that the people of this country are primarily English-speaking - ach amháin sna háiteanna ina chónaíonn daoine mar an Aire Stáit atá i láthair - Ireland is in a particularly strong position to benefit from this development.  We can build on the advantage we have by further developing our standing in the area of the teaching of English.  By moving towards internationally recognisable qualifications, we will help to encourage more foreign students to come here to learn English.  Given that English is in such demand as an international language, I hope our efforts in this regard can contribute in some way towards tackling the jobs crisis and putting Ireland more prominently on the map.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">I would like to make an appeal to the Minister.  I have a great deal of indirect experience of seeing people having to operate the FETAC system.  It was an excellent system, in many respects, in the sense that it was independent and it insisted on decent standards.  The operation of the system was extremely difficult for those who were providing courses, however.  Many people submitted course proposals only for them to be returned with pretty unhelpful comments, for example about not enough detail or too much detail being included in them.  I am aware of cases in which people had to submit their proposals on four or five occasions before they were given validation.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure the new system is much friendlier towards users, given that bureaucracy is meant to serve the user and not the other way around.  There has been a serious problem in that respect.  I am aware of a person who took early retirement recently for the sole reason that he could no longer cope with having to get validation from FETAC.  When I was teaching, the bureaucracy was so horrendous that I studiously avoided FETAC on all occasions with one exception.  It was very bad in the early days, when it was insisted that everybody should do everything online even though the system was not working properly.  On one occasion, a situation arose where tutors were brought to a venue in, I believe, Tullamore but the person showing them how to use the system could not get it up and running, which demonstrated to them the problems for the ordinary people trying to operate the system.  While that has improved, at the same time, there has been a huge problem of people having their suggestions returned.  The area in which I have known people to work this best is in regard to literacy.  In some areas, it should be possible to provide the basic core of courses rather than people having to invent the wheel over and over again.  It is important that it be possible to adapt courses according to the needs of individual students.  However, in many areas it should be possible to provide core courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I regret that the Minister for Education and Skills has left the Chamber.  It is very important that bureaucracy works for those whom it is meant to serve rather than just being a hindrance to them.  I appeal strongly that it is ensured that whatever new system emerges works effectively and, if it is seen not to work effectively, that it be tweaked until it does.  In spite of this appeal, I welcome the Bill as a very positive step towards integration of further and higher education which should make lifelong learning easier and should help to enable Ireland to become even more of an international provider of many areas of education, particularly English as a foreign language.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_726">The Bill deals with the formation of the new body, the qualification and quality assurance authority of Ireland.  I broadly welcome the initiative, which seems a useful tidying up and consolidation exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Part of the new authority's remit is to manage the national framework qualifications.  This is important work domestically and internationally in terms of our educational system.  The second remit of the authority, on which I would like to focus, is to oversee the quality assurance procedures of our universities, and how it oversees, implements, watches and approves those procedures will be very important.  I would also like to focus on what else will have to happen as well as those quality assurance procedures in order to reverse the crisis in which our universities find themselves.  It is fair to say the universities in Ireland today are in a very serious crisis. <i>The Times</i> higher education rankings for this year show that both UCD and Trinity College, Dublin fell out of the top 100 in the world, UCC and NUI Galway fell out of the top 300 and DCU and DIT fell out of the top 400.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I was speaking about the quality of graduates with the head of human resources for a US multinational which has multiple sites around the country.  He told me that, ten years ago, Irish graduates around Europe and the US were seen as premium graduates who were actively sought after.  However, he said that, year on year over the past decade, the Government, the universities and the Department of Education and Skills have essentially been failing our graduates because the quality of those graduates has been getting lower and lower, at least as it has been perceived by the people who have had to hire them in those ten years.  He said that Irish graduates are in no way seen as premium graduates around Europe or in the US or other parts of the world; instead, they are viewed as absolutely average.  This is a huge problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">He further said that the quality of graduates he needs is becoming so low that "they are becoming unemployable" for what his multinational needs.  That is very serious.  We can debate whether it is true but that does not really matter.  For the graduates, what matters is that the employers are saying that and are telling Members of Dáil Éireann this is how serious the crisis is.  He said that at master's and PhD level they do not even try to hire in Ireland any longer.  There are positions in Ireland but, to fill them, they do not even advertise in Ireland any longer and only go abroad.  He said that the quality of our postgraduates - our master's and PhD students - has become so low compared to Europe and the US that they simply do not bother hiring here any longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">We have to become very aware of the scale of the crisis we are facing and of the role this new authority can, I hope, play.  Why is this happening?  It is happening partly because the leaving certificate students the universities are getting are also falling in quality.  The PISA report some 18 months ago showed that our secondary schools have had the greatest fall in educational standards in the developed world both in relative and absolute terms.  It is not just that others are getting better quicker than we are.  In a decade when we doubled the <i>per capita</i> investment in education, we had the single biggest fall in educational standards in the developed world.  The universities are getting secondary school graduates who simply are not as well educated as they were five or ten years ago, and this is a big problem for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The second problem is what is going on in the universities themselves.  There are three issues on which I would like to focus, the first of which is money.  World class education costs money.  Budget 2012 has a 6% cumulative drop in funding to universities between this year and 2015.  If we factor in 2% inflation per year in each of those years, that is an extra 8%, so we get to a real cut in funding for our universities in the next four years of 14%.  It gets much worse.  At the same time, student numbers in the universities are projected to increase by 18%, so they are being asked to educate a lot more students with a lot less money.  The per student funding will drop between now and 2015 by just under 30%.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Things are getting bad very quickly.  If we are to take an extra 30% per student away from our universities, they will continue to get much, much worse.  This is extraordinarily serious.  Of course, this means class sizes increase, research posts disappear and teaching supports evaporate.  What happens?  Our universities do less and less well, international academic staff and international students are not interested in coming here any longer, we do not get the prestige, expertise and money from international students, the money dries up further and it becomes a vicious circle.  We are in a very serious situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">The second reason I put to the Minister is that the Government is refusing to set a bold, ambitious target for our universities.  I raised the issue of falling standards with the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, in October.  He came back with a bunch of statistics which suggested that if we think about it another way, we are doing just fine.  That is very worrying.  He would not accept the scale of the crisis whatsoever.  When I asked what ideas the Government was possibly taking from the likes of Oxford, Cambridge and the Ivy League universities in the US, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, said he considered those universities to be "incredibly elitist".  Therefore, not only are we not aspiring to have some of the best universities in the world, in Dáil Éireann one of the Ministers of State with responsibility for education is actively turning up his nose at the best universities in the world.  Again, this is deeply worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The third reason is that the universities here are not implementing management practices which we know some of the best universities in the world use at student level, graduate level and at the level of academic and professional staff.  I believe this is because both academic and non-academic management within the universities have huge constraints in terms of what they are actually allowed do.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">What can be done?  I would like to address those three reasons.  As the Minister knows, the Hunt report recommended an extra-----</p>

            <p eId="para_737">1<b>Deputy Michael McGrath</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> the likely cost of funds that would apply, in the event that the Fiscal Stability Treaty referendum is passed on 31 May, if Ireland should need to avail of funding from the European Stability Mechanism beyond the period of the current EU-IMF programme of assistance; the way this compares to current market rates for Irish Government bonds; if he will confirm the other sources of funding that would be available for the country in the event that the referendum is rejected and access to the ESM is blocked; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Finance  (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_738">It is not clear what other source of funding would be available if the stability treaty is rejected, with the resulting loss of access to the ESM.  However, what is clear is that any funding that would be available would cost considerably more than any prospective ESM funds.  The IMF has indicated that it will provide funding to Ireland only as part of a European initiative.  I have consulted with the NTMA and it considers that a "No" vote in the referendum on the stability treaty would mean in all likelihood that it would not be possible for Ireland to re-enter the bond markets at sustainable rates.  Ireland's programme of financial support runs to the end of 2013.  It remains on track.  Based on current projections and assuming no market access, the State has access to sufficient funds for its needs well into the second half of 2013.  The continuation of the strong programme implementation will ensure that we emerge successfully from this programme.  It is the NTMA's stated intention to return to sovereign debt markets as soon as market conditions permit.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The availability of ESM funding is an important part of facilitating our return to the markets as it provides reassurance to the financial markets.  The ESM treaty sets out the arrangements for loan pricing.  In summary, it will be the financing and operating cost plus an appropriate margin.  It is not appropriate to speculate on the interest rate that would apply in the event that funding were to be sought from the ESM.  However, the average cost of our current EU-IMF funding is 3.46%.  This is well below the current market rates for Irish bonds – where the ten year rate has been around 7% in recent months.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">The capital structure of the ESM was designed to ensure that it would receive the highest possible rating, thus ensuring the lowest possible cost of funding.  The principle that the EU funding mechanisms should not generate a profit is now well established following the reductions to the EFSF and EFSM rates agreed in 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_741">I thank the Minister for his response.  In the remaining week of the referendum campaign, the debate will come down to brass tacks.  We know for sure that in the second half of next year Ireland will need to have identified with certainty how the country will be funded on exiting the EU-IMF programme.  We know we will need €36 billion in 2014 and in 2015 to ensure this country is fully funded.  Is it not the case that the funding options facing this country are either to borrow substantially on the markets or to have access to ESM funding?  Currently, the rate being charged under the programme is approximately 3.5%, while the markets, when I checked at lunch time, are charging 7.35% on a nine-year government bond.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">The Minister said something very significant at the outset of his response and I ask him to clarify that.  He said the advice from the National Treasury Management Agency to him as Minister is that the rejection of the treaty will mean, in its professional opinion, that Ireland will not be in a position to return to borrowing markets next year at sustainable rates.  Will the Minister clarify whether that is the advice the NTMA has given to him?</p>

            <p eId="para_743">I will reread my note again on that for the Deputy so there will be no misunderstanding - I have consulted with the NTMA and I consider that a "No" vote on the referendum on the stability treaty would mean in all likelihood that it would not be possible for Ireland to re-enter the bond markets at sustainable rates.</p>

I would regard the fact the NTMA has given the Minister the advice that the country will not be in a position to fund itself beyond next year if the treaty is rejected as a highly significant intervention.  Does that advice concur with the Minister's opinion as Minister for Finance?</p>

            <p eId="para_745">It fully concurs with my opinion.  However, the NTMA is not reflecting my opinion.  It is independent and it is charged with funding the requirements of the State.  It is the NTMA's considered opinion that a "No" vote will, in all likelihood, make it not possible for Ireland to re-enter the bond markets at sustainable rates.  What the Deputy said in his initial remarks is also true.  When it comes to the back end of 2013 - in my opinion and in the opinion of the NTMA - there will be two choices.  We can choose either to get money from the ESM or get money from the markets.  These are interrelated and the fact of having access to the ESM will make it more likely that we will be able to access money on the markets.  It will also be more likely that we will be able to get it at a lower rate of interest, because we will have an alternative source through the ESM fund.</p>

[25725/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_288" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_748">I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">As part of the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, once an excessive deficit has been identified, the focus of budgetary policy is on reducing the headline deficit to below 3% of GDP.  Following agreement with the ECOFIN Council in December 2010, we are required to correct our excessive deficit by 2015, a timeframe that balances the need for consolidation as well as the need to support economic recovery.  Under the European semester, member states are required to produce macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for the current year and for the following three years.  The Department does not have detailed macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts beyond 2015 as this is not the norm.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">Once a member state corrects its excessive deficit, it is subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, where the focus is on targeting a structural budgetary position that ensures fiscal sustainability over the medium and longer-term.  This is the so-called medium-term budgetary objective, MTO, which for Ireland is currently a structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP.  As is it part of the Stability and Growth Pact, we are required to target this MTO irrespective of the stability treaty.  Post-2015, therefore, we will be required to make progress towards meeting our MTO.  This will be done on a phased basis on the basis of a timeline to be agreed with the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">However, as I have outlined before, the exact size of the structural component of the deficit in 2015 is highly uncertain and contingent on policy measures yet to be announced or to take effect.  The range of estimates by different institutions is currently quite large and I would point out that, in the context of the stability treaty, participating member states are not bound by the EU harmonised methodology.  For national purposes, a methodology adapted to Irish circumstances can be used.   Moreover, not only do technical estimates differ depending on the approach used, but it is also the case that estimates of the structural balance further out on the forecast horizon are not fixed.  Policies being implemented at present, together with future measures, can be expected to impact positively on the current point-in-time projections.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">As I have said previously, reducing the structural element of the deficit will require policy action, though not necessarily taxation and expenditure adjustments.  Other options are available and it is the Government's intention to pursue these.  Such measures include labour market reforms, together with investment in technology and infrastructure.  By boosting the productive capacity of the economy, the ambitious programme of micro-economic reforms that is already under way is expected to help reduce the structural element of the deficit by the middle part of the decade.  For example, the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and the Pathways to Work initiative include reforms aimed at addressing some of the skills mismatch in the labour market, which should help permanently lower the unemployment rate.  This would have a structurally beneficial impact on the public finances, on both the revenue and expenditure sides.  In summary, therefore, there are many moving parts and all of these make estimates of the budgetary impact of meeting our medium term objective subject to a high degree of uncertainty.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">As part of the reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact contained in the so-called six pack of legislative reforms, member states with a debt-to-GDP ratio in excess of 60% will have to reduce the part of their debt ratio above the 60% threshold by one 20th annually.  This will have to be done irrespective of the stability treaty, although it also forms part of the treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">Ireland and the other member states currently in excessive deficit on the basis of the deficit criterion are not subject to the debt correction rule at this time.  In Ireland's case we must first stabilise our debt-to-GDP ratio.  It is forecast that this will be achieved next year.  After coming out of the current excessive deficit procedure and as a programme country we will be able to avail of a three year transition period before the full one 20th rule will apply.  This means Ireland will not be fully bound by the one 20th rule until 2019, although in the 2016-18 period we will need to make sufficient progress in terms of reducing our debt ratio.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">I reiterate the point that when it comes to meeting the debt requirement it is reasonable to expect that economic growth will do most of the heavy lifting.  To suggest otherwise is misleading.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
            <p eId="para_756">I agree with the Minister regarding the difficulty in predicting the structural deficit for 2015 and beyond.  A range of moveable factors will impact on the figures to improve them or make them worse.  However, let us deal with the Department's best predictions based on the models and expertise available to it.  Does he agree that the statement on the programme update issued by the Department in April indicated a structural deficit of 3.5% in 2015?  That would leave a gap of 3% or €5.4 billion based on GDP.  Setting aside our agreement regarding the difficulty of making projections, the Department's best attempt reveals a structural gap of €5.4 billion between the medium term objective of 0.5% and its projected figure of 3.5%</p>
            <p eId="para_757">The IMF is the only organisation to project the structural deficit post-2015.  Its country specific report, which was released earlier in the spring, indicated that the structural deficit in 2016 and 2017 would decrease marginally by 0.1% in the absence of further adjustments, even based on a growth rate of 4.9%.  Does the Minister agree that further adjustments will be needed and, in meeting those adjustments and closing the gap, will he rule out additional tax increases or cuts?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_290" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_758">I draw Deputy Doherty's attention to a statement made on "Prime Time" last night by the eminent economist, John McHale, who is chair of the fiscal advisory council.  He took the view that no additional consolidation would be required to meet the structural deficit even under very conservative assumptions about growth.  One takes note of what somebody with the stature of Professor McHale says.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">Deputy Doherty followed a good line of argument but it contained fallacies.  The 3.5% figure which the Department produced last April included the Commission's figure because it was based on the latter's calculation.  All these forecasts are done at a point in time.  Put simply, the point in time in this instance was that if no policy changes occurred between last April and 2015, the Department estimated that the structural deficit would be 3.5%.  However, the Government is evolving policy on a monthly basis.  The jobs plan drawn up by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation provides for 232 different initiatives and is being driven by the Taoiseach in a Cabinet sub-committee.  A timeline has been devised for Departments and they have to report back to the Taoiseach and provide an explanation if they are not delivering.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">During the boom years when the building industry was going great, we appeared to have a surplus but while we had one in nominal terms in fact we had a structural deficit.  If the Government of the day had taken the heat out of the building industry rather than continuing to rely on the transaction taxes the industry produced it would have addressed the structural deficit and we would not have faced the problem in 2010.  Similarly today if we retrain building workers so they do not remain permanently unemployed we can take them off the live register and do not have to pay social welfare.  We will thereby address the structural deficit.  Of course it has to be corrected but not by means of tax increases or cuts.  It is structural and if we change the structure we will address the flaws.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_291">
            <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_761">Many eminent economists take a very different view from that of Mr. McHale.  These views, which are supported with facts, figures and actual projections, indicate that severe cuts and tax increases will be necessary to reduce the structural deficit to 0.5%.  Does the Minister acknowledge that many aspects of these decisions and the implementation of the targets are being taken out of the hands of the Irish Government and placed under the control of the European Commission, which under article 3 of the austerity treaty will determine the size and pace of cuts?</p>
            <p eId="para_762">Where will the Minister find the growth that he claims will do most of the heavy lifting when all the evidence shows that austerity here and in Europe is savaging growth?  We experienced a decrease of 2.5% in GNP last year and the domestic economy slumped over the last two quarters of 2011.  That process is likely to continue as long as the Government continues to pile cuts on the Irish people.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">As a Member of the Dáil elected by the people of Limerick, is the Minister in any way disturbed by the increasing harassment and bullying of our people by all kinds of economic agencies?  The people are told they must vote "Yes" irrespective of what the treaty contains or else they will be isolated by the speculators in the markets.  They are thereby invited to divert our attention from the details of the fiscal compact treaty and its implications for our economy.  Is that not a reprehensible situation?</p>

            <p eId="para_764">The only harassment and bullying I have seen in the past couple of weeks involved supporters of the "No" campaign harassing and bullying the Taoiseach as he campaigned across the country.  They tried to prevent him from explaining the situation to ordinary, decent citizens.  Deputy Higgins should exercise influence over his supporters, if he has any, to stop this harassment of the Taoiseach and respect the dignity of his office and the offices we hold as Members of this Parliament.

            <p eId="para_766">I cited Professor McHale because of his eminence as an economist and the position he occupies as chair of the Fiscal Advisory Council.  We should give weight to what he says.  I cited his comments so that Deputies will know he made them and can give them due weight.  Of course there are other voices on the "Yes" side as well as the "No" side and some people exaggerate the position.  Our target is a nominal deficit below 3% by 2015.  Part of the nominal deficit will be structural.  It is not possible at present to say what the structural deficit will be because all estimates are based on the assumption of no policy changes that will reduce or increase the structural deficit over the next four years.  That is pure theory but does not work in practice.  We will have a number of years to deal with the structural deficit and get it down to 0.5% of GDP.  There are four ways of doing it: we can tax, we can cut, we can get the economy to grow or we can address the structural flaw.  One of the big contributors to the structural deficit is the 150,000 people who became redundant from the building industry.  If we can retrain many of them and get them back to work as well as re-employing some in the building industry through initiatives such as the one announced by NAMA this morning, we are dealing with the social welfare bill, moving away from long-term unemployment and reducing the structural deficit.  It is alarmist so to say it will be slash and burn fiscal economics for three or four years after 2015, with no choice but to cut services and tax.  That is not true.  Professor McHale said the heavy lifting will be done by growth on very modest growth assumptions, without addressing the structural flaws in the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_778">4<b>Deputy Michael McGrath</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> his views on whether all properties being sold by agents on behalf of the National Assets Management Agency or on behalf of receivers appointed by NAMA should be advertised on the open market in order that all potential interested parties have the opportunity to make an offer for the property. [25881/12]</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_779">Under the NAMA Act 2009, the sale of private property by the National Asset Management Agency is a matter for the board of NAMA.  I have no function on such matters.  I am advised by NAMA that the NAMA board issued policy guidelines in mid-2011, which set out that, in the absence of very exceptional circumstances, the sale of all property assets undertaken by debtors or receivers shall be by the appointment of suitably qualified agents and that all such sales must be appropriately marketed.  The marketing strategy for all asset disposal is determined by a range of factors, including the asset class, size, value and location.  In all events, NAMA insists on independent valuations of all assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">A key principle of the guidelines is that the conduct of disposals should be on a competitive basis and in accordance with prevailing market norms for the asset class and jurisdiction, having regard to NAMA's objectives set out in section 10 of the Act.  NAMA advises the principal methods of sale are private treaty, sale negotiated directly with a purchaser, sale by public auction, sale by public tender, sale by sealed bids, and other disposal mechanisms tailored to the specific characteristics of the underlying real estate or a combination of the above.  Sale instruction and contracts with agents and brokers require prior approval by NAMA or the participating institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">The guidelines also require that sales agents are expected to prepare a final report and recommendation addressed to the debtor and copied to NAMA.  Included in these reports should be a summary of the marketing campaign which, generally, should not be less than one month; a list of all parties who expressed interest in the real estate or were contacted during the marketing campaign; a recommendation to accept the terms of the purchaser's offer as the best price reasonably obtainable for the asset at the date of the recommendation; confirmation that the agent has reviewed purchaser's confirmation relating to connected party sales; and a statement disclosing any commercial relationship between the agent, debtor, purchaser or purchaser's ultimate beneficial owners in the past five years and how any actual or perceived conflict of interest was managed during the sales process.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">In certain limited circumstances, NAMA and the participating institutions may agree an alternative form of disposal with the debtor or insolvency office holder with, for example, more limited marketing or reporting requirements.  However, decisions on alternative forms of disposal are subject to review by the board of NAMA.</p>

            <p eId="para_785">This issue goes to the heart of the need for transparency in the operation of NAMA.  This came to my attention because of the sale of a 450 acre land bank outside Cork city.  It was sold by agents appointed by a NAMA debtor and the sale was completed without the property being put on the open market.  On further investigation, it appears this is not an unusual occurrence.  NAMA is hiding behind a facade, appearing not to be the seller even though it is pulling all the strings.  NAMA appoints receivers, who appoint selling agents or, in some cases, NAMA debtors directly appoint selling agents at the behest of NAMA.  In effect, the assets are being sold on behalf of the taxpayer and the proceeds will be used to redeem debt owed to NAMA.  There is something very wrong when NAMA cannot tell us how many of the 663 sales it has completed have been put on the open market.  Will the Minister insist that in all cases where assets are being sold by NAMA or on behalf of NAMA and where the taxpayer has a direct beneficial interest, the properties are put up for sale on the open market so all interested parties can submit bids and be considered on a fair basis?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_786">I will clarify the matter according to what NAMA told me about the sale in Cork.  In that instance, NAMA advised me the sales agent was acting on behalf of the debtor and that a competitive sales process was undertaken.  The debtor was not in liquidation.  I understand from NAMA that the sale was managed and implemented on behalf of the debtor by a firm of professional sales agents.  Following wide engagement with viable interested parties, a special purchaser emerged in respect of the entire holding of 450 acres at a price considerably in excess of that guided by the retained professionals.  It was the considered advice of the sales agent that the offer from this purchaser would be accepted.  I understand that NAMA, on receipt of this information, commissioned a second independent report by another professional firm, which agreed with the original guide price.  On the basis of the independent valuation advice, which established the price offered was 40% in excess of the two independent valuations and taking account of the fact that the offer was for the entire holding rather than for individual land plots within it, NAMA granted its approval to the debtor to proceed with the sale on the advised terms on the basis that this maximised the recovery for the taxpayer.</p>

            <p eId="para_787">With the greatest of respect to selling agents, they cannot know what property is worth until it is put up for sale on the open market.  In this case, it concerns a land bank of 450 acres of prime agricultural land with some potential for future development.  Many people would have been interested in the land bank or parcels of it.  The broad principle concerns more than just this case.  Where NAMA is selling assets through debtors or receivers, the assets should be put up for sale on the open market.  We should insist upon the principle and the Minister should exercise political judgment on the issue and not allow NAMA to enter into private deals.  Even if the deal achieves the best price, we cannot be certain.  The only way to ensure we get the best price is to put land on the open market.  As legislators, we should insist that is done in every case.</p>

            <p eId="para_788">NAMA is an independent organisation established under law by this House and the Seanad.  It is a criminal offence for anyone, including the Minister for Finance, to try to steer or influence a commercial decision being made by NAMA.  NAMA is accountable and, for example, it must produce quarterly reports.  The report on the last quarter of 2011 will be published tomorrow.  NAMA is also amenable to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The chairman and the chief executive of NAMA can be called before the Committee of Public Accounts in the normal way.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">The Comptroller and Auditor General, under law, has a special auditing relationship with NAMA and he and his team can go into NAMA and examine every piece of paper in there to see if everything was done properly and appropriately.  NAMA is also amenable to other committees of the House and an annual report is published.  There is accountability and Deputies should exercise it.  Furthermore, if there is concern about a specific aspect of NAMA's work, it is within the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to scrutinise any aspect of it.  He is not obliged to wait for the production of the annual report from his office but rather the Comptroller and Auditor General can undertake an examination of any aspect of NAMA's work.</p>

            <p eId="para_791">The overriding objective of the single currency is to enhance the living standards of the citizens of all participating member states.  This is achieved <i> inter alia</i> by greater levels of trade, a deepening of the Single Market and increased financial integration within the EU, all of which are facilitated by the single currency.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">While it is fair to say that the euro has been successful in this regard, a number of design flaws have become evident in recent years.  Perhaps the most obvious example is the greater capacity for spillover effects and unfortunately, we have seen the impact of inappropriate policies in some member states affecting other member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">In order to address these difficulties, a number of important institutional and governance reforms have been implemented in recent years.  These include the so-called six pack of legislative reforms, the euro plus pact and the European semester.  All of these reforms are designed to ensure that member states implement appropriate and sustainable economic and fiscal policies which take into account the euro area dimension.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">This retrofitting of the monetary union with the tools to make it commensurate with an economic union is a positive development and I would not understate the importance of the improvements that have been made.  However, it will clearly take some time for these reforms to bear fruit.  In addition, a five-point strategy is being implemented in order to maintain the euro area on a sustainable path.  The main elements include addressing the difficult situation in Greece, recapitalising European banks and implementing structural reforms to boost growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">From an Irish perspective, a major study of the costs and benefits of membership of the single currency was undertaken by the ESRI in the mid-1990s.

Does the Minister accept that the political and economic landscape is changing on the day?  Is there a plan B to deal with these situations?</p>
            <p eId="para_797">I ask for the Minister's response to a statement by the Nobel prize-winner economist Paul Krugman that Europe has had several years of harsh austerity programmes and the results are exactly what students of history said would happen.  Such programmes push depressed economies deeper into depression.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">Is this the current situation in the European Union?  Was the euro too much of a political project rather than an economic project?  I note the Minister in his reply accepted that there were design flaws.  Did it remove a critical shock absorber to cope with the economic imbalances?  Did all the experts and the people in the ESRI tease out that situation comprehensively?</p>

            <p eId="para_799">I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I have said on numerous occasions, both in the House and outside, that when the euro was put in place the architecture to defend it in times of adversity was not put in place.  What has been happening for the past couple of years is an attempt to retrofit the defence mechanisms for the euro and this continues.  The Deputy will know the flaws in the original design and he will know about the current attempts to put the architecture in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">Deputy McGrath referred to remarks by eminent economists.  The debate in Europe is not unique as there is an even hotter debate in the United States about whether to stimulate the economy or to balance budgets and reduce expenditure.  Views are divided strongly on political lines in the United States where there are very eminent economists on both sides of that argument.  We have to rely on authorities nearer home and take cognisance of their advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">In my view, the euro was an excellent project.  There is not a lot wrong with the euro but the problems are in certain areas of the eurozone.  For example, the level of the euro relative to the dollar at which the euro was introduced has been exceeded and despite all the difficulties, it is still at a higher value than when it was introduced.  Second, inter-country trade in Europe since the introduction of the euro, has grown by 50% and the euro is still being held as a reserve currency by many countries outside the euro area.  The euro is pretty sound but it has to be underpinned by actions which are now being taken.</p>

Does he really believe that the six pack reforms will resolve this issue and keep everybody on track?</p>

            <p eId="para_803">There is no silver bullet that will resolve everything but they are a series of actions which taken together or in sequence can help to underpin the euro.  Much of the work is already underway.  The treaty is very important as a foundation stone and also the corrective action being taken in many European countries is very important.  However, I also believe the change of emphasis in the debate now to have a programme of sustainable growth across Europe, is also very important.  Taken all together and if we keep driving forward, I believe matters will stabilise.  However, we all know there are extreme difficulties at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_804">6<b>Deputy Joan Collins</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> based on current Government projections for GDP, debt, the structural deficit and growth, the fiscal adjustments that would be necessary to meet the targets of the fiscal treaty in the first, second and third years following our exits from the current EU-IMF programme if the provisions of the treaty were to come into force at that time; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [25660/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_316" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_805">The Deputy will be aware that Ireland is scheduled to exit the EU-IMF programme of financial support at the end of 2013.  Our general Government balance targets, GGB, for 2014 and 2015, were agreed with the ECOFIN Council in December 2010.  The maximum GGB permitted is minus 5.1 % of GDP in 2014 and minus 2.9 % in 2015.  On the basis of the macro-economic and fiscal projections set out in April's stability programme update, my Department is currently forecasting that both of these targets will be met or marginally bettered.  This is based on the agreed budgetary measures.  Therefore, as I have previously said, there is nothing in the stability treaty that requires us to do more than we are already doing, over the period to 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">The growth forecasts set out in the recent stability programme update, SPU and the consolidation amounts outlined in last November's medium-term fiscal statement, are consistent with a general Government balance of just under minus 3% of GDP in 2015.  As discussed in the SPU, the exact size of the structural component of this is, of course, uncertain.  Not only do technical estimates differ, depending on the approach used, but it is also the case that estimates of the structural balance further out the forecast horizon are not fixed.  Policies being implemented at present, together with future measures, can be expected to impact positively on the figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">As I have said on a number of other occasions, reducing the structural element of the deficit will require policy action, though not necessarily taxation and expenditure adjustments.  Other options are available and it is the Government's intention to pursue these.  Such measures include labour market reforms, together with investment in technology and infrastructure.  By boosting the productive capacity of the economy, the ambitious programme of micro-economic reforms that is already under way is expected to help reduce the structural element of the deficit by the middle part of the decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">Additional information not given on the Floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">Under the Stability and Growth Pact, when a country is in excessive deficit, the focus of the fiscal effort is on reducing the headline deficit to below 3% of GDP.  In our case, the time path to achieve this objective is end-2015.  Once a country comes out of excessive deficit, the focus is on bringing a country's public finances into line with its agreed medium-term budgetary objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">As I mentioned earlier, Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective, MTO, currently stands at 0.5% of GDP.  This objective was set under the Stability and Growth Pact and well in advance of the stability treaty.  Furthermore, as noted above, estimates of the structural deficit vary in an Irish context.  What I can say is that we are making progress towards the achievement of our MTO, and further progress will be made in the post-2015 period on a phased basis, in accordance with a timeline to be agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">In terms of the debt correction rule, Ireland and the other member states currently in excessive deficit on the basis of the deficit criterion, are not subject to this at this time.  For us, the priority is to stabilise our debt-to-GDP ratio.  After coming out of the current excessive deficit procedure, and as a programme country, we will then be able to avail of a three-year transition period before the full one twentieth rule will apply.  This means that Ireland will not be fully bound by the rule until 2019, though in the 2016-18 period, we will need to make sufficient progress in terms of reducing our debt ratio.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">Lastly, I would stress again that, when it comes to meeting the debt requirement, it is reasonable to expect that economic growth will do most of the heavy lifting.</p>

            <p eId="para_813">It is true that there are a lot of variables when we are trying to project future growth rates, inflation and so on.  However, I think the Minister is covering up the facts about what we have to do to meet these targets because of the impact that might have on a vote on the fiscal treaty.  If inflation was rising significantly or if there was a significant prospect of growth in excess of the forecast on which the Minister based his budget, then he would be right.</p>

            <p eId="para_815">Is it not the case, however, that all the variables are moving in the opposite direction?  That means it is more likely that the Minister will have to make even bigger adjustments, namely cuts, in order to meet the targets when the treaty's provisions come into force.  That fact has been confirmed by Professor John McHale, chairman of the Fiscal Advisory Council.  Professor McHale wrote that in the event that nominal GDP growth were to end up 1% weaker per annum, over the period 2012 to 2105, than envisaged in the budget 2012, the debt to GDP ratio would not stabilise by 2015 without additional discretionary measures.  In other words, matters would be worse.  Since those words were written, the growth projections have been significantly downgraded.  Growth forecasts are worse, thus making the possibility of having to inflict brutal cuts to meet the fiscal targets more likely rather than less.  It is about time the Minister admitted to the Irish public that that is a real possibility arising from the provisions of the treaty.</p>

            <p eId="para_818">He is.  He is talking about the target for 2015 of getting below 3%, which is the nominal deficit.  Of course, the pace of growth and inflation has an influence on that.  The advice to me at present is that we will meet that target provided we meet the targets of adjustment that were set out in the programme.  Before the Deputy came into the Chamber, I quoted what Professor McHale said about the structural deficit.  Last night on "Prime Time", he said that no additional consolidation will be required to meet the structural deficit target.  He is basing that opinion on very conservative growth assumptions.  It is now May 2012 and if one looks at the projected deficit figure for 2015, 2016 or 2017 it is a forecast being made today for a point in time.  It is being made on the assumption, however, that there is no policy change of any sort.  If there are structural flaws in the economy, any self-respecting Government will try to address them.  On the basis of fixing the flaws the structural deficit goes, and the nominal deficit is taken care of after 2015 by modest growth assumptions.</p>

            <p eId="para_821">Is it not the case that the Minister's own figures show that even if those growth projections had held up, we would have been looking at approximately €5 billion to €6 billion to meet deficit targets post-2015?  Several billion would also be needed to meet the debt-to-GDP ratio targets contained in the treaty unless there is significant growth in the economy, which there is not because the growth projections are being downgraded.  The Minister seems to be suggesting that we can have a €200 billion debt and a 3% structural deficit, and it will not cost us anything to reduce that to 0.5% or 60% of GDP.  How can one make those sort of repayments and adjustments without it costing billions in cuts for ordinary people?</p>

            <p eId="para_822">The latest set of forecasts was published this week by the OECD, which said that the world is working its way out of recession.  It named some of the bigger economies that are doing well.  It also said its estimate of growth in Ireland for 2012 is 0.6%, and 2% for 2013.  That is actual growth, not nominal growth.  One must put inflation on top of that when one looks at the figure on which the budget is based.  The Deputy can talk about being bamboozled with facts, but that is the latest forecast.  The OECD might be right or wrong because forecasts are very inexact as circumstances change.  All we are giving is the best possible information.  On the basis of the best information I have, we will be on target at the end of the year on this budget, and will be below the target of €8.6 billion in the deficit.  We will have to make a correction next year to get below €7.5 billion.  If there is 2% growth in real terms it will be quite helpful in forming next year's budget.  That is not to say that it will not be tough.  I appreciate the stress it puts families under but there is no point in trying to undermine the basis of the figures.  I am trying to explain to the Deputy how things will be constructed.  It is difficult enough for people without exaggerating the difficulties.</p>

Can he also confirm that Professor John McHale - whom the Minister appointed as chair of the Fiscal Advisory Committee - has issued two reports calling for additional adjustments, which will be tax increases and cuts, in the budget, and that the Minister has ignored them?  If we do not meet the medium-term objectives for the structural deficit, it will trigger an automatic mechanism that will have to be legislated for in the Oireachtas.  Can the Minister explain what that automatic mechanism will be?</p>

            <p eId="para_857">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 7 and 12 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">I attended the meeting of ECOFIN on 15 May 2012 at which the following were the main points.  Ministers reached agreement on two legislative proposals to amend existing EU rules on capital requirement for banks and investment firms.  The objective of the proposals is, <i>inter alia, </i>to ensure that the effectiveness of the regulation of credit institutions and investment firms in the EU is strengthened and that financial stability is enhanced.  These proposals also aim to transpose into EU law the agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, that is the Basel III requirements, as endorsed by the G20 leaders.  The Danish Presidency can now start negotiations with the European Parliament, the aim of which is to reach agreement, if possible, by June.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">Ministers also discussed a draft Council decision to authorise the Commission to begin negotiations with five non-EU third countries - Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland - to revise agreements with those countries on the taxation of savings income in order to ensure the continued equivalence of measures in those countries with the EU savings tax directive.  While unanimous agreement on a mandate for the Commission was not reached, work will continue on this issue before the Presidency reports on tax issues to the European Council in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">Council conclusions on the sustainability of public finances in light of ageing populations were adopted, as were Council conclusions on fast-start financing of climate change measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">On its presentation of the draft EU budget for 2013, the Commission highlighted the importance of the EU budget as a driver of growth and jobs.  During the subsequent exchange of views, the importance of the EU budget as an instrument for promoting growth in Europe was highlighted.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">The Taoiseach has been very strong on supporting and advancing pro-growth measures at EU level.  In preparation for the late-June European Council, President Van Rompuy is hosting an informal meeting of EU leaders this evening to discuss how growth and jobs can be boosted across the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">We all agree that a strong resumption of growth is critical for Ireland.  I would point out that fiscal sustainability and measures to promote economic growth are not necessarily incompatible.  My view is that measures to boost the economic growth rate can play an important role in addressing the current crisis in the EU.  During a discussion on growth policies at ECOFIN I drew attention to the recent programme review mission during which we sought to strengthen the focus of our programme on growth measures.  Working with our troika partners, we will continue to stress the importance of the growth agenda to the overall success of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">Furthermore, I am continuing to explore all options that can enhance the growth agenda.  In the margins of ECOFIN last week the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I met senior officials from the EIB to explore mechanisms to access additional funding for investment in the Irish economy.  All options are being explored to secure support for appropriate projects, for example, primarily schools and primary care centres.  These projects will help generate jobs and growth in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">We have committed to a substantial capital programme of €17 billion for the period 2012-2016 already.  The intention is to complement this programme with additional projects funded through various potential sources - funds from the EIB, proceeds from the sale of state assets and use of some of the remaining funds of the NPRF.  Significant progress has been made on many fronts specifically on the use of proceeds from the sale of State assets to be used for a domestic stimulus package.  The Government is committed to getting the economy back on track and taking every opportunity to explore all options to advance the Government's agenda of jobs and growth both domestically and at EU level.</p>

            <p eId="para_866">I must put it to the Minister that yet again deception is being exercised on our people, particularly in advance of the vote in the referendum on the fiscal treaty.  Members of the Government are talking about and using the word "growth" a good deal.  We have heard its use  again by the Minister, the Taoiseach uses it a good deal and there is good deal of talk about it around the European Council summit.  However, in practice, we get austerity.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">According to the German newspaper, <i>Der Spiegel</i>, at the ECOFIN meeting referred to in the questions, the Minister was reported as having berated the Greek Government for failing to robustly enough impose austerity on the Greek citizens.  These are the same Greek citizens who have been massacred with cuts under austerity-----</p>

Is it not the case that this taken alongside the insulting comment the Minister made about feta cheese, which was insulting to the Greek people who are suffering, are not only insulting to the Greeks but indicate the Minister's Government is still, along with Angela Merkel, promoting the austerity agenda, which has crippled growth and done such damage to the lives of ordinary citizens here and across Europe, instead of seriously addressing the question of growth, which requires an end to the austerity agenda and real investment in putting people back to work?  The Minister is playing something of a double game in talking about growth on the one hand and arguing for austerity on the other hand, particularly when he is over in Europe with his EU partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">The comments attributed to me in <i>Der Spiegel</i> are totally and completely untrue.  The Greek Finance Minister came up to me after my contribution and thanked me personally for my support in the course of the meeting.  I do not know who did the spinning but it was the opposite of the views I expressed that appeared in <i>Der Spiegel</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">On the other issue about the level of trade between Ireland and Greece, to which the Deputy referred, if one is communicating to an international audience, as I was at a Bloomberg conference when everything was going out live online, and one runs a bundle of statistics at the audience, they do not know what one is talking about.  I made a very simple point that it is unlikely there will be contagion from Greece to Ireland because the links between Greece and Ireland are very limited both on imports and exports and in banking.  I used an image as there were many people in the audience.  I said that if one is in a supermarket how many items produced in Greece would one have in one's shopping basket?  I think that is a reasonable way to get an image across, especially to an international audience of investors, particularly in the United States, who quite frequently put Greece, Portugal and Ireland all in the one category.  As we have said on several occasions, there are very little similarities between the Greek economy and the Irish economy.  If one looks at the statistics, our exports to Greece are less than 0.5% of our total exports and our imports from Greece are less than one tenth of 1% of our total imports.</p>

            <p eId="para_873">Does that analysis not show a very simplistic and inaccurate understanding of what the consequences would be if there was a Greek exit from euro pushed by the austerity that has been imposed by Europe?  All the commentators, even the person who negotiated the Greek write-down of debt, have pointed out that we could face a much deeper recession if Greece is forced out of the eurozone to the degree that output across Europe could drop by 5%.  To suggest that the only impact would be sales of feta cheese is utterly simplistic, trivialises the issue and not to mention is insulting to the Greek people who are suffering so much.  Is it not the truth and a more accurate analysis that if Greece were forced out of the euro because of the determination of Europe to shove more austerity down its throat, that it could plunge Europe as a whole from recession into depression and trigger contagion right throughout the periphery and into the core of the Europe economy?</p>

If the Deputy looks back at an interview I did in Brussels on Monday, which he can pull down on the RTE website, he will note that I dealt with all the wider issues.  While I was not as alarmist as the Deputy was, I acknowledged the fact that there is a major problem in the eurozone at present because of the situation in Greece, but I was dealing with a different agenda at the Bloomberg conference - I was showing that the economic and banking connections between Ireland and Greece are very limited.  I was doing it at a point where our nine year bond rate was moving up to 7.5% because there was a perception of a direct contagion effect.  The effect is not a direct contagion one; the effect on Ireland is the consequences of a crisis in the euro because of the situation in Greece, and I have dealt with that.  I understand the position in so far as anybody understands it, but the Deputy should not ascribe to me views which I do not hold.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
            <p eId="para_875">I want to try to get an answer to this question.  I asked about the report on more cuts and tax increases and reference was made to the chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, Professor John McHale.  I asked about the structural deficit given the plans to make an €8.6 billion adjustment over the three years.  In particular I asked what the automatic correction methods would entail.  The Minister did not answer any of these questions.  The Minister speaks about growth and about Greece.  It did not do him any justice at the Bloomberg conference to laugh about putting feta cheese in shopping baskets.  If it was intended to have an effect it did not work.  Last night another rating agency put Ireland on negative watch.  Investors are not stupid.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">The Minister spoke about growth and mentioned infrastructure projects and schools.  How can the Minister speak about this?  Last year he and his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, announced that €7.2 billion would be taken from the capital budget between now and 2016.  The Minister speaks about €17 billion with regard to capital but he forgets to state this is a reduction of €7.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">How much of the €300 million we lent to Greece does the Minister expect the country to get back if Greece exits the euro?</p>

            <p eId="para_878">If I understood the Minister correctly, he stated the EU Commission would allow this country to work out its own method of arriving at what the structural deficit will be.  What will it be in 2015 and onwards?  With regard to growth, the Minister mentioned many structural adjustments and mentioned 150,000 former construction workers who should be retrained to find their way back to work.  I concur with this but does the Minister agree unless major investment is made in the economy these workers can be retrained to a high degree but they will not find jobs?  This type of investment is critical.  Does the Minister agree corporations are sitting on €2 trillion of uninvested profits in Europe and this is a massive problem?  Public investment is required.  What will the EU do about this?</p>
            <p eId="para_879">For the sake of clarity the Minister should correct what he stated earlier.  Does he acknowledge that Article 3 of the ESM treaty means any country whose crisis could destabilise the eurozone will have access to funds and this will take precedence over a recital?  In particular the Minister should correct the fact he stated the Irish Government does not have a veto over the ensconcing of the ESM treaty in EU law.  Why did the prime ministers and presidents come up with an amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to do just this if it is not required?</p>

            <p eId="para_884">What I am saying is not pie in the sky.  There has been a change in the debate in Europe and it is being driven by France.  It is impossible to state at this point what the tangible results will be.  There certainly has been at a minimum a huge change in emphasis and a very strong commitment to pursuing a jobs and growth agenda in parallel with balancing budgets in the member countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">When Deputies speak about growth the bit they always leave out is that it must be sustainable growth.  If we had €4 billion tomorrow we could get the economy growing through establishing building projects throughout the country in a Keynesian intervention.  One would not quite dig holes and fill them up again, as Keynes said on one occasion, but one could find projects.  However, when the money ran out they would stop and those employed would be unemployed.  It would be boom and bust, and the boom and bust model has been tried in Ireland time out of mind.  We need sustainable growth whereby we get the conditions for growth right and grow for 12, 15 or 20 years.  This is the type of model which has been successful in other countries.  We must get away from the boom and bust model.  This means examining every project in the stimulus package and investing only in those which actually contribute to enhancing the infrastructure to allow the economy to grow stronger.  One does not invest in projects which are purely employment creation projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_897">8<b>Deputy Seamus Kirk</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> his views on the best use of the substantial cash reserves on hand with the National Asset Management Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [25595/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_385" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_898">I am advised by NAMA that it plans to invest substantial funding over its lifetime in preserving and enhancing the assets that secure its loans, including significant investment in assets located in Ireland, and that a substantial portion of its cash reserves will be used for this purpose.  In fact, the chairman of NAMA today announced plans to invest €2 billion by 2016.  By the end of March 2012, the agency had invested more than €1 billion in the preservation, enhancement and completion of property assets underlying its loan portfolio.  More than €500 million of this had been committed to assets in Ireland and this is helping to secure the direct employment of thousands of employees in small and medium trading businesses located throughout the country, in addition to substantial additional direct and indirect construction and property related employment in general building works including re-fit, refurbishment and upgrade of NAMA-controlled properties.  NAMA advises me the other significant area in which it will employ its cash reserves is the repayment of the senior bonds which NAMA issued to fund the acquisition of its assets.  NAMA has already repaid €1.6 billion of this debt and I am aware the agency is firmly on course to meet the target of reducing NAMA debt by €7.5 billion cumulative by the end of 2013.  NAMA will achieve this target from interest and principal receipts from its loan assets and from the proceeds of asset disposals by its debtors.  Under the Act, NAMA is required to consult with me on any proposed tranche of debt repayment.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">In addition to repaying NAMA's debts and advancing working and development capital to enhance its assets, NAMA will use its cash reserves to meet the agency's ongoing funding requirements and operational expenses.  In this context I am advised the NAMA board considers it will not require additional resources from the Exchequer over its lifetime.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">In managing its liquidity needs, NAMA must ensure that it has available liquidity over the medium term to meet all of its contractual obligations as they fall due.  Such obligations, as outlined, include its day-to-day operating costs, coupon payments due on its bonds and derivative contract payments.  It also includes the advances to debtors for working capital and project funding which are often required at short notice.  I am advised that updated liquidity projections, based on these various expected inflows and outflows, are reviewed on a monthly basis by the NAMA board.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">In terms of cash management at the agency I am advised cash is either on deposit with approved counterparties or the Central Bank or invested in qualifying liquid assets such as short-term Irish Government securities.  The Deputy will be aware that €3.06 billion of NAMA's cash reserves was utilised in facilitating a short-term bridging transaction relating to the IBRC promissory note payment due on 31 March 2012.  I am advised by NAMA the rate earned on this facility is within the range of returns achieved on NAMA's short-term investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">The agency has also advised me that cash balances tend to fluctuate for a number of reasons, including the scale of NAMA's business, the fact the timing of loan and property sale transactions is not readily predictable and the time lag between cash receipts from debtors and NAMA senior note redemptions.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_386">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_904">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I welcome the statement made by NAMA today, in so far as it goes, on the investment of €2 billion over the next four years.  NAMA has access to up to €5 billion to invest in working capital and the completion of projects in its remit.  The key test is whether the €2 billion it is to invest will add more than €2 billion in value to the assets in which it is investing.  That can only be judged over time.  On 27 March the Minister confirmed to me that NAMA had cash reserves on hand of €4.3 billion and it was earning a rate of 1.1%.  As NAMA needs immediate access, it invests in liquid assets, which is just as well given that a few days later it was required to hand over €3.06 billion in respect of the bond that was issued instead of the promissory note.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">NAMA has proposed providing up to €2 billion for vendor financing.  Will that also come from its cash reserves?  Potential buyers will essentially be lent money by NAMA to buy NAMA assets.  Will that in any way reduce its ability to reach €5 billion in terms of investing in projects and working capital?</p>

            <p eId="para_911">Sinn Féin has argued we should use NAMA's cash resources to stimulate the economy so I welcome today's announcement.  I have not seen clarification on this matter in the NAMA statement.  Will the €2 billion to be invested in coming years all be spent in Ireland?  Of the €1 billion that has already been invested, more than half of it has been spent in Britain.  Given that NAMA has €5 billion in cash assets for bonds that are not redeemable until 2020, will the Minister consider issuing a direction order for NAMA to invest in other projects on which it could get a return?  For example on State projects it could get a return of 1.5% to 2% and not only on assets it has.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">I am concerned about NAMA's bonus scheme for developers.  As soon as it gets back the amount for which it bought the loans from Anglo Irish Bank or other banks, developers can keep a little bit extra.  We need to ensure that this injection of €2 billion does not allow developers, who have left bad loans with Anglo Irish Bank, AIB or Bank of Ireland for which the Irish taxpayer has picked up the tab, to benefit from this.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">I welcome that NAMA funds might be invested back into the economy to create employment and hopefully growth, which seems entirely sensible.  I agree completely with the Minister's earlier comments.  However, in what should it invest?  Are the investment and employment sustainable?  What are the long-term impacts of investing in particular areas?  Is the Minister not concerned that NAMA's focus seems to be essentially on trying to refloat the property market, which was precisely what got us into trouble?  While, of course, we need housing, I am concerned that the whole thing seems to be predicated on keeping as much as is possible the private developers, who helped us get into this mess, in business by paying them.  They will often own the assets at the end of the process rather than us owning them and also the rental revenue coming back to us on a long-term basis, which would also be a way for us to control the property market in future and prevent the sort of speculative bubble market in property which caused the crisis in the first place.  Should we not have more direct control by owning the assets that will generate revenue and wealth for the economy in the future?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_394" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_914">On Deputy Doherty's question, based on this morning's statement by the NAMA chairman, Mr. Frank Daly, my understanding is that the money about which he was talking is to be spent in Ireland.  The Deputy will be familiar with the types of projects already.  For example NAMA invested in refitting the cinemas in The Square in Tallaght.  They are now open and employing 80 people.  Previously it was a piece of dereliction in The Square in Tallaght.  It invested approximately €15 million into finishing a partially constructed shopping centre somewhere on the north side of Dublin - I do not have the centre's exact name.  There is sufficient interest for all the units to be let.  When those units are let, 280 people will be employed there.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">IDA Ireland believes that modern computer-friendly office blocks are the advance factories of this generation and that we will not be able to drive our inward investment programme without them.  It indicates that there is a shortage of them in Dublin and that by 2015 such a shortage will inhibit IDA Ireland's work.  NAMA is in negotiations with a particular developer on the quayside adjacent to the Irish Financial Services Centre to build one of those office blocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">Houses near the golf club in Dún Laoghaire have been completed with NAMA money and have been put on the market.  As nearly all of them have been sold, permission has been given for more of them, which NAMA is also financing.  Its mandate is to take over the impaired loans of banks and use the property portfolio in the best interests of the taxpayer.  It can maintain, upgrade or dispose of assets.  The bottom line is that it is acting not in the interest of developers or banks but in the interest of the taxpayer so that we get something back for the money that was used.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">NAMA frequently gets knocked, but it must be remembered that it has many enemies.  Many developers do not like what NAMA is doing.  Some developers have converted resources to their own and to their families' benefit and NAMA is going after them.  Other people are coming in with money and want to get a bargain without paying a decent price and they get offended when they cannot do a deal.  NAMA is working in the interest of the taxpayer as it is required to do under law and I am not supposed to interfere with it.  I can advise it on the general policy, but it is making the commercial decisions and so far I believe it is doing a reasonable job.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_918">I have some concerns over NAMA's intention to use €2 billion of its cash reserves on vendor financing.  In effect it will lend money to people or institutions to buy NAMA assets.  While it might look good in terms of achieving its sales targets, given that the agency is trying to reduce the debts owed to it, adding to the debts by lending money to prospective purchasers may not be appropriate.  I know it is a financing model that is well established and frequently used, but given that this is a State agency trying to reduce the money it is owed, I am not convinced of its merits.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_919">It will be a question of how it works out.  NAMA now has employees with significant experience in property development.  It would be unreasonable to suggest just running the property portfolio and selling everything if by investing a few million euro it were possible to double the price that could be achieved on the sale.  That should form part of what a property management company should do in the interest of the taxpayer thereby getting the maximum from it.  The Deputy should call representatives of NAMA to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts if he wants a longer chat. <i>  Written Answers follow Adjournment.</i>

She will be familiar with the issue, as she has responded to a previous Topical Issue question on the matter.  Some 700 children with disabilities - some moderate and some profound and severe intellectual disabilities - in the education sector are about to turn 18.  The issue is coming to the fore now because these children will no longer have access to those services next month.  Great uncertainty is being created for the families and it is causing undue stress for them.  What appears to be happening, and Deputy Walsh and Deputy Kyne are hearing this too, is a back and forth between the HSE and the service providers.  The service providers say they simply do not have the funding to deal with the issue, cannot cope within existing resources and that they are being forced to do a job they cannot do.  The HSE says there is a service plan in place and it must be implemented.  The exact details therein are disputed between the two parties.</p>

I have gone through the books with the Brothers of Charity and sat down with their chief financial officer and CEO to look at the cuts they are implementing this year and the cuts that were implemented over previous years.  It is hard to see how they can cope with the increased demand if they take on these cases without extra resources.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware that in County Galway 44 people are leaving this month, eight of whom have severe to profound intellectual disabilities.  The HSE and the service providers must come up with a solution quickly and I ask the Minister of State to intervene on the matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Walsh</from>
            <p eId="para_923">I agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Nolan.  Deputy Kyne, Deputy Nolan and I visited the Brothers of Charity services in Galway in the last few days.  They provide an exceptional service to the people of Galway city and county.  That is replicated by a host of service providers throughout the country.  It is an essential service.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">We discussed some of the figures involved.  There has been a cut of 14% since 2009 across the board nationally but in Galway's case, due to a moratorium cut in 2010, its cut in the corresponding period was 18%.  It is a cut to the bone in respect of Galway.  Approximately 85% of the budget the service receives is pay related and under the terms of the Croke Park agreement that cannot be touched.  Therefore, this year's cut of 3.7% under the service plan actually represents a 24.6% cut in non-pay items.  They are, essentially, front line services.  All the cuts must be applied to non-pay items due to the Croke Park agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">I ask the Minister to examine this issue.  It is an area that is close to the Minister's heart and she has shown great leadership in the disability sector since her appointment to office.  I am aware there is a question about the number of CEOs in the employment of the Brothers of Charity, which the Minister might address in her response.  In the case of Galway, however, and the salary that applies, I am sure each of them would gladly drop the title "CEO" in the morning if it helped the case.  It is simply a title.  There is a budget of almost €50 million in Galway and somebody at managerial level is required to manage that.  There are 1,000 staff to be managed in the services provided in Galway alone.  A manager is required to provide that service, whether one calls the person a CEO or otherwise.  I echo the sentiments expressed so far and I ask the Minister of State to intervene in this case.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Kyne</from>
            <p eId="para_926">I welcome the Minister of State.  I concur with what has been said by my colleagues.  When we met with the representatives of the Brothers of Charity services in Galway last Friday they went through the figures and the cuts they have endured.  There have been three consecutive years of cuts amounting to a cumulative reduction of €10.5 million, with €4.6 million of this accounted for in salary reductions for staff and the remainder of €5.9 million in the funding of service delivery.  This information is available in their annual report.  The Brothers of Charity have endeavoured to protect front line services, and 70% of the budget cuts have been achieved through efficiency, productivity and procurement measures.  This includes significant reconfiguration of management structures, rationalisation of administrative supports and savings on such things as transport, maintenance, catering, reductions in staff travel and changes in skill mix.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">After three years of cuts, the Brothers of Charity in Galway have utilised the reserves they prudently saved for a rainy day.  At this stage, however, they do not know how they will bridge the gap in services.  As my colleagues pointed out, eight young adults with profound disabilities are leaving the centre this year.  There is huge concern about their future and the families have great uncertainty, which is compounding the challenges which the parents and young adults face each day.  Over the last number of years the future of similar young adults has only been sorted out late in the day, often at the end of August.  We appreciate the current financial position, but the Brothers of Charity have a number of care staff and thus a high salary bill, which is protected by the Croke Park agreement.  They have done all they can to find savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">I have written to John Hennessy of HSE West and I ask the Minister to liase with that body to ensure that the front line services in Galway are protected.  There is little point in fixing the economic and financial situation in this country if we will not protect the most vulnerable young adults who had no hand, act or part in our present economic difficulties.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_931">I was joking.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  As Deputy Nolan correctly pointed out, I am acutely aware of the difficulties we face at this time which, as Deputy Kyne rightly said, is quite late in the day.  I hope to deal with that in the supplementary remarks.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline, on behalf of the Minister for Health, the position relating to the matter raised by Deputies Kyne, Walsh and Nolan.  I recognise the importance of life skills training and day services to people with disabilities who are leaving the education system and every effort is being made within available resources to provide services to all in 2012.  Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for more than 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities, who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision, to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion.  Organisations such as the Brothers of Charity play a vital part in providing these services and I acknowledge their contribution not just this year or last year but at a time when the State was not providing them.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The HSE, through its occupational guidance service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways - health funded rehabilitative life skills training; health funded day services; FÁS funded vocational training; and, extension to education placement for a specified time.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">Service providers and the HSE have come together under the auspices of the national consultative forum to identify how the needs of those individuals who require day services or rehabilitative training places in 2012 can be responded to within available resources.  I have asked to be kept informed of progress on this issue on a weekly basis.  The national consultative forum recognises that the key to ensuring that available resources for people with disabilities are used to best effect is through constructive collaboration between non-statutory providers and the HSE.  The demand for services for school leavers continues to grow.  The HSE expects that approximately 700 school leavers will require services in 2012, of which 135 are in HSE West.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">Disability services will be required to cater for demographic pressures, such as new services for school leavers and emergency residential placements from within their existing budgets.  The 2012 budgets have been reduced by 3.7% and the moratorium on staff recruitment gives rise to challenges in service provision.  In addition, the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies, and that is recognised.  However, both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner so as to be as responsive as possible to the needs of this cohort.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">The emerging Department of Health policy direction, namely, the value for money and policy review, coupled with recommendations from HSE national working groups on key service areas, including the review of HSE-funded adult day services, emphasise the need for a new model of service provision that, if agreed by the Government, will further the independence of people with disabilities in a manner which is efficient and cost-effective.  New Directions, the review of HSE-funded adult day services, was published on 29 February 2012 with a detailed implementation plan.  A working group will be established this month under the auspices of the national consultative forum to ensure that implementation plan is progressed through a collaborative approach.  I thank the Deputies and look forward to the questions that arise from this response.</p>

          <speech by="#DerekNolan" eId="spk_404">
            <from>Deputy Derek Nolan</from>
            <p eId="para_938">I acknowledge the Minister of State's comment that she is on top of the brief and is acutely aware of the position.  Having discussed the matter personally with the Minister of State, I was aware of that.  However, these services are due to end within a month and while, as the Minister of State noted, consultation is ongoing on a continuous basis between the service providers and the consultation body no resolution has yet emerged.  No answers or concrete measures are forthcoming and the impression being given to the Members who raised this issue by the service providers is they are not in a position financially to do it.  This back and forth between these two bodies is leaving the individuals in a really difficult position.  I refer to the cases about which one hears and the people who I met last Monday at the Brothers of Charity annual general meeting, who are in a really difficult position, some of whom have such severe, shocking and saddening disabilities that one cannot stop one's heart from going out to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">I ask whether an intervention can take place to force them to agree finally on something, because this cannot continue.  It is unprofessional and is a poor reflection on both the service providers and the HSE if they allow this position to continue.  I completely support the ideas put forward in the New Direction policy review, which is the way to go.  However, if the Minister of State has an opportunity in the future to visit the Brothers of Charity services in Galway, I would be greatly appreciative, were she to take the time to so do and to review their position personally.</p>

            <p eId="para_940">I note the Minister of State's response indicated this must be catered for within existing budgets.  I again stress to her that in the case of the Brothers of Charity in Galway, this simply is not there as the budget has been cut to the bone as it is.  What will happen is some families who may be receiving two or three nights of respite per month will become the focus of the cuts.  Such respite is a lifeline for them and as it is the only respite they receive, I again appeal to the Minister of State.  I note that €10 million was found last year to look after demographic funding.  The Galway services looked after five school leavers with profound intellectual disabilities, at a cost of €270,000, but that figure now has risen to eight.  While 44 people are leaving the Galway services, eight of those children have profound intellectual disabilities and I again appeal to the Minister of State to examine closely the budgets to try to re-establish this fund for 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_941">I thank the Minister of State for her response and like my colleagues, I welcome the initiatives under the New Direction policy review.  The Minister of State indicated the working group will be established this month, which is welcome in respect of implementation of the plan.  However, as I stated, the Brothers of Charity have informed the Members present that their reserves are gone.  While they had been prudent for a number of years and had been able to put aside money, these reserves now are gone.  The families are in a position similar to that which has obtained in recent years, in which a solution always has been found at the 11th hour.  At present, they are wondering whether a solution will be found this year and as matters stand, they are contacting us in a state of panic and uncertainty.  Deputies Nolan, Walsh and I have been told of the structure these young adults have had in their lives for many years, which is the bus comes for them and that is what they know.  They wait for the bus but the day will come when the bus will not and their parents are worried about what will happen then.  I again ask the Minister of State to do everything she can to ensure that funding is provided within the Brothers of Charity for these services.</p>

            <p eId="para_942">In response to Deputy Nolan, I intend to travel to Galway next Monday and as per his request earlier today, I will meet the Brothers of Charity.  While I will meet them, it is important to make a clear point.  As the Deputies rightly have noted, not alone was a last-minute reprieve granted each year but additional money was given.  Incidentally, the additional money, amounting to €1 million per year, was not something to be sneezed at but was a considerable amount of money on top of the budget.  Despite this money being provided on foot of signing a service level agreement, every year there is this crisis and no plan has been put in place.  It is both known and can be predicted into the future exactly how many children and how many young adults will need a service.  I have every sympathy with families and am deeply aware of the type of difficulties into which they now see themselves facing.  It is not that I am unaware of it, as I am, but a more structured approach really must be put in place.  There is no more money there.  I have been through all this and have made it clear there is no additional money.  It strikes me that instead of considering different approaches to respite or day services, none of this has been done.  Why would service providers not believe additional money would be made available at the last minute, as though there was some sort of golden pot out there?  That no longer is the case and those days are gone.  A structure really must be put in place that will give families certainty about where their children and adults will be into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_944">That is what is important and the Government is working through that process.  It will intensify its efforts and will be obliged to take a serious look at how things are done in the future and how one can make people with disabilities more independent.  We must work through that process collectively and must ensure this happens.  I will keep a very close eye on it this year and am being briefed on a weekly basis.  Things can happen such as, for instance, collaboration on back-office processes and not the front-line stuff.  Equally, I note that disability is not a poor service and enormous amounts of money are being spent on disability.  I believe it can be done differently and a better service can be provided.  I acknowledge a point comes at which one is able to do less with less.  I am not foolish enough to believe such a point will not be reached, although I hope not.  However, a different service must be delivered that will be more beneficial to people with disabilities and their families.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
            <p eId="para_947">Yesterday, there was a debacle in County Donegal when officials from Revenue and agents acting on its behalf sought to remove machinery from Highland Bakery, which is located on the outskirts of Letterkenny.  The employees working there then barricaded themselves in and a stand-off ensued between Revenue officials and the staff there.  The background to this matter is that like many good businesses, the owner has got into difficulties and owes money to Revenue.  While he does not dispute this, the issue is how can a sustainable repayment plan be arrived at.  At present, the owner, Kevin Bradley, is being asked to repay €20,000 per month, which is not sustainable.  The question and dilemma for Revenue is there are 28 workers and 15 drivers involved, making 43 employees in total.  If one multiplies that number by the €20,000 per year each it would cost the State, the final amount this would cost the State per year runs to hundreds of thousands of euro.  I appeal to the Revenue Commissioners to engage immediately with the owner, who has assured Deputy Doherty and I that he wants to resolve this issue and maintain his business, in respect of which he has a full order book.  Like many other businesses, while previously he was paid upon delivery it is often a month or longer now before he gets paid.  As such, he has difficulties with cash flow.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">I assure the Minister that the owner wants to repay what he owes but on a sustainable basis.  I appreciate that Revenue has a job to do and that the taxes it collects are required to run our health and education services and so on.  However, I appeal to the Minister and his officials to intervene to resolve this problem and, more important, to ensure jobs are saved in Donegal, where, as the Minister will be aware, there is a huge problem in terms of unemployment and emigration.  The business concerned has been successful and can continue to be successful with some assistance from the Minister.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_413">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
            <p eId="para_949">As stated by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, this issue relates to a company that has been trading in Donegal for well over a decade.  I appreciate that Revenue is independent and has to a job to do, which it does well, in terms of the collection of outstanding tax liabilities.  The problem is that the scope of Revenue is to collect as much tax as possible without factoring in the wider impact in this regard.  For example, had workers not barricaded themselves into the factory yesterday and the sheriff had gained access with his low loaders and taken away machinery, all of them would have been heading to the social welfare office today, which would, as stated by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, cost the State, on average, €800,000 per annum or €20,000 per person, which is disproportionate to the tax liability of the individual concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">The individual concerned wants to pay his liability but to do so in a manner which allows him to sustain his business.  While I accept that Revenue is independent, I ask that the Minister intervene in some way to resolve this issue, which does not only affect Highland Bakery.  I was contacted this morning by a constituent who has been given seven days to pay half of his tax liability, which is impossible for him to do, or the sheriff will be called in, following which 14 people will lose their jobs.  I was also contacted last week by another individual who, having been visited by the sheriff the day after he paid his liability, in respect of which I accept payment was late, must now pay sheriff's fees.  I spoke in committee about a young girl who had set up her own business in which she employed another individual.  She was visited by the sheriff in respect of a €2,000 tax liability and had to scrape and scrounge to get the money together to ensure her equipment was not repossessed but as a result of which she had to lay off her employee.  There are 21,000 unemployed people in Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">While I accept that Revenue has a job to do, putting these companies out of business will cost the State more money in the long term.  Each of the companies concerned is willing to enter into a phased repayment arrangement with Revenue.  I appreciate there are chancers who have money and assets who do not want to pay their taxes.  However, I am assured that some of the individuals of whom I speak have already paid their bills but are being charged additional fees by sheriffs.  While I accept that sheriffs have a job to do, their actions infringe on the mental health of individuals who are struggling and do not wish to put other people out of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">There has been much talk about job creation.  Some 42 jobs are at risk in Highland Bakery and 12 jobs are at risk in the other company, the details of which I can give to the Minister at a later stage if he so wishes.  I ask the Minister to review the wider scope of Revenue and the impact of repossessions which automatically close companies.  In terms of Highland Bakery, if this matter is not resolved 42 people will lose their jobs, which will have other spill over effects in terms of non-payment of bank and other liabilities and a loss of revenue to the State by way of payment of PAYE, PRSI, the universal social charge and so on.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_414">
            <from>Minister for Finance  (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_953">I thank Deputies Mac Lochlainn and Doherty for raising this matter.  I believe it would be entirely inappropriate for me to comment on any alleged or perceived dispute between Revenue and an individual taxpayer or business.  For reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, Revenue cannot disclose details of or comment publicly on the specific affairs of any individual business or taxpayer, which is entirely appropriate.  I also believe that intervention by me in a dispute between Revenue and a particular business or taxpayer would not be appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">It is a long standing convention that the Minister for Finance does not intervene in matters of dispute between Revenue and an individual taxpayer.  In that context, I remind the House of the provision at section 101 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 enacted last year by the Oireachtas which provides for the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of its functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">Revenue plays a critical role in securing and delivering a significant part of the financial resources required by Government to provide services and facilities for all our citizens.  A delay in collection of the revenues due impacts on the level and timeliness of financial resources available to Government.  It also facilitates those who withhold tax and PRSI payments and use those moneys to improve cash flow to gain an unfair competitive advantage over tax compliant competitors.  The primary goal of the Revenue Commissioners is to ensure that all taxpayers and businesses meet their tax and customs obligations in a timely fashion.  It expects that taxpayers and business organise their financial affairs to ensure that they pay their tax and PRSI debts on time.  In this regard, Revenue promotes and supports voluntary compliance by facilitating taxpayers and businesses in meeting their obligations in as easy a way as possible through the provision of a quality customer service.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">I am satisfied that Revenue approaches the task of securing the collection of the critical taxes and duties payable to the State in an efficient manner.  Internationally, Ireland is among those countries that make it easiest for taxpayers to pay their taxes.  Revenue is very conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate that prevails and of the challenges for business in being timely compliant.  Since the start of the economic downturn, Revenue has responded by actively encouraging businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise.  This approach is designed to facilitate the identification and development of an agreed approach between Revenue and the businesses concerned to those difficulties so as to quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.  Revenue has developed an administrative framework to manage such cases, and has published on its website comprehensive material and guidance for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties.  I am aware that tax practitioners and representative bodies have acknowledged Revenue's very positive efforts in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">Revenue will endeavour to work with a viable business towards resolving the issues giving rise to default in making its tax payments.  It has worked successfully with thousands of businesses over the past number of years in addressing such difficulties, thus saving further thousands of jobs that would otherwise have been lost.  I am advised by Revenue that crucial to the success of its approach is meaningful, realistic and early engagement by the business or taxpayer concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_958">I thank the Minister for his response.  I accept that the Minister is unable to intervene for legal reasons.  However, it is, as Deputy Doherty pointed out, critical in the case of Highland Bakery that Revenue look at the wider impact of an unsustainable repayment plan.  The cost to the State, in terms of social welfare payments if the 42 employees lose their jobs, will be €20,000 per person or €800,000 per annum, which is multiples of the amount owed.  Surely, it makes sense for Revenue to put in place a sustainable repayment plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The business owner was recently involved in an accident, which may have caused some difficulties in terms of communications.  While I accept that Revenue must be independent of the political system, it is hoped it will listen to our views in terms of the economic environment and our belief that this matter can be resolved.  It is hoped that following this unfortunate stand-off, which is not in anybody's interests, Revenue will engage with the business owner and agree on a sustainable repayment plan that is in everybody's interest.</p>

          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_416">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
            <p eId="para_960">I will just add to that and reiterate that Revenue is very efficient.  There have been weaknesses in the past but it does its job well.  There is no doubt the sheriff could have got access to Highland Bakery yesterday.  The low loaders and lorries were there and were taking away the machinery.  Only the workers were left, who barricaded themselves in.  If the sheriff gets access to that business, he will be able to recoup the money on behalf of Revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">The Minister, as Minister for Finance, this Parliament and this State will be down more money, as Deputy Mac Lochlainn acknowledged; some €800,000 for 42 employees.  There is very little opportunity for any of those workers to find a job in County Donegal, which has 21,000 people unemployed.  I realise Revenue is working with other businesses and that is fine, but there are four files on my table, as I explained to the Minister, on which they are not working.  The people in question are willing to pay their liabilities but in a way that can sustain employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">I know the Minister has limitations in this regard but I ask him to look at the role of Revenue, a role that might have been fit for purpose in better times.  Perhaps it needs a direction or a change of legislation.  At this time, however, when jobs are our number one priority, Revenue must take on board the impact of closing down a business.  As the Minister remarked, it is not solely about recouping outstanding liabilities for the taxpayer.  If there is a need for amendment in that regard, we would support it.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">I know Revenue has to push the owners of companies such as this as far as it can but if it pushes them too far it will close down the company, there will be a loss of tax revenue and people will be unemployed.</p>

            <p eId="para_964">Usually the sheriff arrives only after many other approaches have been made by Revenue.  It is usually a recourse of last resort.  If I may suggest it, the Deputies are entitled under law to make representations to Revenue on behalf of a constituent.  There is nothing improper in that as has been made clear on a number of occasions.  The Deputies should probably talk in the first instance to the company's accountants so that they are not at cross purposes, proposing something different from what has been proposed.  They will also need the written permission of the person they represent so that they do not breach the confidentiality Revenue needs to maintain with a taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">I am probably the last person in the House who can approach the Revenue because I have to maintain a very strict relationship and respect its independence.  There is nothing improper, however, if the Deputies take up the cause and approach Revenue directly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
            <p eId="para_968">I thank the Minister of State.  We are getting used to these exchanges.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">One of the sad points about this is that we are obliged to have a discussion about it at all.  Dissident republican activity has been escalating in recent months.  A significant number of bombs have been located and diffused by Army experts and Derry has been rocked by explosions earlier in the year.  This is compounded by splinter republican groups, such as RAAD in Derry, which continue to terrorise their communities.  Continued cross-Border co-operation on dissident groups between security forces needs to be maintained and developed.  Continued investment in areas blighted by paramilitary activity should remain a priority for both the Government and the Opposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">Last night in Derry the police found a number of explosive devices in a flat and arrested a man suspected of republican dissident activity.  Police stated the devices were found in a flat in a built-up residential area and could have caused significant damage or serious harm.  Residents, including elderly people, children and disabled people were evacuated from the area.  This highlights the ongoing threat that dissident republican activity represents to the lives of ordinary decent families throughout the North of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">On Monday last, seven men engaged in dissident republican activity were charged with engaging in conduct in preparation for committing acts of terrorism, possession of a firearm andammunition, and attending a place used for terrorist training.  The men were charged with offences relating to an alleged terrorist training camp near Omagh.  Clearly, these groups are organised and attempting to upskill and ramp up their terrorist activity.  In January of this year two bombs exploded in Derry, for which the Real IRA was presumed to be responsible.  We know the Real IRA has an active unit in Derry which has been responsible for a number of attacks on symbolic targets across the city.  Two years ago the terror group bombed a branch of theRoyal Bank of Scotland-owned Ulster Bank, and last year admitted responsibility for two bomb attacks on branches of the Bank of Santander.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">The Republican Action Against Drugs, RAAD, group was highlighted on last night's "Prime Time" programme.  This is a vigilante group associated with dissident republican activity and was set up four years ago.  RAAD bombs, shoots, exiles and threatens those it decides are guilty of drug dealing or anti-social behaviour.  It is a small organisation, with an estimated membership of between 20 and 50, but it is having an extraordinarily chilling effect on a city that is to be the 2013 City of Culture.  Reports indicate there have been at least 26 RAAD shootings in the Derry area which resulted in casualties.  The group has detonated 21 pipe bombs.  Community activists estimate that RAAD has threatened around 200 young men from Derry and exiled as many as 30 in the past three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">In February, RAAD murdered a Derry native, Andrew Allen, near Buncrana, County Donegal.  Its activities have spilled over the Border, therefore, as it hunts down people it believes to be guilty of drug dealing.  It must be put on record that the Allen family completely rejects this accusation.  RAAD told "Prime Time" it intends to begin targeting the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  This would mark a major escalation of its campaign of violence and would further threaten the peace process and the normalisation of life in the Six Counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The PSNI's success against RAAD has been poor so far, with no prosecutions to date for any RAAD shooting and only three prosecutions for other crimes committed by suspected members of this organisation.  The PSNI says it needs more co-operation from the community to get convictions and points out that even those that RAAD has shot are typically too afraid to give adequate witness statements.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">The key to solving these problems is targeting investment in areas which are affected by dissident activity and ensuring that these communities co-operate with the PSNI investigations intothe criminal group, RAAD, and other dissident republican activities.  EU funding and cross-Border initiatives should continue to focus on developing these areas and strengthening the normalisation process.  The spill-over of violence across the Border highlights the need for ongoing co-operation between the PSNI and An Garda Síochána.  Information sharing and an assessment of the threat in places like Derry should be shared amongst the forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">Details of the exiling of people, as picked up by the PSNI, should be forwarded to the Garda as many of these individuals who are forced into exile live in the Republic.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Lucinda Creighton)</from>
            <p eId="para_977">I am replying to this matter in the absence of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore.  The peace process and the Good Friday Agreement have resulted in a transformation of society in Northern Ireland, perhaps most visibly in the normalisation of daily life and the dramatic decrease in terrorist-related incidents and violence.  There remains, however, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, a substantial threat from so-called dissident republican paramilitary groups who continue to assert their determination to impose violence and a return to conflict on the people of Ireland towards an as-yet undefined end.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The threats to peace as posed by dissident groups are undoubtedly serious.  Since 2009, a series of violent attacks by these dissident groups have taken place, resulting in injuries and in the deaths of two British Army personnel and two Catholic PSNI officers.  The deaths of Sappers Quinsey and Azimkar and Constables Carroll and Kerr, and the continuing threats against the Police Service of Northern Ireland, are viewed with widespread revulsion across society on the island of Ireland.  It is clear that these people enjoy no popular support within the community.  They have nothing to offer the people of Ireland.  They have been overwhelmingly rejected.  Nothing showed this more clearly than the united cross-community response to the brutal murder of Constable Kerr just over a year ago.  It is evident too in the more recent response by the people of Derry to publicly protest against the mindless actions of a minority who seek to impose their will on the community through violence.  Strong and deepening co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland is doing much to counter such individuals and groups, who are flying in the face of the clearly and democratically expressed will of all the Irish people who share the island of Ireland.  The number of arrests in connection with dissident activity made in both jurisdictions continues to be significant.  The Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland will continue to co-operate closely to combat dissident activity on both sides of the Border.  The joint statement by the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, on British-Irish relations in March of this year underlined the wish of both governments to see Northern Ireland move from peace to reconciliation and prosperity.  Our joint efforts in support of these objectives must and will continue.  Above all, we stand together with the people of Northern Ireland and its Executive in our determination to make sure they are never again blighted by violent conflict.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">I welcome the Minister of State's statement that there is close co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda.  It is vital for that to continue.  There is a need for initiatives in the Twenty-six Counties area to counter dissident activity.  As we are well aware, it is happening here as well.  We need to be conscious that the areas of greatest deprivation in the Six Counties are the most fruitful recruitment grounds for these dissidents.  There needs to be a strong resolve on the parts of the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure there is a continued flow of targeted investment to combat disadvantage in such areas.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me in that regard.  Perhaps she can give some specific details of what the British and Irish Governments are doing to ensure these areas are developed.  That is necessary to encourage people to move away from the path of violence and to reduce the attraction of dissident groups for young unemployed males, in particular.</p>

I am sure the Tánaiste will discuss the matter with the Deputy in the House when he gets an opportunity to do so.  It is clear that substantial funding is being spent through various North-South initiatives on either side of the Border.  I agree with the Deputy that the most logical way of proceeding in this regard is by tackling the most disadvantaged and deprived areas.  He alluded to the substantial EU funding that is being spent on cross-Border co-operation through the PEACE and INTERREG projects.  I hope and believe we will be able to secure continued funding during the negotiations on the new budget outline for the period between 2014 and 2020.  Resources are being channelled in a strategic and targeted way.  The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Commissioner have both gone on the record to acknowledge the excellent relationship they have and to emphasise their joint determination to target security and policing problems.  I hope everybody in this House is united on the need to ensure we can end this scourge both North and South of the Border.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise this issue, along with Deputy Boyd Barrett, in the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon.  I am raising the need for a new school building at Newpark Comprehensive School in Blackrock, County Dublin.  This issue affects many of my constituents in the north Wicklow area who attend the school in question.  When the school was built in 1972, it was designed to cater for a maximum of 400 students in a building that was due to last for 20 years.  At present, the school has 830 students, which is a real sign of its success in the community and the high regard in which it is held.  It is about to celebrate its 40th anniversary in the same building, which was supposed to have been replaced after 20 years.  The school first made contact with the then Department of Education regarding the need for a replacement building as long ago as 1995.  Although many years have elapsed since then, it continues to find itself in this difficult situation.  In February 2000, the Department's own inspectors published a report stating that a new building was required.  Nine years later, the Department approved a new building at Newpark Comprehensive School to go to tender.  Planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála in March 2011.  The project was listed on the eTenders website in November 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The Minister of State will understand the deep sense of disappointment among the students, parents and teachers at Newpark Comprehensive School, as well as the wider community, when the Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced in the 2012-16 schools building programme that the construction of a new school building would not take place until 2015 or 2016.  This news was a source of substantial frustration because the school had been waiting for a long time for the new building that had been deemed necessary by the Department's inspectors.  While we welcome the school building programme and the continued investment in schools, there has to be a degree of flexibility within the programme to allow schools that are urgently needed to be developed at a quicker pace.  Newpark Comprehensive School is the only non-fee paying Church of Ireland school in a very wide area.  I can go through some of the detail of the real issues that need to be resolved at the school with the Minister of State if he wishes.  This matter needs to be attended to much more quickly.  We welcome the fact that construction of a new school building is on the list, but it needs to happen now rather than in 2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_983">I have to admit a certain personal interest in this matter.  I am the father of a child who attends Newpark Comprehensive School.  Another one of my children will go there in a few years time.  As Deputy Harris said, Newpark Comprehensive School caters for 830 children.  It is one of the few non-fee paying secondary schools in its large catchment area, which extends from County Wicklow to parts of Dublin like Booterstown and Mount Merrion that are closer to the city centre.  I suggest that the current economic crisis will lead to an increase in the demand for non-fee paying schools.  I cannot overstate the anger, frustration and disappointment of the parents, staff and students of the school when they heard the news in December of last year - 17 years after the Department accepted that the school needed a new building, such was its level of dilapidation even at that stage - that it was not listed to receive the rebuild that was expected to take place this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">The school has spent 17 years going through all the hoops, working up designs, getting planning permission, going through appeals and battling to get its dilapidated building rebuilt.  Even though the Department accepts a new building is needed, it has taken the school off the list and said the rebuild will not happen until 2015.  Tiles are falling off the roof of the school.  Its science laboratories do not have proper running water all of the time.  It has lighting problems and disability access problems.  There are rotten smells in the school corridors.  The science rooms are not of the standard required to deliver the science syllabus.  In many cases, the toilets are completely inadequate.  There are problems with people tripping over, etc., because of problems with the floors.  There are all sorts of problems.  The school is seriously dilapidated.  The Department accepted 17 years ago that a new school was needed.  I urge the Minister and the Department to deliver the rebuild of this school.  It should not be delayed until 2015.  It should be put back on the list for this year or for 2013, at the very latest.</p>

            <p eId="para_985">I am responding to the Deputies who have raised this Topical Issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  I thank the Deputies for giving me an opportunity to outline the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects over the next five years and to clarify the current position in respect of the provision of new building at Newpark Comprehensive School in Blackrock, County Dublin.  The building project at the school has been included in the five-year construction programme and is scheduled to commence construction in 2015-16.  It is one of 275 projects which have been scheduled to commence construction over the five years of the programme.  In scheduling when each project can proceed to construction, the Department has to take account of the funding available annually and the requirement to provide additional school places to meet the increasing demographic needs the Minister outlined when he launched the programme.  In summary, those demographic needs involve a total national enrolment which is expected to grow by around 70,000 students between now and 2018.  This will entail an increase of over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary, while second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise thereafter until at least 2024.  As the Deputies may be aware, in June 2011 the Minister announced that 20 new post-primary schools are to be established up to 2017 across a number of locations to cater for the increasing student numbers at post-primary level alone - that is 20 new schools which are currently not in existence.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">The design of the proposed new school building for Newpark comprehensive has been developed based on a long-term projected enrolment of at least 800 students - the current enrolment is 831.  A stage 2(b) submission was received in the Department on 4 May and is currently under review.  Once that review is complete, the Department will be in contact with the school authority.  However, due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the funding available each year for the provision of new school accommodation to meet the increasing demographic requirements, the project for Newpark comprehensive has been scheduled to commence construction in 2015-16.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">I appreciate the Minister of State's response.  I ask that he asks the Department officials to reconsider this issue.  The Department has recognised the need for this new school build; it is clearly a matter of timing and of priority.  If one looks at the overall list, there is scope for a degree of flexibility for the very reasons outlined by Deputy Boyd Barrett in regard to the very serious issues in terms of health and safety, the wide catchment area the school is appealing to in terms of its denominational background and the provision of the science syllabus, given that, according to the Department inspectors, the science labs cannot meet the new science syllabus.  As an extra kick in the teeth, funding has been withheld from the school for the upgrade of those labs because it had been promised the new school building.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">There is a real need to show there can be flexibility in this list.  I ask the Minister of State to ask his officials to reconsider this.  In light of the case I and Deputy Boyd Barrett have presented today, I hope a successful resolution can be found and that this school, which is much needed and has been long awaited, is delivered as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_989">The Minister of State's response is not adequate.  The parents, students and staff have been fighting for this school and they have gone through all the hoops for 17 years.  The Department has long since accepted the urgent need to rebuild this school to enable it to deliver the education syllabus and to provide adequate surroundings in order for 830 students to learn.  At present, the school is a health and safety hazard.  It is not suitable for the job it is supposed to do, namely, to teach more than 800 young people and educate them properly.  It is not fair on the students, staff and parents to delay this when they have done everything right and when the Department itself has accepted they deserve this rebuild.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">I appeal to and urge the Minister to reconsider this and to give a commitment that the rebuild of Newpark school will go ahead this year or at the very latest next year, as was expected and as the Department had indicated would happen.  It is simply not fair, justified or acceptable that this should be delayed for another few years which, I suspect, would leave parents, students and staff believing they will never get the rebuild and that it will always - again and again - be put on the long finger when it is so urgently needed.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that he will review this and do something to help the extreme anger and frustration of the parents, staff and students of Newpark, who deserve their new school?</p>

            <p eId="para_991">I will certainly undertake to pass on the concerns of both Deputies to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and in turn I assume they will be passed on to the officials in the Department's building unit.  The first point is that one of the reasons this list was published was to provide complete transparency in the school building programme, something we have not had in the past.  In the past, as Deputy Boyd Barrett noted, boards of management were obliged constantly to liaise and, indeed, pressurise the building unit in Tullamore to deliver on particular projects.  Boards of management and parents were not aware at any point where they stood in terms of having their school developed.  What the Minister, Deputy Quinn, sought to do with the publication of this list was to bring complete clarity to that situation, which is very much welcomed by the vast majority of boards of management across the country, particularly those fortunate enough to be on the list.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">Second, some 275 projects are included in the list and it physically is not possible to get all of them off the ground within the first couple of years.  Third, the decision for the phasing of these was built around very sound data from the CSO and the Department of Social Protection in regard to children's allowance records in each area.  One can only conclude that the officials in the building unit made the decision to phase in Newpark in Blackrock towards the end of the five-year programme based on the demographic challenges that are arising within its catchment area.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">I would argue the school is most fortunate to be on the list because, since that list was published, I and I am sure the Deputies have had numerous communications from other schools that were not fortunate enough to be on the list.  Other schools are waiting far longer than 17 years.  I visited one school recently where the first, second and third years are accommodated in a building that was built in the late 19th century, is completely unsuitable to the needs of a modern school and is inherently dangerous.  Those schools were also on the cusp of going to development and some already had their contractors appointed.  Now, they have been told they are being put on pause indefinitely until such time as this particularly urgent list is delivered upon.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">Newpark is on the list.  I will undertake to pass on to the Minister the Deputies' concerns about perhaps moving it up to an earlier date for construction.  However, I wish to stress that the school is most fortunate to be in the position of being on the list and that the decision to move the development out towards of the end of the programme is based on sound census and demographic data from the area which the school serves.</p>

          <p eId="para_996">The question is what can be done about the serious crisis in our third level institutions, including our universities.  I put it to the Government there are some things it can do right now which will begin to address this growing crisis, and the first of these is to increase funding.  The Minister will be aware of the Hunt report, which stated an extra €500 million was needed to plug the gap in college funding up to 2020.  Universities themselves must get a lot better at fund-raising, and they can look to the US universities as probably the best in the world at this.  The Government can play an active role in helping them to achieve this.  In particular, it could provide low interest or zero interest rate loans on student fees whereby, as in models such as the UK's, these would kick in once the graduate's salary reached a certain level.  It would be very important that the additional fees were ring-fenced to improve teaching quality for the students.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">We can also look at recruiting more students from overseas.  Some 1.3 million Chinese students attend foreign universities, with 100,000 studying in London alone last year.  It is estimated each of these spends some Stg£20,000 between fees and living expenses, making it an industry worth Stg£2 billion every year.  There is a huge market, if we can get the rankings of our universities high enough up the tables that they can attract foreign students.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">More choices can be made in terms of diverting money to the universities.  For example, a short-term increase in higher-end income tax would raise several hundred million euro which could be invested in the universities.  Not paying increments would save €250 million which could be diverted to third level institutions and universities.  The Government has made the choice to cut that money from our third level institutions and to pay increments at a time of national economic crisis.  These are not smart choices for the future of this country or for the future of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">It may seem a strange thing to suggest that we should invest more in the middle of an IMF mission, but I would like to draw the Government's attention to the case of Finland.  In the early 1990s, Finland broke away from the Soviet Union, its major trading partner.  Unemployment in Finland went up from 3% to 18% and Finland increased its investment in education and research and development.  This is something we must do.  We must get serious about setting a vision and some targets.  We must stop massaging the data, suggesting we are doing fine.  We are not doing fine.  The data is unambiguous and our universities are in freefall.  This is a national crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">We must expect more of ourselves and must expect and demand more of our educators.  Other countries do this successfully.  For example, Singapore has two universities in the top 100 in the world, Switzerland has three and the Netherlands has five.  This can be done and is by no means beyond our ability, but we must set the vision that this is what we will achieve.  Otherwise, it will not happen.  We must also give universities the tools they need to transform their performance as they do not have these tools currently.  A comment made by a former president of UCD comes to mind.  In response to some criticism some years ago, he said: "You want me to give you a world class university, but I have to pay my best professor and my worst professor exactly the same wage.  I cannot do it."  A former president of DCU on the same issue said: "You want me to turn DCU into a world class university, but 80% of my spend is beyond my control.  I cannot do what you want if I only control €1 in €5 that I get."  We must recognise that this cannot be done unless we let these people find and hire the best staff, give them the freedom to equip those staff to teach in a world class manner and hold them accountable for what they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">We must emphasise the teaching.  Many of us know that in a significant number of third level institutions, teaching, in terms of career advancement, is not taken seriously.  The advice many young staff looking for academic posts are given is to concentrate on their research, get papers out and not worry too much about the teaching because that is not what will get them posts.  We must change that culture or this will not work.  There is little formal feedback from students and they do not really have a voice.  Someone could be teaching rubbish year after year and although all the students are aware of that, they have no voice.  They have no ability to feed into the system and suggest that this person should not be teaching them.  It would be interesting to discover how many teaching staff in our third level institutions have been removed from their posts over the past five years for bad quality teaching.  It would also be interesting to discover how many had been promoted for providing excellent teaching.  I suspect the numbers would be very close to zero.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">In summary, the crisis of falling standards in our schools, third level institutions and universities is as important as the debt, banking and economic crises.  If we do not sort this crisis, it will be as big a medium to long-term problem as the economic crisis is in the short term.  We have an opportunity to act and the Government can make some choices.  It can reverse the cuts.  Finland did it in the 1990s and we can do it.  The tough decisions should be made.  We can and should set bold and ambitious targets and the management teams must be given the tools they need to help them change the culture, get the best people, support them and hold them accountable.  If we do that, we can begin to turn the situation around.  The new qualification and quality assurance authority is a first step, but the Government must go much further.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_1003">Like others, I broadly welcome the amalgamation of HETAC, FETAC and the National Qualification Authority into this new body, the QQAI.  It makes sense to tidy up and streamline the various bodies that deal with quality assurance and educational awards and to make them compatible with similar systems across Europe.  However, following on our discussion earlier on schools like Newpark, the best quality assurance in the world is meaningless if we do not put the necessary resources into the provision of education.  It is difficult to see how even the most beautifully streamlined quality assurance structure or administration will make a blind bit of difference if we have secondary school students trying to learn science, for example, in science labs that are not fit for purpose, where tiles are falling off roofs, there is no hot running water, there are serious health and safety issues and where hazardous science equipment is stored unsafely.  This is just one school.  The Minister of State made the point earlier that there are other schools even worse.  It is an alarming prospect if that level of dilapidation exists in the amenities and facilities available at second level for students and, similarly, when significant budget cuts are imposed at third level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">This is all happening against a background where, essentially, a demographic bomb is working its way through our education system, in that approximately 10,000 extra young people are joining the education system every year.  This will work its way up through second and third level.  If we cut our already inadequate resources, facilities and amenities and cut budgets, we are storing up a very large problem.  As Deputy Donnelly said, if there is any way out of the economic mess we are in, it is through investing in all levels of our education system and in our young people.  This is critical if we are to chart a way out of the mess.  In the end, skilled and educated people are the raw material that will allow us work our way out of economic crisis.  Cutting budgets and resources for education in general seems a little like shifting deck chairs on the Titanic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Other concerns have been raised with me.  There is significant concern among staff of the various authorities being amalgamated and merged with regard to conditions.  Whereas their remuneration will not be affected, it is unclear in the Bill whether they can transfer their conditions, entitlements and pension rights when they move to the new body.  Can the Minister of State give us some assurance that there will be no interference with or downgrading of their terms and conditions or pension entitlements, given the new single pension scheme, and so on?  Can he clarify what their rights and entitlements and other terms and conditions will be when they move to the new amalgamated body?</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Another important issue is the composition of the board of the new body.  A number of people involved in the education sector have raised a concern about the lack of stakeholder involvement.  There is a lack of representation of education providers and, I might add, students, on the new board.  On 27 March, I asked the Minister about the lack of involvement of stakeholders on the board and I am concerned by the response I received.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">He could not justify stakeholder involvement on the board because it would make it unwieldy and he intended to confine its membership to suitably qualified individuals who had an appropriate mix of skills and experience in areas such as corporate governance and financial expertise.  What the hell has corporate governance and financial expertise got to do with an authority that is responsible for educational standards?  A mindset that prioritises corporate governance and financial expertise over educational expertise is a cause for concern.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the decision to exclude stakeholders because, given their knowledge of education, they are the best qualified people to judge standards and awards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">Representatives of English language schools have described the economic benefits of involving them as stakeholders on the board.  One individual pointed out that the failure to reserve a place on the board for language schools was a break with past practice and that it would deny the sector access to decision making at an executive level.  This individual felt strongly that, as major stakeholders in the international sector, approved language schools should have a voice at that level and that their absence would have a detrimental effect on regulation of the sector in the long term.  Every 100 international students from places like the Middle East and Asia produce 15 additional jobs in the economy.  One teaching post is created for every 15 students.  This is an expanding area for the small and medium enterprises that the Government claims it wants to support.  Why are the experts in this area not represented as stakeholders on the board?  Similar arguments could be made in respect of other third level areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">I am not saying administration, financial expertise and corporate governance are completely irrelevant to quality assurance in the education system, but why is the emphasis on these skills rather than the involvement of stakeholders and education providers?</p>

        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_433">
          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_1010">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Deputy Donnelly made reference to China and London.  University College Cork has an extensive relationship with Shanghai and China generally.  The European Chinese experience is working quite well in UCC and is bringing economic benefits to the university and the city.  Furthermore, it shows the world that we have a university with world class standards that puts learning at its core and has established itself in China.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">It is important that we take a holistic approach to this debate by considering standards of and access to learning and what we want from education.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Cannon, is closely involved with developing a model of education which requires movement and change.  As a school teacher, I recognise the dedicated and committed teachers who work in every classroom and every school.  At all levels of the education system such individuals empower and challenge their students to learn.  We often hear media commentary which decries the quality of education but I challenge those who are interested in education to look at the way our examination system expects students to learn by rote in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">All of us agree on the need to consolidate and make government smaller and more centralised in some cases.  The creation of a single body will, I hope, increase efficiency in the Department of Education and Skills and bring a sense of identity to the awarding bodies.  In my experience of adult and continuing education as a director a school in Ballincollig, FETAC was a welcome addition to the education sector because it gave people a sense of purpose as well as a qualification.  That is very important today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">Resources alone will not change the quality of our education system.  We are spending sizeable sums on education and I ask where the money is going.  We must make the education system more agile and responsive to evolving trends worldwide.  If the education system is as bad as some people make it out to be, what is the reason for the amount of foreign direct investment and the quality of postgraduates attracted to this country?  We should identify the areas where the system is deficient and improve them.  Educational providers will find it easier to deal with a single agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The former Minister for Education and Science, Batt O'Keeffe, has called for the National University of Ireland to be abolished but that is not necessarily the correct course of action.  Further debate is needed on this.  We should aim to improve the reputation of our education system both domestically and internationally.  The system should facilitate people in attaining their ambitions.  It is critical that the new body delivers international best practice if we are to attract investment and equip students for the marketplace and the world.  The new body should engage in ongoing consultation with employers when deciding on policy and validation criteria.  Equally, the third level sector must engage with business if it is to ensure the continued relevance of courses and qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">This Bill reflects the Government's commitment to reduce the number of quangos.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has led the way in this regard.  As of last November, we have seen movement by the Government in terms of abolishing and merging quangos and further plans are afoot in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">University College Cork has a strong reputation for professionalism and it has improved its position in the world university ranking system.  It is ranked at 100th position by employers, which is an improvement on its rank last year.  That is a tribute to the way the college is going under the stewardship of Dr. Michael Murphy.  In research, Ireland has moved from 36th in the world to our current position of 20th, a significant jump.  UCC is the only university in Ireland to achieve five-star status.  We have serious issues in our universities but much excellent work is also being done.  It is wrong to paint a picture of this being all negative when much positive work is being done.</p>

        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_434">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1017">I welcome the introduction of this Bill, which will streamline the existing national qualifications and quality assurance bodies and reduce the number of quangos.  The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, and the Further Education and Training Awards Council will amalgamate into a new single national agency, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland.  The authority will provide a more integrated service to learners nationwide in further education, higher education and training.  It will also take responsibility regarding quality assurance reviews of universities to ensure they are providing the highest quality of education.  They will also take over responsibilities that lie with the Irish Universities Quality Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Each of these universities and agencies have successful records and have performed well.  Combined, they will provide increased productivity delivered more efficiently.  The main functions of the new authority will be to set out standards for students to achieve before receiving awards, to review providers to ensure that they are meeting standards of quality and to promote, maintain and further develop the national framework of qualifications.  The body will be responsible for upholding Ireland's strong international reputation for excellence in third level education and to ensure awards are recognised within the framework of qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">The new authority will create a consistent and clear system of quality assurance and qualifications in education and training in Ireland.  It will develop the national framework of qualifications and work with providers to ensure that greater opportunities will be available to learners nationally for participation in high quality training and education.  The framework will be further developed by the new authority, which will later result in more opportunities for learners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">The authority will work closely with the Government to ensure that it is aware of any education and training issues that need to be improved.  Importantly, it will advise the Departments of Education and Skills and Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation on national policy on learning and qualifications and lifelong learning.  It will oversee the implementation of the policy.  It will continue to raise awareness of how qualifications are organised and review the policies and criteria on which the framework is based.  The authority will decide the standards of learning that must be met by the provider before an award is given.  This will strengthen the quality assurance system, which will be of benefit to learners.  This is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">A constituent has been in contact with me to highlight concerns with section 21(2) of the Bill.  The concern is that it may not protect the rights of workers in the new organisation.  I am aware that a number of people have concerns about this and they would like the section to be modified to include all rights of workers in the organisation and not just remuneration.  They would like this section to be changed to include tenure, fees, allowances, expenses and superannuation.  This is something the Minister should take on board and examine in more detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">I support the Bill.  The proposed reduction in the number of quangos is to be welcomed.  Our education system is envied on a worldwide basis and all our universities are in the top 5% in the world.  Many multinationals come to Ireland because of our excellence in education.  We need to continue that and we must not become complacent.  The introduction of the Bill is a step in the right direction to ensure that reputation is protected.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_435">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_1023">I welcome the provisions in the Bill.  My colleague, Deputy Terence Flanagan, listed the range of organisations to be amalgamated, from the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education Training Awards Council.  Apart from streamlining, it also makes sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">I also acknowledge the role of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, in seeking potential synergies on a cross-Border basis.  While there are provisions in the Bill to examine international education codes of practice within the parameters of the National Framework of Qualifications, we should also monitor what is happening on a cross-Border basis.  In 1998, we signed up to the Good Friday Agreement, according to which we must look at linkages and synergy in education on a North-South basis.  It is important to keep an eye on what is happening on the ground.  I welcome the Minister's proactive stance on this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">I suggest the Minister examines what is happening on the ground.  On the same basis that a team may look good on paper to football managers, politicians may think cross-Border ideas look good on paper.  However, it is better to engage with people on the ground who know best practice better than politicians.  One example is the North West Education Action Group, based in County Fermanagh.  It is considering links on a North-South basis at second level.  I spoke to a number of representatives, who are looking back to the practices of 60 and 65 years ago, when many from Belleek, County Fermanagh studied in schools in Ballyshannon.  We must explore the vision and potential that people see on the ground in Border constituencies.  Things will change, particularly given the fact of a Government led by Sinn Féin and the DUP.  The Sinn Féin Minister is in the business of closing down schools, particularly rural primary schools, in Keady and Aghavilly, County Armagh, both of which closed in January.  The minimum threshold at secondary school level is 500 pupils.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_1027">If secondary schools along the Border do not meet the minimum threshold of 500 students, they will also close.  The rationale and philosophy of the Sinn Féin mantra in Northern Ireland is, if I am not mistaken, a form of austerity, which is a word much used in this House.  It is important for us to engage on the ground because we have schools south of the Border that will not be closed.  We have rural primary and secondary schools that we will not close.  We must examine the potential of synergy on a North-South basis, where there will be a movement of people from North to the South to avail of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">If that will happen at primary and secondary level, we must be prepared for what will happen at university level.  It is sad that only 1% of all students in university in the South of Ireland come from Northern Ireland.  That is a small percentage and the corollary is that only 3% of students in Northern Ireland are from the Republic.  It is a poor reflection on the movement of people on a North-South basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">I am digressing from the Bill.  If there are any changes at primary and second level, we must prepare for changes at third level.  Provisions in the Bill examine international codes of practice and should also include examining areas of co-operation on a North-South basis.  Education linkages and synergy are integral to the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">I cite the example of families in my constituency whose children attend Magee University.  They will receive the maintenance grants, but they will have to pay their fees themselves.  We should consider ways of achieving a reciprocal relationship between North and South so that students from the South would be encouraged to study in the North rather than going to Liverpool or Glasgow, for example.  Incentives should be devised to encourage students to study in Ireland, North and South.  I cite an example from my constituency of a father who will have to find €3,000 in fees in order to send his daughter to study 15 miles away in a university in Derry.  People hear the talk about cross-Border co-operation, but they do not see the results on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Primary and second level schools are closing in Northern Ireland.  Two schools closed in Armagh in January.  Secondary schools which do not meet the minimum threshold of 500 students are being closed.  It is time to prepare for the next stage of North-South integration and this must include an integration of university qualifications.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_438">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1032">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011.  Education is a vital part of Irish society and particularly in the current economic climate because education and training will play a significant part in the solution.  Young people and teachers must be protected against the austerity brigade who are in this House and in society.  The current Government policies on education and other areas are generating poverty and undermining a recovery that should be inclusive.  Poverty and education seem to have disappeared from the mainstream political agenda and it is my duty to keep those issues on the agenda.  There needs to be a common-sense response to providing solutions to the problems of this State.  The future depends on education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the amalgamation of a number of education bodies as part of an overall agency rationalisation programme announced by the previous Government in the 2009 budget.  The amalgamation was confirmed in a commitment in the current programme for Government.  The bodies concerned are the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council.  The new organisation will also be responsible for the functions currently performed by the Irish Universities Quality Board which was established by the universities themselves to assure their quality assurance arrangements.  In addition, the Government agreed measures in June 2009 to promote and regulate the international education sector and this is to be welcomed.  Provisions in this Bill are designed to empower the amalgamated organisation to develop an international education marque and code of practice for international education, including the English language sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">Standards in education must be applied from the initial levels of education with the youngest children.  The first day in preschool is a key day for most children and educationalists recognise the importance of a good start in education.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, will be aware of the question of the closure of small rural schools.  Today, I met a group of parents and teachers involved in such schools in the west which are being hammered because of the closure of small rural schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">We had some victories in the campaign for DEIS schools but some of them are suffering the cuts and the squeeze.  I refer to the summer projects which are based in many schools during the summer holidays.  Many teachers and principal teachers have contacted me in recent weeks concerning the reduction in the number of these educational projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">FETAC has played an important role in Irish education.  My experience of FETAC relates to children with a disability and the education system must be designed to support all children with an intellectual disability.  Many children with physical disabilities are provided with a top quality education and are high achievers.  However, we must ensure maximum support for the children and adults with an intellectual disability and FETAC plays a significant role in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">I refer to the problems of literacy.  There have been many positive changes in Irish education over the past decade and in the DEIS schools in particular.  They are examples of good educational practice.  I suggest that many mainstream schools could learn from the system in the DEIS schools because their system is often boring and old-fashioned.  On the other hand, one will see in the disadvantaged schools the use of a radical curriculum as a means of dealing with major literacy and numeracy problems.  Examples of good practice in these DEIS schools could be adapted for use in other so-called wealthier schools which seem to be focused on getting points for university and churning out students who may not have received a proper, rounded education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">There are talented young people in second level education who have great ideas for setting up businesses.  These students may not come out with a certain number of points in their leaving certificate examination but we must realise that they have a contribution to make.  They could be the people who will start a small business and employ five or ten people .  There is a lot of talk and waffle in this House about foreign investment but-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1040">-----most of the workers in this State are employed by small businesses.  The education system, in particular at second level, should be designed to encourage such students.  I know some changes are being implemented and I welcome those positive changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">I fully support rationalisation because there must be efficiencies.  However, I hope the notion of rationalisation is not used as a cover by some of my colleagues in the Labour Party for the cutting of education services.  There is plenty of room for reform and for efficiencies.  We want value for money in the education sector but we cannot drain the blood out of the system, which provides an excellent service to many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">I refer to the potential for the provision of English language education.  We must facilitate international students to come to study here and, in particular, students from China.  I have been in contact with a number of ambassadors who have said they want to send more students to Ireland to learn English.  This is a very important sector.  The Bill sets out the overall structure of the amalgamated organisations and provides for functions in the areas of the maintenance and implementation of the National Framework of Qualifications and external quality assurance of educational providers.  We must ensure that we get quality standards in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">Thousands of young second level students want to get involved in the education sector.  I want to ensure that these educational providers of the future are given maximum support.  I wonder at times whether reducing their salaries will seriously damage the future of the education sector.  We must value education because it represents the potential for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The Bill also deals with the recognition of Irish awards internationally as well as the recognition of foreign awards here.  In addition, the legislation will set standards of access to educational training programmes, as well as the transfer and progression between such programmes.  It also sets standards for awards, validation programmes for educational training, and the regulation of providers of education services to international students.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">There is massive potential to develop the sector's economic value for the State.  In this time of crisis, the State needs as much money as it can get.  Foreign students come here to learn English and other subjects, as well as paying for accommodation and spending money in the economy generally.  All of this makes a great contribution to the economy.  The Government should not close its mind to the options.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">I recently met the Iranian ambassador who was annoyed, upset and disappointed by the closure of the Irish embassy in Teheran.  He said that Iran did approximately €80 million worth of trade with this country.  He also said he wanted to send Iranian students to Dublin to learn English.  The Minister should open his eyes to the potential for such economic and educational developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">The Bill's provisions cover a number of education and training providers such as existing universities and their link providers, including the colleges of education.  Radical changes are needed in our universities and we must all up our game in this regard.  I referred earlier to the urgent need for radical reform in the primary and secondary sectors, but the bottom line is to ensure high standards and good practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">As regards the university sector, we must wake up to the real world and ensure that we have productivity, efficiency and reform.  The Bill also covers the National University of Ireland and its recognised colleges, as well as new universities which can be established under section 9 of the Universities Act 1997, although there are none such at present.  The legislation refers to other providers with awarding powers, including the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">I commend the DIT and other institutes of technology on the major contribution they have made to this country.  Top class students are graduating from those institutes, but we must also be vigilant about maintaining their standards and quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The Bill refers to providers whose programmes are validated by VECs, FÁS and the institutes of technology which have delegated authority to make awards.  Others, including English language providers, have applied to be granted the quality mark provision of education to international learners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">As regards the broader debate on education, we must ensure that stakeholders are protected, guided and reformed in a positive and constructive manner.  We must also be vigilant about working conditions, including pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">A number of Deputies have referred to standards, including those in teacher training colleges.  We should not be afraid to examine this matter because good, solid, basic academic qualifications are required.  We must also ensure that the right people go into the right educational jobs.  People can have many CAO points from their leaving certificate examinations, but it does not necessarily make them good teachers suitable to work with young children in disadvantaged areas.  Teachers must have good communication skills and a positive attitude towards the day job.  It may be old-fashioned to say so, but teaching was always like that for me.  Many years ago, it used to be said that we got a call to training.  At that time it was like winning an All Ireland if one got a call to teacher training.  It was a big honour for a family.  I remember my late father cycling up to the post office saying: "My son got a call to training."  At that time it was a very honourable thing.  As well as getting the academic qualifications, we were hauled into St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra to be interviewed by psychologists and educationalists.  We had to do interviews to see if we would be suitable to work with young children.  We need to be creative about that because the old stuff that went on was very positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">When push came to shove in the recent debate, the Minister saw examples of good practice in many DEIS schools.  They upped their game, increased productivity and were examples of good practice.  Such good practice could be transferred to some of the so-called mainstream or very exclusive schools.  Standards and good practice are very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">We should not be afraid to examine education systems around the world that have high standards.  I know about this from direct experience.  It may not be politically correct to say so at the moment, but when I was in Cuba a couple of years ago I visited primary and secondary schools with top quality standards of service and education.  The Cubans had two things in their revolution which I strongly support - education and health.</p>

          <p eId="para_1060">I am fortunate to represent a city that has two thriving third level colleges - the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and NUI Galway.  Both colleges cater for more than 20,000 students.  As the population of Galway is only approximately 70,000, the student numbers represent an influx during the academic year.  The students completely change the city's dynamic, feel and intellectual atmosphere, including the rigour of debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">The importance, standard and reputation of our education system are extremely important.  I have had much interaction with students from across the country and internationally.  In my constituency office on Monday, I met a doctoral student from Sri Lanka who is studying here.  She is doing her fourth year for a PhD in economics in NUI Galway and has almost completed her studies.  In order to maintain our high level of education we must ensure that the required facilities are in place.  In that way, students who wish to avail of such courses will be looked after properly.  The individual I referred to is having terrible problems with her residency status - her children are staying with her - because her course is running over by a number of months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">In order to maintain that international hub for education, we must offer the correct services to those who come here to contribute to our education system.  In addition, they contribute to learning and to the economy generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">Deputy Finian McGrath and others have said that the importance of the education sector cannot be underestimated.  We have seen a welcome spate of job announcements across the country recently, but particularly located in Galway, I am thankful to say.  All the CEOs, other key decision-makers and people who work in marketing say that people come to work here not just because of our economic climate or tax status, but also because of the educational qualifications of our graduates whose skills can be applied in the workplace.   Ensuring our education system has proper quality standards is important and it will also have  practical knock-on consequences for our economy and country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">There is a great niche market in education for this country if we get the quality standards right and develop a reputation internationally as being a place for scholastic excellence.  This country could then well become an island of scholars - we might have to drop the words "and saints" - to which people can feel free to come and learn.  We could market the country as being one where education is valued, resourced and of high quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The Bill is not quite as grand in its aspirations as those I outlined but it is nonetheless a very welcome development amalgamating, as it does, the various bodies, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, the Higher Education Authority and the quality assurance functions of the universities.  The primary function of the Bill is to bring much greater coherence to the quality assurance system.  It is a timely initiative and I commend the Minister on his dedication to the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">With the enormous increase in participation rates in further and higher education in recent decades and the continuing demand for the provision of courses in many new and emerging disciplines, it is vital that standards are maintained and that quality is not sacrificed or compromised in any way.  This is of great importance to learners who need to navigate their way through a sometimes baffling array of course choice from several providers.  Those learners need to be assured that the programme they chose has been properly vetted and validated and that assessment procedures are fair and appropriate for the level of the course they pursue.  It is also of huge significance to potential employers who need to be able to trust that qualifications are of an appropriate standard and relevance to particular work areas and have been independently and professionally assessed and validated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">The Bill is also of great importance to all those interested in policies that deal with access, with possibilities for transfer of credits from one course or institution to another and for those interested in promoting and developing the future of lifelong learning routes for all our citizens.  Through this Bill it should be possible to enhance the development of clear routes for advancement through the various levels of national qualifications and quality assurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The importance of the Bill also transcends national boundaries and is of enormous significance for the internationalisation agenda of education in this country as it will establish a code of practice for those intending to provide courses for international learners.   By maintaining a register of those authorised to use the international education mark, it will provide for the protection of learners.  For learners educated in this country, it will facilitate the recognition of their awards internationally and, equally importantly, facilitate recognition in this country of appropriate awards gained elsewhere.  All this is very necessary if professional mobility is to be facilitated and promoted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">I would like to add my experience of the quality of education I received at third level.  I graduated from NUI Galway in 2005 with a law degree, an LL.B.  I remember looking back on my time there and thinking how would I rate the quality of the education I received.  I would be very much of the view that the teaching by lecturers and tutors was of a very high standard.  However, I often felt there was somewhat of a conveyor belt attitude in terms of the number of students that could be fitted into an oversized lecture hall to increase the numbers on courses and the standards of checking to monitor how students were doing, whether there were enough assignments or whether examinations tested if one understood law or was simply capable of regurgitating the cases and statutes one was expected to learn and so on.  That was evidenced for me in how the universities across Ireland have been measuring their success to some degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">I recently received an alumni magazine from NUI Galway outlining some of its key achievement in recent years, all of which seem to focus on items that  are more like the achievements of a property developer than an educationist.  There was reference to new buildings for business, engineering and X, Y and Z but very little to the courses it has introduced, the critical thinking it advocates and the new ways it has of measuring performance and student learning, which I would have imagined would be much more important to those who are attending it.  The building in which one learns is important but what and how one is taught, measured and evaluated seems to me to be much more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">Academics have warned, and President Michael D. Higgins spoke of this in his remarks when conferred with an honorary doctorate by the National University of Ireland recently, of the commodification, as some people would see it, of the third level sector in particular.  We no longer view third level as a place where people can be taught to think, to have their own views with regard to arts, the humanities and so on, and apply those creatively to what would be considered the more concrete subjects such as commerce and so on.  In the quality standards they apply, universities must have some way of working in these intangible elements, which are equally as important to an educational environment as the factual and practical outputs such as experiment, project or thesis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">Ireland has much to benefit from having a quality educational reputation.  This Bill goes a long way towards amalgamating many of the fragmented structures we have.  That will save money, which is important, as good housekeeping is very much required at this time for our economy.  It will also provide a means for one central body to have a strategy and a vision Ireland's educational reputation that ensure that we can raise that level over time to become an island of scholars, a place where educational excellence is achieved.  It will at the same time maintain and value that which is not so concrete or measurable, that esoteric thinking, difference of opinion, critical analysis and thinking outside the box that is so important for the creative economy which links into the successful and real economy we have.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
          <p eId="para_1073">As Deputy Nolan said, despite the undoubtedly huge challenges we have economically, the level and quality of education at all levels remains high.  The challenge is to protect and enhance it and in particular to protect, enhance and add to, as best we can, investment in education at all levels.  As the months and years go by in this protracted economic crisis not only here, but worldwide, increasing numbers of people realise how essential it is that governments concentrate their efforts on investment in the future, on investment in education and training.  Despite the enormous challenges the Government faces, it should be congratulated on substantially maintaining an investment in and a commitment to education at all levels.  If people were to examine the economic situation in which we are in and the financial challenges we face, it would surprise many of them that we have still managed, for example, to bring forward an impressive school building programme, which is under preparation for implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">We are concerned in this debate with third level education, the importance of standards and of having an integrated system of standards and quality assurance in third level education.  This is an important Bill in that regard.  Essentially, it does not appear - the Minister can correct me if I am wrong - to change the basic policy formulation in regard to how standards are to be maintained and assured but it will amalgamate the four bodies that previously were responsible for the different sectors into one.  I made a point recently in regard to another area where an amalgamation of agencies was taking place.  It is vitally important that when we are doing this we understand the rationale for doing it.  We should have an expectation that the rationale would extend beyond simply financial savings, important as that is.  Anything we can do to save costs is vital and it is important we should do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">However, as legislators, we should also be looking to see is there a rationale in substance for making the policy change or implementing the changes proposed.  There is in this case.  It has been well set out by the Minister and it is clear.  In 1999, when the systems for evaluating quality were brought forward in the various sectors, they had a job to do and they have done it admirably.  It appears to make sense that the respective expertise they have built up in the different areas could be more appropriately done through one agency which can bring all the various areas under the one roof when it comes to the narrow area of standards and their assessment.  The same instruments will not be appropriate to assess all of them, but we should have an integrated system which we can understand and in which we can have public confidence that the same standard is applied to the assessment of standards.  I may have phrased this in a very convoluted way.  This is what the Bill does and it is important that it should do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">It is admirable in the current environment that the Government has maintained a very considerable commitment to third level education and the Minister has been very clear that we will continue to maintain it.  There is a crisis, or certainly a real difficulty, in the third level sector in respect of the source of funding.  It is a labour-intensive business and it is vital that we enhance standards and provide opportunities for young people.  We invest in them as individuals, but through them we invest in the future of the country.  We have previously debated third level fees and it is extremely important that we maintain our position on the funding of education being a public good.  Often this debate is not as elaborated as much as it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">Certain things in society are worth funding as public goods.  Of course some of the benefits attach to the individuals who gain a third level education, but for the type of society we want to promote we must pool our resources through taxation and in respect of third level education make it available to those who merit availing of it.  There is no controversy about whether second level education and primary education should be public goods funded by the Exchequer.  I believe third level education is a similar public good and worthy of protection and funding.  This does not make life any easier for the Minister or the Government when it comes to judging from where the funding will come and whether there needs to be a better public debate about Exchequer funding of third and fourth level education.  If it is as vital as we believe it is for the future of the country, with investment being so important, perhaps we should sponsor a higher level of debate on the issue and the desirability and importance of funding third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">I made a point on having the various sectors under one roof for the purpose of qualifications and quality assurance.  There has long been a debate on the dichotomy between university education and the technical and vocational sectors.  It is right they should be drawn together in the Bill.  However, further debate is necessary on the future direction of third level education, where we allocate resources and which areas we privilege for resources.  If we compare ourselves to some of our competitors in Europe, we see they are far more advanced and far better at promoting technical education, educational skills and training than we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">Even public attitudes towards the various types of third level education differ.  There is a sense in people's minds that university education is privileged when it is compared to technical and vocational education.  This is a pity when we consider the type of skills that will be necessary in the future.  I do not state this to disagree with what Deputy Nolan stated about the importance of fostering the humanities and ensuring people who come out of third level education are well-rounded individuals with an appreciation of the value of education.  However, it is important to examine whether our third level education system might give more attention to the technical side than it has done up to now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">In recent days I read a proposal from an advanced policy maker in this area to move medical and law schools from the universities into the vocational sector.  I cannot see this happening any time soon here or in any comparable country but it makes one pause to consider the technical and scientific skills associated with the study of medicine.  Must the study of medicine be located in a university in the traditional sense we understand it?  I am using this example as a way of identifying the issue rather than advocating that we do so, although it reminds me of a related point.  When we discuss reducing costs and rationalising the third level system as best we can we must consider whether we need the number of medical and law schools we have in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">The Minister has been very progressive with regard to the primary school sector.  Several months ago I discussed with him the sharing of services between schools in a provincial town where, for instance, one school has a gym and another has another well developed facility.  Of course these facilities should be shared.  I am aware similar opportunities have been availed of in the third level sector but given the size of the country and our cities, opportunities for synergies and shared facilities must exist.  Those of us with exposure to the third level system, whether having been there or knowing people there now, know how patches are protected and how people are reluctant to give way to sharing facilities or, dare I say it, merging departments or academic facilities.  I would have no difficulty if the Minister were to say he would consider this.  For these reasons the Bill is worthy of our support.  It is a clear and desirable measure and its rationale has been clearly set out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">I wish to ask the Minister about the transfer of staff to the new authority, an issue which other speakers have also mentioned and I believe the Minister has addressed it.  What I find very striking is that in regard to the previous transfer from the old bodies such An Foras, CERT and Teageasc, section 52 of the 1999 Act brought forward all rights and entitlements and not only pay.  A policy decision must have been made to confine the benefits to pay in this case.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patrick Nulty</from>
          <p eId="para_1085">I welcome the establishment of the new authority and I commend the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on introducing the Bill.  This debate on its establishment provides an opportunity to make some points on governance and standards in training, education and qualifications in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">I want to reflect on university life in Ireland and I agree with some of the points made by my colleague, Deputy Nolan, on the commercialisation of education.  Neoliberal thought has strengthened its impact on thinking in Ireland in the body politic and in universities.  The definition of the appropriate function of a university in Irish life has narrowed greatly.  Great universities need great teachers.  Teaching in universities needs to be valued in and of itself, but too often the modern university is less a marketplace of ideas with good teachers facilitating students in a journey of exploration and learning and more a knowledge factory.  It is not good enough to conceptualise education in purely managerial or technical terms like so many heads of our universities seem to do.  I listen with regret when I hear the heads of our universities speak more like chief executives of companies than leaders of centres of learning and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">More often than not, they speak not of the good of the society, nor of the good of students, but often in terms of what is good only for the university itself and its commercial operation when its <i>modus operandi</i> should be educational excellence and the development of political, moral, philosophical and scientific thought in Ireland and beyond our shores.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">Many good courses in our universities have fallen foul of the neoliberal model.  I am concerned that courses, which facilitate people to develop the capacity to think and reflect critically about themselves and the society in which they live, may not fall into a narrow concept of third level education in years to come.  It is essential that we foster opportunities for education in maths, science and technology to attract investment leading to jobs.  It is equally important to foster the teaching of philosophy, sociology, social policy, the arts and humanities so that all those in the third level sector can think critically and question the powerful in our society about the foundations on which our society is organised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">The new body we are establishing must have concern for the role of education in society.  It must consider universities and other third level institutions as thriving centres for ideas.  Research and teaching must not be in competition with each other, but must exist alongside each other in a thriving third level sector working towards the common good.  In that context I welcome that the Union of Students in Ireland has today voted for a third level education model funded fully through the Exchequer - a model that I support.  Income tax should be increased on annual incomes of €80,000 or more to help pay for universal access to third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">The new body must ensure that the role of teaching in our universities is valued.  It must advertise itself as open for business to those students who wish to consult with it in regard to the quality of teaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The new body will absorb the functions of FETAC.  It is essential that our new regulatory structure recognises that the adult learners and those returning to education who form the bulk of those on FETAC-approved courses deserve the very best in excellence of teaching.  The learners also require that approved education providers for adults and those returning to education will ensure that qualifications are fully respected when courses are complete.  The new body must be promoted so that every adult learner and everybody returning to education knows the organisation has been established and has the responsibility, should problems ever arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">Of the functions currently under the auspices of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, it is the issue of the regulation of English language schools that concerns me most.  The schools are currently regulated by ACELS, the Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services.  I have profound concerns about the treatment of staff in language schools in Ireland.  I know of no English language school operating in Dublin where a trade union is recognised.  I know of no other industry where work is so insecure or precarious that one never hears of contracts, rarely of sick pay or paid leave.  I hope the new authority will investigate that and that the Minister in his role will also look at the issues.  The Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland we are establishing today must take on board the conditions experienced by workers in language schools if they are to take seriously education standards in these schools.  Teachers must feel secure and enjoy decent terms and conditions in order to concentrate on the educational development of their students and to facilitate the sort of learning those coming to Ireland to learn English should experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The Higher Education and Training Awards Council is the other body that will be amalgamated into this umbrella organisation when the Bill is passed.  It is the qualifications awarding body for third level education and training institutions outside the university sector.  In that context I pay tribute to our institutes of technology.  In my constituency, Dublin West, the IT in Blanchardstown has performed incredibly well.  Students from some of our DEIS schools, such as Riversdale community college, are going in droves to these institutes of technology, representing a major step forward in the educational mix.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">While I support the organisations that have been set up, they have a number of challenges, in the English language sector, the university sector and the tertiary sector.  I hope this body will be cognisant of them all.  I am very concerned about the commercialisation not only of third level education, but also of research in our universities.  It is vital that when new ideas and products are developed within our university sector they are fostered and advanced by indigenous companies perhaps on a co-operative basis.  That research should be democratically developed and controlled so that large multinational corporations - while they have a role to play - do not have monopoly in new research and development in our educational sector.  While I would not discourage in any way private sector investment, particularly if it is good for the students, we must remember that first and foremost education is a social product and a social good.  The courses, options and opportunities offered to students at third and fourth level should be diverse open and dictated by the educational needs of the country and our society and not by the commercial interests of the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">I support the Bill and I commend the Minister on introducing it.  I hope some of the points I have made today will be taken on board and that we build an education system based on universal provision funded through direct taxation, democratically controlled and in the interests of society and not for narrow commercial interests.  I wish the Minister well in his challenging role.</p>

          <p eId="para_1096">The Bill is a positive instrument of change in that it addresses a prevailing situation whereby awards are being issued by different authorities with an obvious overlap occurring.  The new authority will inject clarity into the awards process, while at the same time offering a more cost-effective awards authority.  While NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and the IUQB were all excellent authorities and performed and served the nation well, the new QQAAI will offer the opportunity to amalgamate the services of all these bodies in order to deliver an improved, more focused and more cost-effective service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">The new body is charged with maintaining the NFQ and introducing more clarity on the organisation of qualifications.  Being a single body it will be better placed to monitor and review policies regarding the NFQ and manage the access to courses, inter-course transfers and the progression of students through the system.  It will also be better placed to advise the Departments of Education and Skills, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on national policies on qualifications and the directions required for national policies on the certification of lifelong learning, which is an important new development in the education field and more important than ever now in the present climate, where the necessity for further education, retraining and re-employment has become a major issue for the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">This new body will be able to advise both Departments on national policy regarding the accumulation and the transfer of credit and the recognition of prior learning, both here and internationally, which will become a greater issue when, hopefully, the young people who left these shores to find employment and further education, return.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">The authority will set quality standards and procedures to apply across the universities of the NUI and will decide the standards of learning to be met in order to achieve an award.  A single organisation must be more efficient than a number of organisations trying to provide one service and now is certainly the right time to establish the QQAAI.  However, in doing so we must be aware that the amalgamation is a difficult process.  I wish the IAG every success in undertaking this difficult task, which when completed will provide benefits, including a leaner, more agile and more responsive agency which will be better positioned to keep pace with international best practice.  It will be more accessible and simpler to deal with for education and training providers.  It will enhance the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ, providing clarity for students and award holders and, in doing so, will enhance Ireland's provision of education and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">In conclusion, there will be added benefit to those in our economy who are developing Ireland's reputation as a high quality provider of educational services, an area of great growth potential at this time when such was never as badly needed.  They will benefit from the international education mark and code of practice, which will introduce a greater degree of strategic planning and implementation among all participating in the development of education services in this country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</from>
          <p eId="para_1101">I thank the Technical Group for allocating this time for my contribution and I acknowledge the presence of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">The ideology behind this Bill, that it would be more efficient to have a single organisation to ensure quality in further and higher education and training rather than the current system which involves several bodies, some of them with overlapping responsibilities, is broadly welcome.  However, I take exception to a statement made earlier in the debate when a Deputy said he was delighted that the Government was finally doing away with quangos and bringing many different organisations under a single umbrella.  Whether we are talking about the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland or the Irish Universities Quality Board, the people who served on those boards over the years would not be too pleased to hear a Deputy in the Dáil refer to the committees and boards they sat on, perhaps for many years, in that way.  They gave good service, did good work and did their best at all times.  It is wrong for a Member of this House to dismiss other organisations as quangos.  I do not like it and wish to voice my opposition to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The Bill sets out the overall structure of the amalgamated organisation and provides for its functions in the area of the maintenance and implementation of the National Framework of Qualifications, the external quality assurance of educational providers, the accreditation and recognition of prior learning, the recognition of Irish awards internationally and the recognition of international awards in Ireland, the setting of standards for access to programmes of education and training and the transfer and progression between programmes, the setting of standards for awards, the making of awards, the validation of programmes of education and training, and the regulation of providers of educational services to international students.  The new organisation will also take on responsibility for the external quality assurance review of the universities, a function that is currently performed by the Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB, and the Higher Education Authority.  There will also be a discussion with the National University of Ireland, NUI, about the possibility of including some of the related functions of the NUI in the new organisation.  That would be very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">The Bill provides in legislation for the first time for the external review of the quality assurance procedures of universities and the transfer of this function from the IUQB to the new agency.  Recognised universities of the NUI establishing quality assurance procedures will have those procedures approved under the new agency.  This follows the report which showed a very worrying slippage by three Irish universities in the world rankings.  Trinity College Dublin is down 13 places and UCD is down 20 places, while NUI Galway is down 66 places.  UCC climbed three places.  In the past, Ireland had an excellent reputation both at home and internationally for the standard of education and standards in the universities.  Overseas employers who came to this country to create much needed jobs considered our education system to be a model that turned out excellent, highly educated and articulate young people.  It was very much an added attraction for companies coming to this country.  The slippage in the rankings is something that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">The Minister is in tune with that problem and is anxious that we go back to the position we held in the past.  We do not want a situation where people who are considering coming to this country to create jobs will bring their own graduates with them.  We welcome everybody, of course, but we wish to see our indigenous young population getting jobs here after receiving a good education.  Whether our young people who finish university decide to stay and get jobs in Ireland or they must unfortunately go abroad, we must ensure they go with the best education possible and having been given every opportunity in this country.  When they travel around the world, therefore, they will have the same standard, or better, as applies in whatever part of the world they decide to stay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">The Department claims that the amalgamation will save the Exchequer an estimated €1 million per annum, but there will be extra costs for providers of education to international students and there might be extra costs for providers who must comply with the provisions of the NFQ.  However, there might be some savings for providers who currently deal with both FETAC and HETAC.  Of course, any savings that might be made would be very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">We had a good reputation in the past with regard to foreign students coming to study in this country, whether in our universities or in our schools.  Parents from all over Europe were very glad to send their children to Ireland.  They saw Ireland as a welcoming country and a place where their children would not only get a good education but also enjoy the hospitality which we were able to provide in a way, perhaps, that no other country in the world could provide.  Overall, the students who came here were safe, secure and happy.  When they left after completing their education, they were good roving ambassadors for this country around the world because they could refer to the good aspects of the education and hospitality they received in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">I welcome the work that has been done on setting up this organisation.  However, I am mindful of a meeting we had today with representatives who were concerned about saving our small national schools.  Education starts from the first day a child leaves home at four or five years of age to go to the local national school.  The point is that we want our young people to attend their local national school.  From the first day of their education it is important that young people start on the right foot.  In the past, we had one of the best systems in the world in that we had small national schools in rural areas that gave young students a very special and sincere start in education, which put them on a path to being sound, grounded individuals.  It prepared them for going to secondary school and on to university and then into the workforce for the rest of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">I am not taking pop at the Minister about education cuts or some of the views he has about small schools, but I am taking this opportunity to plead with him.  I have spoken about this before and I am sorry if I am repeating myself, but it is something in which I have a very strong belief.  The people we met today are working in small schools and, thankfully, the current and past Governments have invested in those schools.  If we abandon those schools, we will not save any money.  The teachers are there anyway.  If a school is crumbling and falling down and it would require hundreds of thousands of euro to rebuild it for only a handful of students, I would be the first to agree that the sensible to do is to let that school go or amalgamate it.  However, in the case of a school with every facility, on which a fortune has been spent over the past five, ten or 15 years and in which a nice system operates, it would be shameful to walk away from such buildings.  I acknowledge the Minister has not stated he wishes to close schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_1123">-----because I am starting off at the very beginning and am talking about the need to ground students and give them every advantage in their educational life.  I revert to the point I made, which is money will not be saved by amalgamating schools.  The buildings will not be sold as purchasers for them are lacking.  However, they will not be abandoned and as heat and light will still be provided, the standing bills will continue.  Moreover, as the teachers will continue to teach in the amalgamated schools, I see no reason to go down that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">I return full circle to the reason I began to speak about small schools, which is my belief that over the years, successive Governments have given proper attention and concern in this regard.  There have been great Ministers for Education over the years.  As a young person, I remember travelling to by-elections and encountering the late John Wilson.  He was a terribly nice man who was really caring in his role, just as is the Minister.  We have been fortunate in the Ministers who have served in this capacity over the years and my hope is for the maintenance of the high level and standards we have enjoyed heretofore.  This is the reason the results showing a slippage in the rankings of the three universities is of great concern.  In passing this Bill and ensuring the establishment of this umbrella organisation that will bring together the other organisations, I hope that by working collectively, not only can further slippage be avoided but the exact opposite will take place and we will rise again.  Excellent people work in the universities and throughout the education system and I can see no reason that would prevent Ireland from climbing back up the world rankings to its previous position and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">I look forward to going further into the issue of smaller schools at another time.  I hope the issue will be debated again in the Chamber before the summer recess because it is of vital importance.  As for ensuring that Ireland remains attractive as a place to study, I refer to the example of Galway, a place with which the Minister is familiar.  Given the number of foreign students who study there and the associated economic boost, one certainly does not wish to see a fall in standards or in the number of those who wish to come here to receive an excellent education.  I thank the Minister and the Ceann Comhairle.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Skills  (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
          <p eId="para_1126">I thank Deputy Healy-Rae for his comments.  The debate on smaller schools will take place when the value for money report, which will be out in a matter of weeks, is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">As for the Bill that is concluding its Second Stage debate, I thank the Deputies for all the contributions made.  In particular, I pay tribute to Deputy Smith on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and Deputy McClellan on behalf of Sinn Féin, as well as the group of speakers who spoke on behalf of the Technical Group.  Some concerns have been expressed regarding the reason, in a departure from the original intentions, the NUI has been brought back into the picture.  I am glad there is support for this move and it is because when in opposition, I challenged the wisdom of eliminating a recognised brand with a long history, having been established in 1908, while at the same time trying to develop Ireland internationally as a place where students would come and study.  It is envisaged they would do so in colleges here or alternatively in colleges of an Irish origination associated with or linked to the National University of Ireland located in other parts of the world.  Co-location, either in the Middle East or in China with colleges in those countries or regions and either the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland or the NUI, is part of a new departure in which it is hoped to implement the programme for Government's objective of doubling the participation of international students in the Irish system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">Deputy Clare Daly and others, including Deputy White, expressed some concern about the manner in which the text could be read, which would suggest that working conditions would be diminished or downgraded.  The concern is that although they are not precisely the phrases used, this was the intent and such conditions as currently are held by workers in the four bodies to be amalgamated somehow would be diminished.  I assure Members this was not the Bill's intent, which is to ensure the harmonisation of working practices across the four situations.  For example, different leave arrangements and different arrangements regarding replacements, lunchtimes and all sorts of other matters were in place.  While this concerns fewer than 50 people in total, in the future the same people will be working together in the same office.  Currently there are two office locations that will be side-by-side and the intention is to enable management to harmonise and to improve the efficiency of work practices, as distinct from undermining or in any way diminishing the working protection and working conditions in respect of salary, pension rights and related matters.  I wish to assure Members in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">I have listened to Deputy Nolan's comments with regard to education in Galway and the fact that Galway city is a major provider of education with its two major institutions, namely, GMIT and NUI Galway.  I was not fully aware of the extent to which the population of Galway comprised 20,000 students during the academic year in a city with a total population of 70,000 people.  It truly must be the most academic city in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">A number of Members voiced concerns regarding the position of Irish universities in the various rankings and I will revert to this issue on Committee Stage.  The rankings measure a number of indicators and in some cases are self-predicting.  One can take a number of metrics and apply them to a set of universities whereby one consequently can predict the outcomes.  For example, the Shanghai index, which was the first index to be used worldwide, was designed by the Chinese Government to measure the effectiveness and comparability of Chinese university standards when benchmarked against universities in the United States.  In particular, its compilers considered the ratio of research money to outputs, as well as the quality of the research staff and teaching staff with reference, for example, to the numbers of Nobel prizewinners one might have on the staff.  Consequently, one can take a set of criteria, apply it to a landscape of institutions, knowing those institutions are heavily weighted in favour of the criteria one has put up on the measurements board in the first instance, and get a favourable outcome.  However, what none of the rankings do to my satisfaction is to measure the quality of teaching.  For most parents and students, the quality of teaching is as important for them as is the research activity, which in many respects will not have an impact on the quality of the teaching that affects the qualifications and academic standards they will have achieved on emerging from that university.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">The Irish State will take on the Presidency of the European Union starting in January 2013 and as Minister for Education and Skills, I will take up the role of incoming President of the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council.  As such, I have informed my colleagues and officials on the Educational Council, including the Commissioner for Education and Related Matters, of my intention to advance the European proposal to introduce a ranking system entitled "multi-rank", which will measure on a European level not alone European universities, but universities in those countries prepared to associate within the Bologna process, which if my memory serves me correctly now encompasses approximately 46 member states.  I recently attended a conference at which this matter was discussed at length.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">I thank Members for their contributions.  We will address the matters that have been raised in detail on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_1136">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">I am pleased to bring the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2012 before the Dáil today.  The Bill is required to legislatively underpin any new or existing body established under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971 to 2012, if amended, and to facilitate the Department's agency rationalisation programme by allowing the Minister to dissolve, re-organise and merge State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">Before referring to the Bill in detail, I would like to provide some background information concerning the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, the purpose of which was to enable the Minister to establish by order corporate bodies to provide to local authorities or to the Minister such services as are specified in the establishment orders.  The Act was framed in general terms so that the powers it conferred could if deemed necessary or desirable be used to establish bodies to provide other services for local authorities.  It remains the case that the Minister should, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, have the capability to establish bodies to provide services to local authorities for a specific purpose and where it is more practical, efficient and economical to provide such service through a single body rather than have each of the 34 major local authorities acting separately at much greater cost.  This approach is in keeping with the programme for Government commitment to make substantial cuts to the number of State bodies and companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">Seven of the 13 bodies established under the 1971 Act still exist in law, namely, the Limerick Northside Regeneration Agency, the Limerick Southside Regeneration Agency, the Local Government Management Services Board, the Local Government Computer Services Board, the Affordable Homes Partnership, Irish Water Safety and the Fire Safety Council.  Generally, these bodies were established to provide specified services for local authorities with the benefit of having a single expert provider rather than each local authority acquiring or providing the service.  For instance, Irish Water Safety has provided water safety advice and water safety inspections to individual local authorities who did not have this specialist knowledge at hand.  The Local Government Management Services Board provides shared industrial relations advice and representation services to local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">Members may recall that in 2008 the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) (Amendment) Bill was enacted.  This legislation was required to address the possible unconstitutionality of section 3 of the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971.  This followed advice of the Attorney General on the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961 and the subsequent passing of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007 by both Houses of the Oireachtas in December 2007.  The Attorney General advised that the possible unconstitutionality of section 3 of the Act of 1961 in terms of health related bodies also extended to local government bodies established under section 3 of the 1971 Act.  This arose as the 1971 Act contains similar provisions to those found in the 1961 Act.  The 2008 Act confirmed the various establishment orders made for existing corporate bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">Article 15.2 of Bunreacht na hÉireann explicitly confers on the Oireachtas the "sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State".  In various constitutional challenges over the years concerning whether secondary legislation infringed Article 15.2 of the Constitution, the need for the Government to have a mechanism to establish corporate bodies has been recognised in judgments of the High Court and Supreme Court.  In his judgment in the Pigs and Marketing Board <i>v.</i>  Donnelly, Hanna J. it his acknowledged that “the functions of every Government are now so numerous and complex that of necessity a wider sphere has been recognised for subordinate agencies, such as boards and commissions”.  However, as  was stated by the then Chief Justice in the judgment in the Cityview Press case, the test of the constitutionality of the legal instrument establishing corporate bodies is that it gives “effect to principles and policies which are contained in the statute itself”.  O’Higgins C.J. laid down the test to be applied in the case of <i>Cityview Press v AnCo </i>when he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1142">The giving of powers to a designated Minister or subordinate body to make regulations or orders under a particular statute has been a feature of legislation for many years.  The practice has obvious attractions in view of the complex, intricate and ever changing situations which confront both the Legislature and the Executive in a modern State ..... The ultimate responsibility rests with the Courts to ensure the constitutional safeguards remain, and that the exclusive authority of the National Parliament in the field of law-making is not eroded by a delegation of power which is neither contemplated nor permitted by the Constitution.  In discharging that responsibility, the courts will have regard to where and by what authority the law in question purports to have been made.  In the view of this Court, the test is whether that which is challenged as an unauthorised delegation of parliamentary power is more than a mere giving effect to principles and policies which are contained in the statute itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">This Bill is required, <i>inter alia</i>, to address the legal uncertainty surrounding bodies established under the 1971 Act.  The difficulties with the 1971 Act arose as a result of a possible disconnect between the powers conveyed on the Minister to establish bodies under and the clear principles and policies contained in the 1971 Act to guide the Minister in that regard.  The intention behind the amendments contained in this Bill in respect of section 3 of the 1971 Act is to set out the principles and policies, in primary legislation, which the Minister shall have regard to in his consideration of the requirement to establish any bodies by way of statutory instrument.It is important to note that the Bill is not being pursued in order for the Minister to increase the number of State bodies under the Departments aegis.  On the contrary, it is required  to give full effect to the Department’s State agency rationalisation programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">This Bill is intended to facilitate better management of the bodies and activities included in the Bill to allow the Minister, by order, to provide for the organisation and functions of the bodies individually and collectively as may be necessary in the context of tighter funding allocations and achieving greater efficiencies.  This is in keeping with the Government's public sector reform plan announced on 17 November 2011.  The plan announced an expanded programme of State agency rationalisation within the Department, which will rationalise 21 such bodies into 12.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The seven remaining bodies established under the 1971 Act will be dissolved, merged or subsumed into other public bodies as part of the rationalisation programme.  In this regard, the Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board are already merged in an operational sense and now operate on a joint administrative basis pending the establishment of the merged body, namely, the Local Government Management Agency, on a statutory basis.  The Local Government Computer Services Board and the Local Government Management Services Board provide services to local authorities, including, ICT applications development and support, ICT research, ICT hosting services, enhanced network services, collection of public-facing charges on a shared basis for local authorities, human resource best practice, industrial relations advice and professional representation, research and policy and procurement.  These services have continued to be provided by the new Local Government Management Agency.  This Bill will give the agency the required statutory footing.  The Local Government Management Agency will also take on residual functions from An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.  Under this Bill, An Chomhairle will be dissolved as part of the Department's agency rationalisation programme.  I will discuss An Chomhairle in greater detail later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">The Affordable Homes Partnership will be dissolved and its functions, as well as those of the Centre for Housing Research and the National Building Agency, have been merged into the Interim Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, IHSCA.  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency is currently operating on an administrative basis and will be given statutory underpinning through this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">The Affordable Homes Partnership was established in 2005 to co-ordinate and promote the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area.  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency works with the Department and with local authorities and approved housing bodies in the delivery of housing and housing services.  The agency brings together under one body a broad range of support and advisory services in respect of housing and other construction-related matters.  While this Bill allows for the establishment of the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, further and more complex legislation will be required to define its roles and functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">The Fire Services Council was established in June 1983 and provided a central training programme for local authority fire service officers, providing courses and seminars that complemented training organised locally by individual fire authorities.  The council's term of office expired on 30 June 2009 and no new appointments were made to it after that date.  The Minister did not re-appoint the council and announced that its work would be absorbed into the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management.  The national directorate was established on 22 June 2009.  It operates under the aegis of the local government division of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  The mandate of the national directorate is to create an effective model of integrated leadership, development support and oversight by central Government of local authority's provision of consistently effective, safe, and value-for-money fire and emergency services in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">The national directorate is a tripartite structure with a management board, a consultative committee and the fire services and emergency management section of the Department.  The three components operate as interdependent elements of a functioning national directorate.  The management board provides for integration of different strands of service management.  It will propose priorities, support policy-making and oversee consistent implementation of the nationally determined priorities and policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">The consultative committee provides a forum for representation of and consultation with stakeholder interests.  The directorate is headed by a national director and is structured around four core business units: an emergency management-civil protection team; a fire safety and development team; an administration team; and a fire service operations team.  The establishment of the national directorate was in keeping with the desire to reduce the number of agencies while providing appropriate political accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">The Limerick Regeneration agencies were established in June 2007, with a term of operation for five years, to 14 June 2012.  The agencies were established to secure the social and economic regeneration of four areas of Limerick city.  This Bill will dissolve the two regeneration agencies whose functions will be taken over by the new office for regeneration which has been established in Limerick city.  A new interim director for regeneration has been appointed to oversee the transition of functions from the Limerick Regeneration agencies and Limerick City Council and to progress the implementation plans and projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">The Government decided on 28 June 2011 to establish a single new Limerick local authority to replace the existing city and county councils, with effect from the 2014 local elections.  It also approved the implementation of dual management arrangements, whereby the same person would act as manager for Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council in the period leading up to the full merger, at which point the same person would become the manager for the new unified authority.  The post of manager was advertised recently.  The regeneration office has initially been set up with administrative support from Limerick City Council but will report directly to the manager designate of the new unitary authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Irish Water Safety is relatively small, with a staff of six, but there is a large amount of volunteerism in the area of water safety.  Its role is to educate people in water safety best practices.  It develops public awareness campaigns to promote necessary attitudes, rescue skills and behaviour to prevent drownings and water-related accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">I realise I am short of time, a Cheann Comhairle, but will refer briefly to An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.  The Bill does not only deal with agency rationalisation in respect of bodies established under the Local Government (Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, but also deals with the dissolution of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, the Library Council, which was established by the Public Libraries Act 1947.  The functions of the council, as set out in section 79 of the Local Government Act 2001, include a number of functions I will not read into the record because of the shortage of time.  In addition, in 2008, An Chomhairle Leabharlanna was given statutory responsibility for the operation of the public lending remuneration scheme under the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Act, 2007<i>.</i>  As part of the Department’s rationalisation programme, An Chomhairle Leabharlanna will be dissolved, with some residual functions transferring to the local government management agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">As can be seen, the Bill will facilitate very significant mergers of State bodies under the Department's aegis.  The Local Government Management Agency will not only amalgamate the Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board, but will also amalgamate the residual functions of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.</p>

          <p eId="para_1157">I will refer briefly to the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 contains the usual provisions while sections 2 and 3 are standard technical provisions.  Although no direct expenditure in implementing the Act is anticipated, it is prudent to include these standard provisions.  Section 4 is an amendment of section 2 of the Act of 1971 and deletes the reference to "health board" as an authority to which this Act applies.  Section 5 inserts an important amendment to section 3 of the 1971 Act to deal with the link between the policies and principles of primary legislation with bodies established by statutory instrument under the 1971 Act.  Section 3 provided for "the Establishment of bodies to provide certain services".  This reference to the services a body can provide is too vague and more clarity is required.  The Minister will still be able to establish bodies, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to assist him in his functions, or the local authorities in their functions, similar to the 1971 Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_1160">That is fine.  I will conclude, going through to section 12.  I will refer briefly to the amendments I will introduce tomorrow.  These will enable dual management arrangements to operate in Limerick and Tipperary and will specifically allow for the appointment of a single manager to both sets of authorities, pending their full merger in 2014.  This will ensure there is clear and cohesive leadership of the reorganisation process in both areas.  In this context, I am examining the findings of the local government committee in respect of arrangements in Waterford.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, will report to Government on the matter as soon as he has completed these deliberations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">The wider local government reform proposals the Minister will bring to Government shortly will reflect other work in progress in regard to various aspects of local government, including the merger and restructuring processes to which I have referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">In addition to the amendments before the House, more substantive legislation will be required to implement the merger of the two authorities in both counties, the establishment of new unitary authorities and the transfer of functions, assets, liabilities, staff, etc., from the existing councils to the successor authorities.  The wider policy proposals to which I referred may also give rise to the need for legislation depending on the final shape of those proposals and decisions taken by Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1167">I thank the Minister of State for her very informative opening statement in regard to what is contained in the Bill.  I read the explanatory memorandum at the outset and the way it was written was quite technical.  However, the Minister of State has explained it succinctly, in layperson's terminology.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">My party will support the main thrust of the Bill because it is a set of housekeeping measures that are badly required.  One of the issues that struck me when I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts in the previous Dáil was the number of agencies and sub-agencies within local authorities right across the public sector.  They are more commonly known as quangos.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">There is such a long way to go with local government reform and there must be a starting point somewhere.  In her contribution, the Minister of State mentioned the local government efficiency review which was published in July 2010.  I have it to hand and was looking at it earlier today.  It cited 106 recommendations, culminating in savings of approximately €511 million.  There is a great deal of implementation to be done to address the substantive recommendations in the report.  We could do with a further debate in regard to the timeline for the delivery of many of the report's recommendations.  I know a group is sitting to work on the implementation of the recommendations.  It would be nice to hear how it is getting on with its task and what type of timeline it envisages for the achievement or delivery of many of the good recommendations in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">I would like to address some of the specific issues that are dealt with in the Bill before the House.  We do not have any particular concerns about them.  Some of the bodies to be abolished served useful purposes at certain points in time and made valuable contributions to the country and to society over the years.  I refer particularly to Irish Water Safety and An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.  As practising constituency representatives, we all come across the issue of libraries from time to time.  Libraries make a significant contribution to all sections of society.  It is important to emphasise that although An Chomhairle Leabharlanna is being abolished, the merit that is to be garnered from the functions of the library service is not being diminished or diluted in any way.  When I speak to people associated with the delivery of the library service in my part of the country, they tell me there has been a significant increase in the number of users of that service, particularly during the recent times the country has been going through.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">I wish to speak about some of the bigger-ticket items that are contained in this legislation.  The Minister of State mentioned the two Limerick Regeneration agencies.  We will probably hear more about them when we debate the amalgamation of the two local authorities in County Limerick.  It is fair to say that the two agencies have had a relatively chequered history as they have delivered their remit over the last five years.  It is good that they will be subsumed into the new local authority in Limerick.  The decisions that are taken by the two regeneration agencies, which have such vast potential, budgets and implications for society and for societal issues in Limerick city and the greater Limerick area, affect areas of County Limerick, north Tipperary and County Clare.  It is right that the two agencies will be more directly responsible to the new unitary authority that is proposed to come into being after the 2014 local elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">On the issue of holding people to account, it is important for our directly elected local public representatives to have more responsibility and more of a direct say.  A feature of the establishment of detached State agencies in the local government sector and elsewhere in the public service is that they have largely become unaccountable to public representatives.  That has led to a diminution in the role and responsibilities of public representatives, which is not a good thing.  If local government reform is to have real and meaningful effect, the role of the public representative has to be enhanced.  The powers, the decision-making functions and the collective authority of the members of a council should be enhanced.  We need to have a real debate on the financing of local government.  We might differ on the application of the Government's water agenda, the levying of the household charge and the potential for property taxes, but we should agree that if there is to be real and meaningful local government reform, we need to consider allowing local authorities to spend those revenues that are generated and collected in their areas.  Ultimately, we will have to consider giving local authorities the power to strike their own water and property rates, similar to what happens with commercial rates, if those charges are to be pursued.  That would give real decision-making powers to members of local authorities and would make them more accountable to their local electorates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">Those of us who have participated on the margins of recent local elections in this country will be aware that such elections are now being fought on national issues.  Real and meaningful debate and engagement on what the relevant authority in an area will do over its five-year term following the election is rare.  If we allow those who are elected to local authorities to become more accountable for their own budgets, we will move in the right direction towards real and meaningful local government.  The local government budgetary process goes largely unquestioned and unchecked by local authority members.  A phoney debate on the commercial rate, which balances the books at the end of the day, takes place every year when local authorities consider their estimates and budgets.  There is much more detail to be considered within the budgetary process.  I appreciate that the corporate policy subgroups within local authorities have to meet on a number of occasions as part of that process.  Having spoken to local authority members throughout the country and received feedback from their conferences, I understand that in many cases no meaningful engagement takes place during the financial and budgetary process.  If local authority members were made more responsible for their own local budgets, it would reflect well on democracy.  It would make them more accountable and make local communities more aware of the workings of local government and the impact of the policies of the councillors they elect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">I suppose the decision to merge the two local authorities in County Limerick was a compromise that was reached following the debate on the possibility of a boundary extension.  The Minister of State and I are familiar with that.  I support the decision, in general, because it represents value.  The premise and foundation for the decision is to deliver value for money.  That is a good thing to do.  We know that similar measures will be implemented in counties Tipperary and Waterford.  It was recommended that other local authority areas should be merged as single authorities as well.  That agenda needs to be driven on post haste.   I suggest the job in Limerick has only been half done, however.  The part of the University of Limerick campus in County Clare and the urban housing estates on the County Clare side of Limerick city are parts of the city, in effect.  My view and that of my party is that they should be incorporated into the Limerick city area.  As a representative of the area, the Minister of State is aware that people in those localities voted in the Limerick East constituency until recent times and now vote in the new Limerick City constituency.  We know they are part of the extended Limerick city.  On that basis, we will table an amendment to provide that the areas in question should be included in the new Limerick local authority administrative area.  I have spoken to people in Limerick city, including senior officials in Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council and people associated with the ongoing Denis Brosnan project, who feel the job has only been half-done.  The political will should exist to identify those areas as parts of Limerick city.  Now is the time to do it right.  We will discuss the amendment we have tabled on that basis on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_478">
          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
          <p eId="para_1175">We should not rush this important Bill through the Oireachtas.  It gives far too much power to the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">Sections 4 to 8 of this Bill allow these Ministers to facilitate the reorganisation, merger or abolition of State agencies and some local authorities.  The Bill can allow for the establishment of ten joint local authorities across 20 county and city councils, affecting 1.25 million people living in counties Waterford, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim, Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Cavan, Monaghan, Longford, Westmeath and my own constituency of Laois-Offaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">We support reform.  As a councillor until relatively recently, I could see the huge need for reform of local government services.  However, reform must be achieved through consultation and agreement.  Power must be devolved to local councils and communities, not taken away and centralised.  Having spoken to councillors in Waterford, Limerick, north Tipperary and south Tipperary, I can honestly say the Minister has failed to win the argument for the so-called reforms that are planned.  All that is happening is that boundaries are being moved, reducing the number of elected councillors and, unfortunately, centralising power.  This is happening through this Bill but also through other processes such as the establishment of Irish Water.  We want to see power being devolved to local level because we believe power and decision making should be vested in local councils and the community.  The Bill does the opposite.  It allows two Ministers to make far-reaching decisions about agencies, boards and local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">We have put forward amendments in a genuine attempt to reverse some of those tendencies.  Having spoken to city and county councillors, I am convinced more than ever of the folly of some of what is contained in the Bill.  Interestingly, opposition to the amalgamation of city and county councils in many areas is cross-party.  In the case of Limerick, the proposed amalgamation of the city and county councils was originally supposed to make a saving of €20 million, according to Mr. Denis Brosnan, but, as time has moved on, that figure has been reduced to closer to €3 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">A fear is that the needs of Limerick city itself might be overlooked.  The problems facing the city are complex and deep-rooted.  While some progress has been made, there are still substantial problems which require focus and a partnership approach and, therefore, gardaí, political representatives, councillors and, most importantly, the community must all be involved on an equal footing.  The Government's proposal to merge the two bodies and bring them under a single local authority will serve to weaken the position of the city and its complex problems could remain unsolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">The Bill proposes to dissolve both Limerick Regeneration boards.  Limerick Regeneration has had a chequered past and some would see it as a bit of a disaster.  In any case, it has failed to deliver.  The big announcement five years ago set out what needed to be done but what we have seen is 1,000 houses demolished and only 34 built, which is a disgrace.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, has taken a particular interest in this issue since coming into office and, hopefully, there will be improvements.  It is unacceptable that people are forced to live in the conditions that are the reality in parts of Limerick city, with vacant houses beside them and so on.  The fear now is that moving regeneration back into one big local authority with two different sets of needs for city and county will cause it to lose its focus.  While we are not against change, we will oppose this part of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">The people of Limerick do not need more regeneration boards.  They need regeneration to refocus and involve the local community, which it has failed to do so far.  Limerick needs the regeneration project to deliver on its promises.  A swift move into one big Limerick council will not deliver for the people of either the county or the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">The story of Waterford is much the same, with cross-party and business community opposition to the proposal to amalgamate the city and county councils.  Indeed, the mayor of Waterford, one of the Minister of State's Labour Party colleagues, opposes amalgamation and the city and county managers are also opposed.  Those who care to engage with elected councillors in Waterford will understand the fear that as power shifts to a single seat of power in the city, there will be a further loss of resources.  Political power will gravitate towards Waterford's urban areas, in particular Waterford city.  There are significantly different needs in the city and the county.  The towns and fishing villages along the coast have suffered huge emigration and rural depopulation.  The amalgamation will do nothing to deal with those specific problems and may make the situation worse.  Sinn Féin councillors in the area have in a constructive way proposed the sharing of resources between both local authority services without losing separate structures, focuses and identities, and we support the idea of sharing resources on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">In the case of north and south Tipperary, there is no cross-party support for the Government position and I am told by councillors that no consultation has taken place.  In fact, it is an item for debate on the agenda for next Monday's meeting of North Tipperary County Council.  To date, there has been no detailed debate in either the north or south of the county.  The local authorities are being asked to sign off on proposals that are devoid of any detail.  Both local authorities are in different economic regions at present, and I know of no plans to amend that.  The councillors I spoke to were unaware that this House was even debating this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">In the case of Limerick, there was at least an attempt to dress it up as a saving of €20 million, although that has now changed.  In the case of the Tipperary experiment, however, there will be no savings at all because, given the Croke Park agreement, the staff remain in place while new buildings will have to be sought to facilitate the integration.  In fact, this could turn out to be more expensive.  The Government's policy of amalgamating local authorities is generally based on an "economies of scale" argument.  In other words, local authorities serving a greater number of people result in lower <i>per capita</i> costs for local services.  It is important to note this argument has been disputed by many commentators, who state that amalgamation does not necessarily result in greater efficiencies.  For example, as the level of demand for services increases, the challenges, complexities and costs involved in delivery of these services may also increase.  In addition, the high costs involved in the amalgamation need to be factored in.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">I suggest to the Minister of State in a constructive way that I recently spoke to colleagues in the North, where the cost of amalgamating councils and reducing their number from 26 to 15 has proved a massive task and is one of the factors holding up the reform of public administration there.  I flag that not to put a spanner in the works.  We welcome that the Minister of State's party often refers to what is going on in the North, and I am simply pointing out the pitfalls in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">The Government claims to be committed to fundamentally reorganising local governance structures to allow for the delegation of much greater decision-making powers to local communities, giving them more control over areas such as transport, traffic, economic development and so on, but the Bill flies in the face of this commitment.  It is a top-down approach, with decisions being made at central government level and little debate or consultation with local councillors.  We propose that there should be a plebiscite on the amalgamations in Waterford, Limerick and Tipperary.  Let the Government put it to the people and let those affected decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">Section 8 of the Bill proposes to dissolve the Fire Services Council, which was set up following the Stardust tragedy.  The proposed new structure, under the National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Services Management, appears to be a top-heavy body and appears to include some of the political appointees from the previous structure.  It allows for only two representatives of the full-time fire-fighters and two representing those who are retained or part-time fire-fighters, with no apparent proper representation of the public.  I welcome the arrival in the Chamber of the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  The proposed new fire body will have no county or city councillors' representative on the board, a point I wish to highlight.  Will it be just a bureaucratic structure which does not reflect the needs of communities?</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">The Farrell Grant Sparks report initiated by a previous Minister, Noel Dempsey, proposed a national authority - a new democratic structure overseeing the national standard and national procurement policy.  However, this has been ignored.  It appears this Bill will replace one quango with another.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">The Bill also proposes that the functions being performed by An Chomhairle Leabharlanna will be subsumed into a new libraries development function within the local government management agency.  The Minister predicts that the dissolution of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, could result in savings, in terms of annual operating costs, in the region of €1 million and could yield a further once-off windfall to the State through the disposal of its headquarter buildings in Dublin's city centre.  This is naive in the current circumstances due to the collapse in property prices.  This proposal should be carefully examined.  We spoke to An Chomhairle Leabharlanna about its proposed dissolution and it did not seem to know much about it.  It referred our query to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the person to whom we spoke there was supposed to get somebody to respond to our call, but despite two attempts on our part to make contact, the Department has not got in touch with our office.  One wonders whether the Minister is running part of the Civil Service or the secret service.  We were trying to be open with it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
          <p eId="para_1191">I never had to deal with the secret service.  The Government claims that the intention of this Bill is to eliminate waste and increase efficiency by allowing for one or more bodies, such as the local government management services board, to act as a single provider of specified services rather than each of the 34 local authorities providing or acquiring these services separately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">The Government's statement on public service reform in November last year sets out the rationale for reducing the total number of State bodies or agencies in existence and sets out each Department's target in that regard for 2012.  It states that a new and expanded programme of State agency rationalisation will rationalise 48 such bodies by the end of 2012, with a further 46 to be critically reviewed by June 2012.  These measures will deliver enhanced service efficiencies, together with ensuring a more focused and democratically accountable public service.  We would support that if it could be done.  However, shockingly, no regulatory impact analysis has been carried out on this Bill.  As a result, there are no figures available with regard to the overall savings which may be made as a result of the specific changes proposed in the Bill.  There is significant spin in the Bill, but there is no detail.  This has been the hallmark of legislation from the Department to date.  In the case of the septic tank Bill, we got very little or no detail of the financial implications or the supports that would be provided.  In the case of the household charge, we got no detail on the number of homes that would have to pay it and in the case of water metering, we got no detail on who would be metered.  Now we are being asked to vote for this Bill, but no impact analysis has been done to explain it.  This is a flaw in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">In conclusion, Sinn Féin proposes that if its amendments are not accepted, the Bill should be opposed, as it gives too much power to two Ministers, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to reorganise, merge or abolish agencies without any consultation with the Oireachtas, relevant agencies or local authorities and representatives of local government bodies.</p>

          <p eId="para_1196">As the word "miscellaneous" in the Bill's Title indicates, many issues are covered in the Bill.  However, the issue on which I want to focus is the proposed merger of councils on foot of the recommendations of the local government review group.  If I had never been a councillor and was just a member of the public listening to the plan to merge councils, I would probably think this was a good idea.  The logic would be that judging by what one reads in the newspapers about councils and about them never doing any good, the fewer of them there are the better.  However, having been a county councillor I would see that as flawed logic.  It sounds logical to reduce the number of councils and cut costs, but without real reform, this will make little or no difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">For example, if one merges north and south Tipperary councils or Roscommon and Mayo councils, all one is doing is the equivalent of joining the half of two rotten apples together on the basis that one will get one wonderful pristine apple.  One will not get that.  All one will get is two halves of an apple that will rot more quickly.  That will not solve any problems.  Real local government reform means creating an environment where accountability becomes the core guiding principle.  The Minister would probably agree with that, but I would be wary as to whether he will ever do anything to achieve it.  I urge him to prove me wrong and hope he does so.</p>

          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1199">In order to get real accountability, we need massive change.  An indication that this change will not occur came from a Deputy on the Government side earlier in the year when he reminded us that while there is plenty of talk about local government reform, Members seem to forget that the consequence of that is that we will have less power in this House.  So what?  That is not what this is about.  It is not about me or the Minister being almighty or powerful.  It is about going about and bringing about reform the right way.  If this means that we no longer have power over local issues, so be it.  In fact, I say "hurrah" to that.  Our job here is to cross the t's and dot the i's on legislation.  However, under the current system we are pulled and dragged between local and national government and, either way, this does not work out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">I met a business group from Roscommon on Monday night on the issue of what could be done about rates.  I had to tell the group the truth, that under the current system it would be highly unlikely that there would be any significant reduction in rates.  One of the main reasons for that is because the council is told how to spend the major part of the moneys it gets.  With regard to the remainder, on which the council can make a decision, councillors run off with their tails between their legs if threatened by the county manager that unless they vote a certain way on the budget, X, Y or Z will happen.  Under the current system, unless councillors are very brave, or very politically naive as some might call me for trying to stand up to the county manager, they will be hit.  Therefore, there will be no accountability until we reform that system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">Let us suppose the Minister wants to save money in the long run and a suggestion is made that places like Mayo and Roscommon should merge.  That would potentially save money, but there are other ways to save the money.  In my own county, there are 26 county councillors - far too many for a population of 58,000.  I suggest that six or seven county councillors would be sufficient for County Roscommon.  This would save €1 million immediately.  These county councillors should be given real power and they should be connected to area offices all around the county.  I also suggest that there should be a directly elected mayor or that a mayor should be selected from those six or seven councillors who would be given real power.  This would mean that the next time somebody went to his or her county councillor because the council was not doing something right, the councillor would have the power to make the area engineer do what was necessary, rather than for the councillor to sit back and say there was not much he or she could do about it and that he or she would not do anything for the complainant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">In my area of Castlerea there are seven councillors.  If somebody rings one of these councillors, that councillor might go to the area office, but generally gets no result and nothing gets done.  The person might then ring another councillor and so on until all seven councillors have been rung.  Each of the councillors - as I said, it is a waste of money having so many in that size of an area - wastes the area engineer's time traipsing in and out of the office.  Eventually, the issue ends up at county council level where it might receive attention and get done.  Perhaps the local Deputy will be brought into the issue, wasting more of the area engineer's time.  If, however, the area engineer knew that the elected person had real power - someone democratically elected of whom the people were conscious and whom they knew had real power rather than some corrupt person who would ruin it all - we would have a proper improvement to the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">I said it previously and will say it again, when I was mayor of the council I was excited about the idea of perhaps being able to do something about the rates that year.  However, as Members probably already know, I was told I was not allowed to look at the figures.  If the Minister amalgamates Mayo and Roscommon, but does not change anything else, we will still have the same problems and the same waste.  I was confronted with a leak that ran like a bath for 11 years and the person with whom I was supposed to interface as the people's representative told me I am paid to think from the shoulders down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">Amalgamation of local authorities will not change anything unless councillors are given real power.  I understand the dangers involved but I trust people to make the right decision.  If they know those they elect will have a real influence over their lives, or that electing the wrong person can ruin their lives, they will think twice before they vote and we will get real change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">I get excited about the idea of local government change around the country.  Approximately €70 million passes through the coffers of my county council every year.  What could be done with that money?  The council is proposing to construct a new headquarters costing €20 million.  Even though many of the councillors believe, for ideological and practical reasons, it is a stupid project, none has opposed it because they know they will get the a lashing from the executive if they complain.  If we had real power at local level we could spend the €20 million that is supposedly coming from Exchequer on real projects.  At present we do not have that power, however.  Amalgamation will solve nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1215">I know the Ceann Comhairle will protect me from the big Minister.  The Taoiseach picked an interesting combination for local government reform.  He has the nice, meek and softly spoken Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and then he has Big Phil the enforcer - the Minister, Deputy Hogan - to do the heavy lifting.  The plan backfired, however, and it has been abandoned until after the referendum.  This Bill is being teased and tickled but nothing is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">I am in favour of cost savings and economies of scale but I am not in favour of the bully boy tactics that are being implemented in my county.  Tipperary is being hurled together.  The Ceann Comhairle will know all about Tipperary because his good wife comes from the middle part of the premier county.  It is proud horse racing country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The Minister, Deputy Hogan, appointed two former senior civil servants, who I imagine are on fine pensions, to make recommendations on the amalgamation.  The county manager for North Tipperary County Council, Mr. McGrath, was also appointed, as was the acting county manager for South Tipperary County Council.  The manager for north Tipperary was appointed as chair.  That was totally unfair and immoral.  We now find out we are losing this and that service in south Tipperary.  The Minister is out to destroy south Tipperary but we fought off Cromwell and we will fight off the Minister.  Cromwell came to Clonmel and we hunted him.  The Minister is not out of the woods yet for his attack on South Tipperary County Council.  I do not know why he is trying to bulldoze the two councils together and give all the services to north Tipperary.  Why was he unable to appoint an impartial chair or find two people other than retired civil servants who should be out playing golf?  They were probably paying golf when they were supposed to be working but now they are working and getting paid again.  It is rotten and disgraceful.</p>

It is part of Waterford city but the Minister had the audacity to give €1 million to Kilkenny officials in order to rent a building in a shopping centre for office accommodation.  He is destroying Tipperary and Limerick.  He is showing a blatant disregard for public money.  It is a horrible abuse of power and I resent it.  He has been found out by his own colleagues.  I do not see many of them this evening.  His director of elections does not want him next or near the campaign.  I just left him in the Shelbourne Hotel.</p>

I thank my colleagues for supporting the motion, which is a glorious opportunity to preserve something from our past, reflect on the aims and aspirations of the men and women of 1916 and use the monument to build and develop the future of this great island of ours.  The future should be about equality, inclusion, social justice and an end to the mindset that sadly exists of keeping our people divided.  We have much work to do and respecting diversity and difference must be at the heart of any new Ireland.  This monument and street are part of that culture.  The buildings are of national importance from a historical and cultural point of view but also as a project to raise public awareness and the huge potential of cultural tourism and jobs.  The shared history, built on equality and independence, is part of who we are and we should never forget it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">It is also an opportunity to reflect on where we are now.  As we look deep into our hearts, we can ask ourselves if the men and women of 1916 would be proud of what is going on in this country today.  Sadly, the answer is "No".  However, that does not mean we cannot change it and the motion can be used as a game changer to instil political and economic patriotism in our children and future generations on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">I am one of the people who do not accept that Ireland ends at Donegal or Dundalk.  Sadly, too many in this House live with that mindset, believing that a divided Ireland is okay.  We must examine this and we should be proud of who we are and unite to build up this great country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">I acknowledge the hard work of the relatives of the signatories to the 1916 Proclamation of independence in raising public awareness of the importance of these historic buildings and the historic area of our capital city and in securing the designation of the national monument.  I view with serious concern the deterioration of the national monument, which has languished in a vacant and neglected state for many years and the potential threat to it under a current planning application.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">I urge all Deputies to support this motion, which is about our heritage, history, commonsense, the potential for jobs and, above all, doing something noble and historic for the future of the people of this island.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_1252">I am glad to support this important motion.  The battle to preserve Nos. 14-17 Moore Street as a national monument and retention of the surrounding buildings, streets and laneways to be developed as an important historic and cultural quarter has been ongoing for years.  We are only a couple of years away from the centenary of 1916 and it is appropriate for us to try to step in and sort out the situation.  Many dedicated campaigners have been fighting on the issue for so long, which is a tribute to them but also an indictment of the system.  I was pleased to participate in a tour of the area last year.  Being there is a real eye-opener because the state of dereliction is appalling.  No other country would allow such a potentially important cultural quarter to become rundown.  Being there, one gets a sense of history and of our participation in the monumental events that took place almost 100 years ago.  The entire quarter has important historical and cultural buildings.  This includes Nos. 32 and 33 Henry Street, which are due to be demolished.  The decision is before An Bord Pleanála, which must take into account the fact that we only get one chance at it.  If this Parliament cannot sort it out, it does not say much for our abilities.  It is scandalous, and has happened far too often, that national monuments have been allowed to deteriorate.  It is timely that we discuss it this week, the week in which James Connolly, one of the key participants in 1916, founded the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">I support the motion not as a nationalist but as an internationalist.  I am conscious of the fact that what happened in 1916 was important.  When Connolly talked about raising the flag over the GPO, he said it would not be enough if we were in hock to landlords and bankers.  That is very relevant today as we look at a treaty in which our independence and control over these issues is up for debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_524">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_1254">I am also in favour of the scheme to work this area into a cultural quarter but many issues surround it.  The only part that is preserved is Nos. 14-17 Moore Street and more must be done.  The site has full planning permission with some conditions.  The developer in question is in NAMA, which gives the State more power than usual.  Aside from the huge influence of NAMA, the State has the option of a compulsory purchase order.  In any situation where the common good outweighs private property rights, the State has the right to intervene.  Many of the buildings on the street were built after 1916 but the whole street should be preserved as a cultural quarter, with the buildings rebuilt as they were before the Rising.  It would be money well spent.  A development, in a modified format, should go in tandem with it.  The scale of the development is too big for today's economic conditions and was probably over the top at the time.  There is room for developing the cultural centre in a proper manner.  A modified development could also go ahead and the two could work well together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">In any city in Europe, one sees attempts to restore historical parts of the city.  I have Turin in mind, where work has been done to restore old buildings in the old part of Turin.  New shops, apartments, residential units, bars and restaurants have been built around the old buildings in a controlled and measured way.  Ireland allowed O'Connell Street to go downhill due to a lack of planning and regulation.  O'Connell Street leaves much to be desired as one of the most prominent streets in the city but we could develop this heritage area and the development in the proper manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">I am a great believer in the value of history.  History teaches us an awful lot and is the story of how we got to where we are today, why we act as we do and why we think like we do.  Looking at politics and history over the past 100 years, people in the decision-making process, especially politicians, failed to learn the lessons of history.  In Afghanistan, the Russians were mad to go in and spent ten years there.  It was hard to credit that the Americans and British followed them in there but they have been in there for ten years now.  One group was as bad as the other and each group has made as little progress as the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">If this quarter was set up, it would provide greater awareness of history for many people in the country.  There will also be a cultural tourism aspect to this.   I would like to think the commercial and preservation aspects could go together.  For those Members interested in checking it out I recommend the Italian Quarter along the quay which has worked well.  The place was packed today in the sunshine and it has a lovely atmosphere.  Preservation and commerce can go together.  We preserved the old facade and we worked in co-operation with Dublin City Council.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Joe Costello)</from>
          <p eId="para_1259">I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Private Members' motion.  I compliment the various signatories to the motion as it gives us the opportunity to debate and find the best way to celebrate the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  We all want to ensure it is commemorated in a respectful and dignified fashion and that the two monuments encompassed by this motion, in particular the national monument in Moore Street, can be dealt with.  I commend all those who have campaigned on this issue over the years to ensure this monument and the GPO, the focal points of the 1916 Rising, would be properly preserved and play their part in the commemoration of 1916 in the future in the best form possible.  I compliment the relatives of the signatories of the Proclamation of Independence who have been ably led over a number of years by James Connolly Heron, a descendant of James Connolly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">The campaign began in 2002 when the National Graves Association informed me that the commemorative plaque which had been erected in 1966 on No. 16, Moore Street, had been removed.  I tabled a motion in Dublin City Council that No. 16 Moore Street should be deemed a preserved structure.  The plaque had been removed by a member of a consortium involved in the development and which had certain property rights on a number of houses on Moore Street.  Under pressure from Dublin City Council, the plaque was restored but no apology was received from the person who deliberately removed it and had prevented the building from being deemed a preserved structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">A public meeting was held in the Mansion House hosted by the then Lord Mayor, Dermot Lacey.  I refer to a motion agreed by Dublin City Council:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1262">Considering the historical importance of No. 16 Moore Street which was the building where the last meeting of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic Parliament on Easter Monday 1916 was held, with James Connolly, Pádraig Pearse, Willie Pearse, Seán MacDiarmada, Joseph Mary Plunkett and Thomas Clarke attending, and where the decision was taken to surrender on Saturday 29 April.  Dublin City Council agrees that No. 16 Moore Street be retained and incorporated into the planned regeneration of the immediate area and further agrees that No. 16 Moore Street become a repository of artefacts and documents relating to the historic events of 1916 and be developed as a public information and education centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">This motion was passed unanimously by Dublin City Council on 7 May 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">Dublin City Council declared the house a protected structure and commissioned the Shaffrey report which is well worth reading and which recommended that Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street should be included in the preservation order.  The then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and the Minister for the Environment, Dick Roche, declared Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street a national monument.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">This has been a developing process and there is scope for further development.  Dublin City Council gained possession from the Carlton consortium by a compulsory purchase order as a result of terrible behaviour by the private sector.  It is now in the possession of the O'Reilly consortium.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">The private ownership and the An Bord Pleanála permission pose certain problems.  The State has responsibility for national monuments and the Minister and the National Museum of Ireland have specific roles.  There is also an all-party consultative group.  The relatives of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation are anxious to expand the parameters of the national monument Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and to integrate the two national monuments into a natural geographical area and to ensure that the character of the development is appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">In his contribution to the debate last night, it would seem the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, committed himself to engage in full consultation.  He stated his primary concern would be to arrive at a determination that would best serve the long-term preservation and protection of the national monument and the commemoration and remembrance of the epic period and personalities associated with it.  There is a window of opportunity for all-party discussions with the Minister.  If this motion is put to the House tonight and the Minister's amendment is not accepted, then we will have divided the House and it will be very difficult to move forward in any constructive manner.  I ask the proposers of the motion to hold off so that we might agree a certain period of time.  I have not spoken to the Minister but he indicated in his remarks last night that he was open to consultation on the matter in an attempt to reach a satisfactory compromise because otherwise it will be a case that the House is divided in its opinion and that would be unfortunate.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_527">
          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_1268">This is a very important motion.  I pay tribute to the families and those who are campaigning because this is not about partisan politics but rather it is about our people, our heroes, our patriots, people we revere and will always do so.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, is correct that the Minister's contribution last night was very conciliatory and positive.  I echo the comments of the Minister of State that the House should not divide but rather that the Minister's amendment should be accepted to allow a cross-party consultative approach to bring about agreement on how to commemorate and celebrate 1916.  This is about our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">Last week in Arbour Hill, the Bishop of Ferns in a very provocative and challenging homily, set out the significance of 1916 for a new generation of Irish people who perhaps did not understand our history.  He spoke about how 1916 allowed us to take a new path.  He quoted Garret FitzGerald who had said about the 1916 Rising, "It was planned by men who feared that without a dramatic gesture of this kind, the sense of national identity that has survived all the hazards of the centuries would flicker out ignominiously in their lifetime, leaving Ireland psychologically as well as legally an integral part of the United Kingdom."  This is the challenge we face, to commemorate and to reach out.  I hope the House will not divide on this motion.  All of us as parliamentarians should be at that mass in Arbour Hill every year because it commemorates and celebrates in a formal way our patriots and our heroes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">I was in Gettysburg last summer and I toured the battlefields of the American Civil War.  It was a mind-blowing day and experience.  We must not allow anything to happen to this ground which is one of our sacred places.  It is a disgrace.  Dublin City Council and An Bord Pleanála have a lot to answer for.  We should never forget our past and should not have got into this position.  If we are to take a consensus approach to commemorating the 1916 centenary in four years time, we must do so devoid of party politics.  We are all republicans and want to see our country united one day.  We all believe in the aspirations of equality in the Proclamation, which is why this motion is important.  How we plan to commemorate the centenary is also important.  We are all required, as citizens, to be participants.  As the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, correctly said last night, the Rising was a seminal event and a fundamental turning point in our history.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">I hope we are discussing this matter in a non-adversarial manner because we all want to see the same result at the end of the day.  Before the end of this debate, we should reflect on how we can achieve what is best for the men and women of 1916.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekNolan" eId="spk_528">
          <from>Deputy Derek Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_1272">I am happy to speak on this motion, whose signatories meant well.  It is unfortunate, however, that we are getting two separate motions - one from the proposers and a Government amendment.  It is clear that the motion cannot be an agreed one because constitutional rights to property, planning and legislative issues are also involved in this matter.  It would, however, be a sensible and conciliatory approach to accept the Minister's offer, which he made yesterday in good faith, to have discussions to facilitate a solution.  If we had a unifying motion, rather than a divisive one, it would take the nasty sting out of this question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">The buildings in Moore Street are in an appalling state at the moment.  It does not seem right that a country which had so much wealth for so long would disregard a site of such national historic importance and allow it to become run down.  It shows that while there may have been wealth here over the past 15 years, values were not upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">Up to 2023, we will be marking a decade of centenaries, including the Civil War.  There will be a real opportunity for us to discuss our history and Irish politics generally.  Ireland has a unique and interesting history, which is detailed, layered and multifaceted, and in which various strands of society collided against one another over a long period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">Based on my own experience of the Irish education system, we have always been quick to take one aspect of a historical moment, while not defining it in any concrete or realistic way.  The 1916 Rising was not a popular revolt, it was decried by the average person in the street.  We forget that when we teach history, but that tells us something about ourselves and our country.  We must be honest about it and not pretend that everyone marched in the streets in 1916.  The general public castigated those who participated in the Rising.  It was only afterwards, when the executions took place, that public opinion started to turn.  Similarly, 1916 cannot be viewed in isolation from the First World War, the British parliamentary system, the home rule movement and the collapse of Parnell's reputation in the years before.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">The Moore Street buildings and the 1916 celebrations generally offer us a wonderful opportunity to have a detailed and educational look at our history.  Rather than taking a tokenistic or glossy view of one interesting example, we should examine the period in detail and learn about the real history of this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">When we are celebrating 1916, we should not forget places outside Dublin which also participated in the Rising.  Speaking as a representative of Galway West, I would refer specifically to the uprising that took place in Oranmore where the barracks was attacked.  The fighting subsequently continued in Athenry, where the great Liam Mellows was involved.  Let us therefore have a broad, rich and detailed understanding of our past.  We should try to learn from the people of 1916, rather than celebrating some fantasy notion.  It would be better to dedicate such an effort to the memories of those who died, rather than seeking some cheap and easy political answer.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1278">When I was preparing for this debate, I could not help but think of the words of Diarmaid Ferriter which he wrote at the time of the Mahon tribunal report.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> he wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1279">As we edge towards the centenary of the events that comprised the revolution of the early 20th century, we face a stark conclusion.  This is a State bereft of meaningful sovereignty due to its bankruptcy, and a State whose governing culture has been exposed as rotten.  We may have little to cheer about in 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">Regardless of whether one agrees with the entirety of Professor Ferriter's conclusion, one point is very clear.  That is, that as we approach 2016, which will mark the centenary of the Rising, it will offer a stark counterpoint to where we stand at the moment.  If we examine the views of the people of 1916 and what they were trying to achieve, including the ideas they had of the kind of republic they wanted to create, there can be little doubt that the crisis we are facing would be a huge disappointment to them and not reflective of the sacrifices they made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">As regards Professor Ferriter's last point, there are forces far beyond our decision on the Moore Street site that will determine whether or not we will be cheering in 2016.  The decisions we will make about the site, however, might provide some cheer to people on the centenary regardless of where we stand on other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">I echo the comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, Deputy Buttimer and others.  I acknowledge the huge work of the relatives and descendants of the 1916 leaders in keeping the flame of their memory alive.  They have kept that flame flickering though very difficult times.  I also want to acknowledge the intent of opposition Members in tabling this motion.  It would be appropriate if we could find some way of avoiding dividing the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">I believe the nature of history is to contest it.  If we do not have different views on what happened and why, and are not able to discuss them, it is not like history at all - it something that is dead and in our past.  The greatest use we can make of history is to debate it and have different views.  In that regard, how we discuss our history is inherently a political act, which is both welcome and important.  It is not necessarily a party political act, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">Everybody in the House can trace back what they are doing now to what happened in 1916.  In the centenary period we are entering, we should do all we can to ensure that we come together in a political way but not a party political way.  We are capable of doing that in so many ways as we commemorate parts of our history.  I saw Deputy Adams and other members of his party at Arbour Hill last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">I hope the points that the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, have made will be taken on board.  In his concluding speech last night, the Minister said he wanted to best serve the long-term preservation and protection of the national monument itself and the commemoration and remembrance of the epic period.  It was the period that created our nation that led to this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">As the debate continues, I hope those proposing this motion will decide not to divide the House and instead take up the Minister's offer so we can reflect on it in a proper political fashion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe O’Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_1287">It merits repeating that there is no question but that 1916 was a seminal event in our history.  There is no question that the participants, in the main, were driven by the highest ideals and by heroism and both merit acknowledgement in a debate such as this.  There is also no doubt that a number of them had a very romantic view of life but even at that they were driven by the highest ideals and were very unself-absorbed, sincere good people.  That merits repeating.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">As we approach the decade of commemorations, it is important to acknowledge the heroism and idealism of those people who led and participated in the Rising but it is also important to acknowledge that they are part of our collective DNA - our memory and admiration of them - and our individual DNA to the extent that people still have a great regard for what they did, and for their relatives and their desire to perpetuate correctly their memory and commemoration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">It is important that the entire period of commemoration, including the centenary of 1916, is done in an mutually respectful and inclusive way, that it is done alongside the other commemorations and that implicit in it is a recognition of the heroism and idealism of people who did not go in particular one way or another.  There were some very idealistic people who chose to go to fight in the First World War and there were very idealistic people in 1916.  We must recognise all this as a collective and have mutual respect in the way we celebrate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">There is merit in the view emerging in the debate and that was proposed by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, last night that we try to proceed by consensus on this in the national Parliament.  I appeal to everyone here to do that.  It might be the most fitting tribute we could give to the idealism, romanticism, heroism and everything that went with the heroes of 1916 that we would proceed collectively with regard to the commemoration and the buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">There is no doubt that Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street are hugely important monuments in that the last council of war was held there and those buildings are hugely central.  With regard to all the planning material that has gone through An Bord Pleanála and all the plans that are on the Minister's table for consent, there is no provision within them to take away in any way from the integrity of the buildings.  It is not a question that only their facades would be preserved or that they would be demolished or disfigured in any way other than what must be done structurally for health and safety reasons.  The integrity of the buildings will be preserved as a monument and it is right that should be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">The difficulty with the proposition that we make the entire street a commemorative area is that there are issues around private property, timing and funding.  It would be better if we were to take the proposal for the development of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and put a very good commemorative centre in place there.  It is implicit in the planning permission for the other developments that they take cognisance of that and in no way disturb the historical element of the street.  It is better that we proceed on that basis.  I think that is the view of the original group of relatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">I congratulate the people who brought forward this important motion.  The events of 1916 were hugely significant.  They changed the face of Ireland and had enormous implications for our history, for where we are today and for the very building we are in.  I appeal to the proposers of the motion, who put it forward in good faith, to consider the Minister's suggestion of working collectively and in a collegial way to arrive at an eventual outcome that will honour the participants, respect the relatives who are in the Visitors Gallery and the people who admirably fought for many years to preserve the buildings.</p>

          <p eId="para_1294">I commend Deputy McLellan on bringing this timely motion before the House.  This is the Deputy's first time to bring forward a motion and I say well done to her on her choice of subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">I commend the family members associated with the motion.  I had the opportunity to invite them to attend a meeting of a joint committee to discuss this issue and in my input to this debate I would like to reflect some of the comments they made on that occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">I have known the names of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation off by heart since I was a child.  That is not because I was a good history student as a child but because I come from the parish of Ballyphelane where the name of every road is called after the signatories of the Proclamation.  There is Pearse Road, Clarkes Road, Ceannt Road and, fittingly, I come from Connolly Road.  That shows that when we mark significant events in our history in our local neighbourhoods, they have an impact in our formative years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">It is in the context of the parish of Ballyphelane and the names of the signatories to the Proclamation assigned to the roads there that I would like to give some context to the motion.  The Sinn Féin motion and the Government's counter amendment to it are very much saying the same thing.  They refer to the preservation of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street.  When republican issues are discussed, the first thing on the agenda is a split but, unusually, there might not necessarily be a split on this issue this evening.  I urge both sides of the House to come together on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">The Sinn Féin motion is limited in its scope.  I would like 1916 to be commemorated nationally and far broader than in the context of Nos. 14 to 17, Moore Street.  That is the way the commemoration of it should be developed.  The events of 1916 had ramifications for the whole of this island.  Deputy Nolan mentioned Galway and my great grandfather was involved with Roger Casement in Kerry.  He was a Kerry man.  That is a hard thing for a Cork man to admit but he has a strong Republican tradition in Rock Street in Tralee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">Dublin City Council has failed time and again to do something with Moore Street.  On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of 1916 something could have been done, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary there was an opportunity to do something and on the 90th anniversary, only a few years ago, when the dogs were literally eating the cheques in this country and there was plenty of money to do something nothing was done.  What we have seen, not only in Moore Street but in all the area north of O'Connell Bridge, has been the development of a type of honky-tonk, pop-up retail concept that has not been in the interests of the capital city.  There is usually some ambiance or nuance to a capital city that captures people's minds.  I am proud to say that if one comes to Cork City, we have the English Market and other events - Dublin does not have that type of concept.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">It is on that basis I make a few points that I believe reflect the position of some of the descendents.  The planning proposal being considered is flawed and I do not believe it will come to pass.  The retail model presented in the planning application is something of the past.  We should consider putting in place a different type of retail model in the environs of Moore Street, one with rent controls that would allow indigenous companies and manufacturers to sell their wares in the greater Moore Street area.  It would give Dublin City centre a flavour and ambiance that the citizens would like to have in their capital city.  By extending the commemorative process to the battlefield site and other areas, we would have a different type of 1916 celebration that would not be confined to only four buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">What I propose, if all-party agreement could be reached on this, is that we not only consider Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street in this context but that we look at how we want to see Dublin city centre commemorate 1916 not only in terms of the past but in terms of our vision for its future.  Having big supermarkets in the middle of the our capital city is not our vision for the development of the city, rather we want to have a more sustainable business and retail model.  I saw plans for a proposal to imprint on the street a bronze copy of the proclamation the size of the Chamber so local and Irish citizens and foreign visitors walking up and down could see and feel the proclamation itself.  Commemorating 1916 is not only about now, but also about the future and many positive opportunities can be achieved through cross-party co-operation, because 1916 is part of all our heritage and does not belong to an individual party or Member of the House.  This is also an opportunity to revitalise this part of Dublin, which should have been done long ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_1303">It is not possible to overstate the importance of commemorating the site of the 1916 Rising.  It is even more important because of the terrible situation in which the country now finds itself.  In many ways it is as significant an historic crossroads as the one at which we found ourselves in 1916.  It is tremendously important that we honour and pay proper tribute to the heroes of 1916, their political determination, vision, bravery and heroism and properly commemorate this memory and protect the site of the last stand of the 1916 rebels precisely to remind us of what political vision, bravery and determination look like at a time when we desperately need them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">The 1916 Easter Rising was the first strike in the foundation of the State.  It was also the first strike in the international movement against the horrors of the First World War.  It was the beginning of the end of the British Empire, and an inspiration to peoples and movements throughout the world who struck out against colonisation and empire.  It is a monument of international significance.  Even at the time, the 1916 rebellion echoed across the European continent and beyond.  It is very important that we do justice to this memory.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">I do not understand why, if the Government states it agrees with the general spirit of the motion, it has proposed an amendment.  All the motion proposes is that nothing should be done which would compromise this historic site; that any development which takes place in the area should ensure the proper preservation of the historic site; and it should be developed as an historic quarter.  There is no reason for the Government to table an amendment.  The details can be debated and discussed with the families and other stakeholders but there does not seem to be anything objectionable in the original motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">Even in terms of modern economic concerns, it is quite telling how we deal with these matters when we speak about the development of our city centre.  Why do people come here?  What is it that makes the country attractive to people?  Is it building shopping centres and monuments to consumerism or is it precisely our history and our architectural, historical and political heritage?  Commemorating this history and heritage properly, sensitively and respectfully will not only pay proper tribute to the rebels of 1916, but it will make Dublin a more attractive place.  It will be a boost to tourism at every level.  It will be a win for the city and the country.  Desecrating this historic site would have the opposite effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">I appeal to the Government to support the motion.  There is no need to amend it.  The details can be worked out with all the stakeholders as we move along.</p>

          <p eId="para_1308">I thank the proposers of the motion for tabling it.  I have been to Moore Street and I did the tour.  If one was not familiar with it and went there, one would be appalled that a national monument is in such a deplorable state, and we should all feel a sense of shame about this.  The buildings are listed for protection not because of their architectural merit, but because of their significant historical merit.  This historical merit is not only with regard to the buildings and their facades, but also their curtilage.  It is about the context of the site and it is important we recognise this and preserve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">The madness of the Celtic tiger era is marked out by the fact that everything was measured in monetary terms.  People did not buy homes; they bought property and we had trophy sites.  It is very hard to find positives in the crash, but at least it has given us the opportunity to stand back and look at what is important and see where failures occurred since the 1916 Rising and the foundation of the State.  If we are to rebuild society in the country we must draw from the idealism of the past.  The people of the past seemed to be able to aspire to more than we can in this difficult but more wealthy time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">I am very lucky to be on the commemorative committee.  The next ten years will be wonderful with a very inclusive and broad range of events to be commemorated.  It is very important that we leave markers from the defining time in which we live, and some of these markers must be physical, such as buildings and places, and they must draw from the past.  It is very important that we do this.  Very few intact sites remain from the era we are discussing.  Bolands Mill was not really one of the buildings involved but it is seen as part of the Rising and its condition is deplorable.  The wall of the Mendicity Institution opposite the Four Courts is covered in graffiti.  One wonders where is our civic morality and pride and we should aspire to re-engage with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">Just as 1916 was a defining era, so is this one.  We have had failures over the past 100 years and this is an opportunity for us to look forward and have a different set of values and learn from the past.  Places and buildings will be important in this as well as heritage, history and idealism.</p>

I also compliment the relatives without whose determination and foresight the motion would not be on the clár.  I support the motion 100%.  We are speaking about the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street which is of major significant historic importance.  The idea of developing an historic quarter and battlefield site is most appropriate for the area and most appropriate as a way to commemorate and celebrate the 1916 Rising.  It is also appropriate this on the clár in the run-up to the centenary of the Rising, and at a time when our independence and sovereignty are in danger, if they are not already gone, in the run-up to the fiscal treaty referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">The commemoration of the 1916 Rising is not only a commemoration of bricks and mortar, as important as this may be.  We need to celebrate the ideas, beliefs and policies of the 1916 leaders.  The Proclamation was a blueprint for the future Republic as they saw it.  We need to ask ourselves how we measure up to that Proclamation.  The honest answer must be that we have a long way to go.  These leaders wanted to cherish "all the children of the nation equally".  What would they think of 100,000 children living in poverty in 2012?  What would they think of reductions in child benefit?  What would they think of the targeting of children with disabilities with the refusals for domiciliary care allowance doubled in the course of the Government's tenure in office?  These are the kinds of questions we need to ask ourselves in the run-up to the centenary of the 1916 Rising.</p>

          <p eId="para_1316">Almost 100 years ago, the city of Dublin and the entire island of Ireland were in a state of desperation.  There was rampant unemployment, a massive rate of child mortality and swelling slums were rife.  The only option for many was to be shipped off to the killing fields of Europe to spill their blood for their imperialist oppressor.  Out of all this despair, blackness and destitution arrived the men and women of 1916.  They offered the people an alternative vision.  They declared that: "The Republic guarantees ... equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally".  The hope and vision they offered to Ireland to strike for her freedom is as true today as it was 100 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">Ireland today is searching for hope in these turbulent economic times.  Similar to the conditions in which the men and women of 1916 found themselves, we today are again at the whim of foreign rulers and foreign markets.  There is no finer example of courage and determination than the example the men and women of 1916 set.  For the past 100 years we have drawn inspiration from their heroism.  As we are now in these difficult times, I am sure we will draw further inspiration from them into the future.  That is one of the reasons it is essential that the buildings at 14-17 Moore Street are protected.  These are more than just bricks and mortar; they are a symbol of why we exist as a country and as a people.  The buildings on Moore Street make up a very important part of the story of us as a nation.  From the small rooms on that terraced block emerged this Parliament.  Every Deputy who speaks in this Chamber owes an allegiance to the history of Moore Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">I believe that every Member of this House believes that these buildings are a national monument and a treasure of the State.  Moore Street is also a site of educational wealth and all children in our schools should know the history of their country.  There is far more educational value in these buildings being preserved as a national monument than any shopping centre could ever provide.  Similarly this country is a major tourism destination with millions of visitors every year.  The value of such an important historical site cannot be compared to a high-street brand that can be found in any other city in the Western world.  Ireland's deep and rich history is one of the reasons so many tourists are attracted to come here every year.  Shopping centres come and go but if these historic buildings are destroyed they will be gone forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">We should remember with pride the men and women of 1916.  I think of Leitrim's Seán Mac Diarmada, who fought and died so that we could sit in this Chamber today.  Seán Mac Diarmada suffered from polio but struggled through his disability to play a leading role in the 1916 Easter Rising.  He was a brave soldier and an example to future generations.  Many people visit his beautifully preserved cottage in Corranmore, Kiltyclogher, which is part of our wonderful history.  We must take it upon ourselves not to sully the name of Seán Mac Diarmada or any of the heroes of 1916 and hand over such an important landmark to become a shopping centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">The Minister has said the Sinn Féin motion is too narrow in its vision but I respectfully suggest otherwise.  Moore Street is a central and essential fulcrum for historical tourism in the island of Ireland.  If we allow these buildings to be destroyed, that essential part of 1916 tourism will be lost and gone forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">On my local radio station, Ocean FM, I pointed out that we had tabled this motion and it got a strong reaction most of which was very positive.  One person criticised it by saying that I would be better off talking about local issues rather than talking about Moore Street in Dublin.  With respect I would say that person was a parochial philistine and I hope there will not be too many philistines if it comes to a vote on the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1322">The year 1916 was a milestone in our history and 2016 would be an ideal time to showcase not only a new cultural quarter but also the ideals and sacrifices of our ancestors in a meaningful way.  The 1916 Rising encapsulates a very important part of my Irishness.  This Irishness is not the superficial "wrap the green flag around me" nationalism that has so often been represented by the opportunists who have frequented this House.  It is the pursuit of justice and freedom which was a beacon to the people of the world sending the message that no matter where or how downtrodden or outnumbered people are the base desire to say that they are free and equal will never be quenched.  It sends the message that their struggle can strike a mighty blow, weakening the chains of imperialism and capitalism around the world for all people.  That beacon was not forgotten.  The spirit of the men and women of 1916 inspired the people of Vietnam, Russia and Cuba.  It inspired black leaders in America and the beaten and brutalised of the Bogside in Derry and the ghettoes of Belfast - and it still inspires.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">Every year thousands of people commemorate this event.  They commemorate men and women who struck for freedom against the biggest empire on the earth, which cut down its enemies with great indecency and little thought.  They were heroes who fought for a better Ireland against their own self-interest - a lesson well remembered today.  In particular we must remember the role of the women of 1916 who fought alongside their male comrades as equals.  This memory, while strong in many, is in danger.  Many people would have a better chance of naming the starting 11 for Manchester United than the seven signatories.  Worse still the ideals they held are being betrayed at every turn and the Republic for which they fought can often seem far from our grasp.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">I have not given up, but I am lucky in having a very real link to these great people as a grandson of two veterans who fought that noble fight.  I will never forget the stories that struck me as a child and remain with me.  Young people today do not have this great resource.  The last veterans have long since passed away.  We must at least do this service for the heroes of Easter 1916 and not demolish all traces of their words, thoughts and deeds.  I have toured the battle site with the wonderful people involved in the campaign to save Moore Street.  I encourage anyone who has not done that to do so.  I have seen their excellent plan for the 1916 quarter, which would be the pride of Dublin and Ireland.  I am proud to come from Dublin, a city with a true revolutionary history and home to great men and women, such as Connolly, Pearse, Markievicz and many others.  I would be proud to bring people from around the world to this city's centre to show them our history.  At present such a place is sorely lacking.  We must rectify this, the first step being to save Moore Street.  The creation of a cultural quarter, with museums and workshops, would be a mecca for tourists and the people of this country to visit.  Molaim an rún seo.</p>

          <p eId="para_1325">Occasionally I get an opportunity in Donegal to give a talk to American students.  It is a brush stroke history of Ireland, and I always enjoy the part about the lead up to the 1916 Rising, its aftermath and what it meant for the Irish people.  Juxtapose the slaughter in the Somme not long after the Rising in which Irish Unionists and Nationalists were slaughtered - more than 20,000 people were killed in one day, on 1 July 1916, and over 30,000 were injured in a foolish slaughter driven by king or kaiser - with Connolly's Irish Citizen Army and its famous banner, "We serve neither King nor Kaiser but Ireland."  They were visionaries.  It was a fusion of radicals, visionaries, cultural revivalists and feminists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">Consider the first words of the Proclamation: "Irishmen and Irishwomen".  At a time when women did not even have a vote, that was a radical statement of intent.  They were poets, visionaries, trade unionists, suffragettes, cultural revivalists and people who were trying to fight for all that is good.  Read the Proclamation.  There is no nation on earth that would not be proud of the words in it.  There is no hint of sectarianism or hate.  It is about unity, fairness, equality and decency.  It is a platform not just for Irish humanity but for world humanity.  Those leaders inspired people across the world.  We know the British Empire was an unjust empire, but the world was an unjust place as could be seen in the World War taking place at that time.  It was a disaster in which working class people were slaughtered in fields in their hundreds of thousands and millions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">Our heroes, however, were not acting for popularity.  They were visionaries.  As they were led away they were jeered, but in a few short years the Irish people would realise what a wonderful legacy they had been given and would endorse in the first Dáil the 1916 Proclamation in their programme for government.  That is our inheritance, and it is a wonderful inheritance.  In 2012, however, much of that inheritance has been squandered.  We have an economic crisis because we abandoned the ideals which they represented and gave to us.  Knowing all that we know now about the greed that caused this crisis, are we really going to allow these buildings to be torn asunder?</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">I, too, had the honour of walking the route of Henry Place, Moore Lane and Moore Street.  The hair stood on the back of my neck at the thought of these amazing and unbelievably courageous people being evacuated from the GPO and being led eventually into Moore Street, where they surrendered.  Their spirit was defeated and they probably thought their struggle was defeated.  If they only knew what they gave birth to.  It is a wonderful story to tell, not just to Irish people but also to visitors from throughout the world.  People around the world have looked at our history, and anybody who has had the privilege of travelling across the world will recall seeing the glint in people's eyes when they have told them they are Irish.  Despite all our economic problems and the damage to our reputation, the stories people around the world think of are those of the 1916 Rising and Bobby Sands.  That is what inspires them and gives them hope in their own struggles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">Now, when we have a chance to set this nation and island back in the right direction after the mess caused by greed, let us grasp the opportunity to do all we can to seize those buildings and send a signal that we value our inheritance and those who gave birth to what we have today, and that we intend to complete their journey.  That is the challenge for the Members of this House.  Can all Members of the House, of all political colours and creeds, unite on this issue?  Then, perhaps, we would deserve the legacy we have been given.</p>

Guím gach rath ar an bhfeachtas atá amach rompu agus romhainn uilig le cinntiú go mbeidh ionad cultúrtha agus ceathrú stairiúil tógtha ar an suíomh seo i Sráid Uí Mhórdha i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Is deas an rud é go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo againn.  A mhéid is eol dom, is é seo an chéad uair dúinn plé a dhéanamh ar na foirgnimh a bhaineann le Éirí Amach na Cásca agus an comóradh a bheidh againn amach anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">Many of us have spoken tonight about the bravery of the men and women who fought in 1916, and about their honour, passion and dignity as the final moments pressed on them.  We know what the goals of those men and women were and how badly they have been let down, not just by our failure as a State to mark and commemorate places such as Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street but by what has been allowed to happen in our society.  Rather than establish a nation built on the ideals of the Proclamation and the democratic programme, this State allowed the worst kind of cronyism and corruption to dominate politics and the economy for the last few decades.  It is ironic that the man who would show such disregard for the historical significance of the buildings we are discussing is part of the Anglo Irish Bank golden circle and a developer who has been brought into the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">I do not wish to dwell on the reputation and history of this developer.  We all know how the developers, as a group, influenced bad planning policy and how that contributed, along with the failed policies of the banks and the last Government, to bring this State to its knees.  What matters is that even after all the sordid history, a developer still appears to be holding all the cards with regard to a piece of our history which is of monumental significance.  Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and its surroundings, the battlefield site, badly need to be restored, protected and respected.  The area cannot be left as it is.  It must be protected and there must be development.  However, what type of development should it be?  It is proposed that we build another shopping centre.  Do we need another shopping centre in the middle of Dublin city?  Have we learned nothing from the mistakes and lessons of the last number of years?</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">The abject failure to fulfil the vision of the men and women who fought for our freedom can be seen in the terrible state of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and its surroundings.  However, it can also be seen in more than bricks and mortar.  In the last two weeks two news stories struck a chord with me, and probably with many others.  The first was the news that a seven year old child had collapsed in a school in Cork.  The child was later diagnosed with severe malnutrition.  The second news story was that, once again, the Government has approved salaries above the agreed limits for public servants in the President's offices.  How starkly these two news reports contrast with the ideals, hopes and visions of the heroes of 1916.  "Cherishing  all the children of the nation equally" is a simple yet powerful commitment in the Proclamation that successive Governments have ignored and still ignore.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">In 2012, children should not be collapsing from hunger.  We know people are suffering; we hear about it every day.  It is not a cliché to say that this is not what the men and women of 1916 died for.  They did not fight and die so this State could make its people shoulder the burden of failing private banks, so we could watch yet another generation of our young people leave our shores or so the democratically elected representatives of the people could pay themselves handsome salaries while children go to school with nothing in their bellies.  It is of paramount importance that 14-17 Moore Street and the battle site area are preserved, protected and acknowledged.  Moreover, it should be done in a manner that retains the potential to develop the site as a 1916 historic and cultural quarter.  However, that should only be the first step in honouring those who gave so much for what they believed in.  They believed in a different type of Ireland.  While a cultural and historic quarter must be built, the best tribute Members can give to the men and women of 1916 is to build the lasting legacy, namely, the type of united Ireland for which they fought and died.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">I will conclude by noting the Minister has argued the motion tabled by Sinn Féin is similar to his amendment.  The difference is the motion would prevent the Minister from encroaching on this historic monument and allowing a shopping mall.  The Minister sat in this Chamber while rare snails halted major development in this country.  It is not a rare snail under discussion this evening but the council of war's last location.  Must one begin to scout around Moore Street to find a rare snail to give the Minister an excuse to preserve this monument?  I ask him to do the right thing.</p>

The Government amendment to the motion is, in part, necessary because of factual inaccuracies in the original wording.  It referred to a current planning application whereas none actually exists.  Although Sinn Féin was made aware of this last week, the misapprehension was compounded when Deputy Ó Caoláin last night referred to circumstances where planning permission could be refused because of the existence of a national monument.  However, full planning permission was granted for the development of the site containing the national monument by An Bord Pleanála in 2010.  That permission took full account of the existence of the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street.  There is no new application for planning permission and nor is it apparent from where such an application might come at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">It is important to understand that what is being examined at present is an application for consent for proposed works to a national monument under the National Monuments Acts.  The impact of the motion as drafted would be potentially to prejudice the application for consent, which is before the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and on which a decision has yet to be made.  This is a further reason the motion as presented, with much of which Members on this side of the House can agree, could not be supported this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">It also was clear from the references made to the national monument being torn down that there were similar misunderstandings about what is actually being proposed regarding the national monument site.  As the Minister pointed out, the Moore Street monument is fully protected under the National Monuments Acts.  No works can be undertaken without the Minister's consent under those Acts.  The proposals that are the subject of the current consent application to the Minister are for a 1916 commemorative centre at 14-17 Moore Street and the pressing need for such a facility in this area was highlighted by all speakers last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">I again strongly emphasise the point that the application for consent before the Minister does not include any proposal to demolish the national monument and nor does it envisage only the facades of the buildings being kept.  The bulk of the internal and external structures of 14-17 Moore Street would be retained and each of the buildings would be part of the proposed commemorative centre, with No. 16, the location of the final council of war, serving as the focal point.  It is this and only this proposal, namely, the provision of the commemorative centre at the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street that now is before the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, for decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">Ba mhaith liom, i bpáirt le gach aon duine eile a labhair, mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do ghaolta lucht sínithe Fhorógra na Poblachta. Tá ár mbuíochas tuillte acu as an méid a rinne siad, i bpáirt le feachtasóirí eile, chun a chinntiú gur mhair an séadchomhartha náisiúnta seo, cé go raibh roinnt mhaith bagairtí air ó am go chéile i stair an Stáit.  Is de bharr a gcuid gníomhartha siúd go bhfuil an deis ann anois comóradh an chéid ar na himeachtaí a tharla i Sráid Uí Mhórdha a cheiliúradh sna foirgnimh chéanna inar tharla na himeachtaí suntasacha sin.  Sílim go n-aontaíonn muid ar fad leis an bhfís go mbeadh séadchomhartha náisiúnta Shráid Uí Mhórdha caomhnaithe agus curtha i láthair go cuí, mar lárionad do chomóradh an chéid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">Among those to be remembered is Major General Joe Sweeney from Burtonport, then a Lieutenant in E Company of the 4th Battalion, who was at Liberty Hall before making his way to the GPO.  He fought on the roof and inside the GPO all week.  On Saturday, he helped to carry James Connolly on a stretcher down through the houses to his makeshift hospital bed in No. 16 Moore Street.  The Major General's family have been in contact with me regarding invitations to the Arbour Hill commemoration.  They are entitled to such invitations and should attend this commemoration.  This is an issue I have raised with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, who has responsibility for that commemoration.</p>

          <p eId="para_1345">I am pleased to speak on this motion and it is gratifying to hear the leaders of the 1916 Rising lauded in this Chamber.  Their bravery, vision and unquenchable desire for freedom should be fully acknowledged by all present.  They took the fight to the imperial master.  They had a vision for a republic set out in the Proclamation read at the GPO in Easter week.  They fought for a free, united and pluralist republic and undoubtedly, the events of Easter week 1916 were seminal in Irish history.  The Republic was proclaimed but sadly, the Republic has yet to be realised.  However, it is worth stating during this debate that the vision of the women and men of 1916 lives on and, to coin a phrase, "They haven't gone away, you know".</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">There appears to be some misunderstanding on the Government Benches in respect of this motion.  There appears to be an assumption that a party, presumably Sinn Féin, seeks to claim ownership of this episode in our history and of the vision for the Republic.  That clearly is not the case.  Had the Government Members read our motion correctly, they would have seen this motion is supported not just by Sinn Féin but also by Fianna Fáil and a host of Independent Deputies.</p>

          <p eId="para_1349">It is both telling and negative that Members are even having this debate in the Chamber this evening.  I cannot imagine that in any other country or European democracy there would even be a debate around the necessity to preserve the national monument and to do so in the most fulsome of ways.  Rather that limiting preservation to a number of houses on a terrace we should be preserving the entire terrace and looking to preserving the entire battlefield, including the laneways, which is the setting in which the heroic deeds of 1916 were played out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">That the proposal that has gained planning permission is for a shopping mall in an area that should be a national monument is damning.  My colleagues have articulated the many reasons this monument must be developed and the gains it would represent in terms of tourism and a proper acknowledgement not alone of our history but of the real political relevance in the here and now of the leaders of 1916.</p>

It is fair to say that no individual political party can claim the legacy of 1916 for itself but we can fairly say that it is the responsibility of every party and elected Member of this House to ensure tha memory is honoured and that the national monument is truly one which honours the memory of those great heroic women and men.</p>

          <p eId="para_1357">William Butler Yeats' poem, September 1913, applies perfectly to the survival of the Moore Street national monument and the clash between two starkly different cultures.  On the one hand there is a culture of naked consumerism, which is exemplified by one developer's ambition to create yet another cathedral to the God of profit, another mall in a city of malls.  Yeats summed up that mindset:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1358">What need you, being come to sense,But fumble in a greasy tillAnd add the halfpence to the penceAnd prayer to shivering prayer, untilYou have dried the marrow from the bone?</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">The other side of this clash of cultures is located on the GPO battlefield site.  This sorry saga, even the need for this debate, is a metaphor for our times.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, described the lanes from Tom Clarke's shop on Parnell Street to the GPO, Henry Street where the Proclamation was signed, Moore Lane and Moore Street where the GPO garrison retreated to the spot where the O'Rahilly died, to the Rotunda where the garrison was held by the British and where the volunteers were founded three years earlier, as the lanes of history, na lanaí stairiúla.  These are all places intimately connected to the Rising and to the men and women who participated in it.  These modest buildings in the back lanes provide a tangible link with the great idea at the core of the Rising, namely, that we could be free and equal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">Busts of the signatories look down on us from the floor above.  Five of those signatories spent their last hours of freedom in Moore Street before being taken from there to their deaths.  We know their names and should know their strengths of character.  Yeats did.  They were of a different kind, the names that stilled out childish play.  It is a great honour to this Oireachtas that the relatives of these leaders are with us this evening.  Cuirim fáilte mór rompu uilig.  Moore Street and its environs are at the heart and soul of the 1916 Rising.  If consumerism and the rush to profit have their way the buildings and lanes around Moore Street will be obliterated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">The Minister is being asked to grant his consent for a change to this national monument.  He set out his position in this regard last night and highlighted the difficulties he faces in terms of planning permission already granted.  He rightly decried the fact that the surrounding lanes were not in 2007 designated as part of the national monument.  It is almost as if he is confronted by a dilemma.  There is no dilemma.  There is only one position for a Minister and the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, knows this.  There are no circumstances or justification for giving the go-ahead to a development that will demolish any part of a national monument, including buildings within its protected boundary, in the commercial interest of a private property developer.  I spoke privately with the Minister on this issue.  There is a moral obligation on him and the Government to develop this area as a historic revolutionary quarter.  There can be no "if", "buts" or qualifications in this regard.  The impact of the Minister giving his consent - other speakers either do not understand this or do not want to understand it - to the construction of this mall would be the destruction of all the outbuildings and yards to the rear of the national monument buildings.  The buildings on each side of the four monument buildings would be demolished and the lanes would disappear.  Where the O'Rahilly was killed would be under a car park.  Thereafter the project for a battlefield site would have to be abandoned.  That would be the Minister's legacy, one which I know he does not want.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">This is where Pearse, Clarke, MacDiarmada, Plunkett and the wounded Connolly met as leaders for the last time.  These are the lanes where Michael Collins and others courageously fought a superior British force.  Moore Street and the lanes of history are connected to the six days of fighting and the last hours of the 1916 leaders and the Rising.  For most of this to disappear under a mall would be unforgivable.  The Government can take action to preserve this historic site and to develop the area as a fitting tribute.  Luke Kelly put it well when he said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1363">To whom do we owe our allegiance today</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1364">To those brave men who fought and died that Róisín live again with pride?</p>

Many people who come to the city, from across the island and particularly from across the world, come for the revolution, the failed revolution.  The Rising of 1916 is the reason they come, for example, to Kilmainham Gaol.  There is potential to develop other sites across Ireland, for example, an interpretive centre at Pearse's cottage in Rosmuc or at Connolly's home on the Falls Road in west Belfast.  There is an undoubted massive tourism and educational potential in the GPO battlefield site and an opportunity to revive Dublin city centre either with this site on its own or combined with a 1916 trail which could include Arbour Hill and Glasnevin cemeteries, Collins Barracks Museum, Kilmainham Gaol, other battlefield sites throughout the city and a dedicated 1916 museum.</p>

          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_1519">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2012.  Everybody in this House will acknowledge that the reform of local government is badly needed.  To be honest, it should have been tackled a long time ago.  The Government has no choice other than to find savings.  If we are to do this, we must eradicate any identified inefficiencies in services.  When examining the Bill, I noticed some of the bodies being dissolved are of the type most people will never have heard of, let alone know what they do.  For example, the Local Government Computer Services Board was established in 1975 to provide advice and to help local authorities with their ICT systems.  That was all very well and good in 1975 when the world, never mind Ireland, was very much in its infancy with regard to ICT, software and so on.  However, we now live in a very high-tech society and children as young as five or six are equipped to use computers.  Admittedly, there can be problems with any system which will require outside assistance but this cannot justify the existence of an entirely separate body.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520">Every business in this country has to constantly re-examine how it works.  They are always looking at new ways of doing things to see how they can work smarter and more efficiently to improve margins and to reduce costs.  This is particularly the case since the economic downturn.  Businesses must now eliminate waste and increase efficiency to survive.  It is important that the public service follows this example and continues to look at more efficient and effective ways to deliver services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1521">Dissolving these bodies and transferring functions back to local government is a step in the right direction in terms of creating a more accountable service.  I am firmly of the belief that a one-stop shop for services is the way forward.  There are times when people almost feel they would require a sat-nav to find out to where they need to go when trying to locate the right Department or section, never mind trying to find the right person.  This is not good.  It means people can be brushed off and told it is a matter for a different section, which creates a lack of accountability and serious frustration for the customer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1522">The Local Government Efficiency Review Group recommends the establishment of a number of joint administrative structures covering two counties for the purpose of joint management teams and pooled corporate functions.  I agree shared services are a positive move, particularly with regard to IT, HR and financial services.  However, it is important that each county should have its own county manager.  Each county is, after all, individual in its own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1523">I can speak only for my own constituency and we are very lucky in that I know the respective county managers in Cavan and Monaghan do excellent work.  I strongly urge the Minister not to allow a situation whereby we would have only one manager serving two counties as this would cause problems in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency.  There would be, no doubt, certain areas that would feel they were being left on the periphery, depending on where the managers are based.  I do not believe this is desirable as it has the potential to create a "them and us" mentality between the two counties with regard to various projects and funding allocations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524">Local government is often seen as the poor relation to central government.  However, I am proud to say I served as member of Monaghan County Council for eight years prior to my election to Dáil Éireann.  In that time, I saw first-hand the positive side of local government.  It is important that, while recognising reform is necessary, we also give credit where it is due.  County councils were the first to feel the effects of the downturn and bore the brunt of initial cutbacks.  This means that, in recent years, local authorities have managed to deliver a very good standard of service on vastly reduced budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1525">I do not share the views of Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan regarding the service he received from the county council.  My experience of Monaghan County Council was a much better one.  Genuine, hard-working engineers and council staff do their best and often go way beyond the call of duty to serve the people of the county.  It disappoints me to hear elected Members making disparaging comments about county council staff because they are always an easy target - it is a populist thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526">I commend the Minister on bringing forward the Bill and on his continued efforts to reform local government.  I would impress upon him the importance of consulting and involving local authorities, both staff and elected members, in the reform process as they have much to offer in this regard.  They have on-the-ground experience and I believe it is buy-in at local level that will ensure success.  While central Government is often more detached from events on the ground, there is a great level of connectivity between people and the members of the local council.  It is very important that this sense of community and connectivity is not lost.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_583">
          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell</from>
          <p eId="para_1527">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, for her earlier speech.  It was said already, and I would like to repeat, that while the Bill is quite a technical document, it was refreshing to receive such a frank and simple explanation from the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528">There is a requirement on the part of the Government to continue to abolish unnecessary and superfluous agencies and quangos in an effort to streamline the delivery of services within local government and, ultimately, improve delivery for our customers, the taxpayers.  The pooling of resources and expertise into one agency will save money both in terms of manpower and the procurement services offered until recently by separate agencies and by local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529">The centralisation of local government is a piece in the jigsaw of a larger reform structure in the centralisation of services and procurement processes across all Government sectors in a bid to elicit further savings for the taxpayer.  For example, in terms of procurement processes, which have been spearheaded by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, in recent months, the reformed framework for managed print services is expected to generate savings of up to €22 million annually and a pilot project regarding e-invoicing across the public sector could lead to further millions in savings by reducing administrative and transactional costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1530">Yesterday, in a move welcomed by many, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, announced plans for a large procedural change involving a human resources shared services centre, HRSSC, consolidating administrative roles throughout all of the Civil Service while freeing up resources and staff and reducing cost of service delivery.  I believe both great progress and savings can be made with the deployment of this strategy with regard to shared services of office facilities, better resource management, control of expenditure, better service and performance delivery and, of course, monitoring.  There are clear benefits to be gained from introducing shared services in areas such as HR, payroll, ICT and finance, and we must use the flexibilities under Croke Park to ensure reform is driven and that we deliver public services in a more efficient, cost-effective way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1531">It can be difficult for both staff and the wider public to understand that while processes and structures change, even on a radical level, we have to remember that, as a Government and as a service provider, times are changing and we must evolve with them.  As a nation, there is a fear of losing the personal touch or of change in terms of reduction in the number of people or agencies providing various services.  The reality, of course, is that modern facilities allow us to do a lot more with far less, and we still have the opportunity to make savings for the taxpayer, which must be placed high on the agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1532">That is not just in the provision of local government or local services.  The same could be said, for example, of the banking sector, with the AIB chief executive giving a briefing not far from this House earlier today, when he proposed amalgamating services to provide a better product for the customer at the end of the process.  That is similar to the aim of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1533">While amalgamation means a reduction in the number of people providing a service, it does not mean the quality of the service has to suffer.  At local government level, the amalgamation of both Limerick and Tipperary councils, with the suggestion of other amalgamations to follow, presents us with a fairly rare opportunity to realise significant savings for the ratepayers in those counties as well as offering savings to the taxpayer.  To echo the comments of Deputy Heather Humphreys in regard to single managers for counties, it assists in regard to the identity of those counties in continuing to deliver services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1534">In the context of local government reform, the amalgamations of local authorities should not be viewed in isolation.  I am certain that future announcements will yield further savings as well as perhaps instilling greater confidence in the ability of local councillors and officials to deliver and to be held accountable.  While we continue to deal with the fallout from the economic crisis, we must be fully aware that the world in which we live is changing at an accelerating rate.   That is the reason I believe these changes are essential, both in terms of saving money for the Exchequer and the ability of the Government to deliver on the commitments it made in the programme for Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_584">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_1535">I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill, but I object to the manner in which the Bill is being guillotined and to the manner in which it has been presented.  I object in particular to the intention to introduce significant amendments on Committee Stage, thereby introducing an almost new Bill.  I object that this is happening with a Bill dealing with important issues such as the amalgamation of county councils.  This is wrong and is something the Government promised it would not do.  However, once again we have guillotines and significant changes being introduced to a Bill on Committee Stage by amendment.  This is being done without any real consultation with stakeholders and is certainly not best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1536">I notice some of the amendments to be introduced refer to the amalgamation of local authorities, in particular, that of north and south Tipperary County Councils and Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council.  I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear what I have to say on this.  I am concerned by the fact that although the group that recommended the amalgamation of various local authorities recommended the amalgamation of Carlow-Killkenny County Councils among others, there is no proposal in this legislation for that amalgamation.  Is the Minister looking after his own patch?  Is he looking after his own patch in the same way he looked after St. Stephen's Barracks in Kilkenny, to the detriment of Kickham Barracks in Clonmel?  He was reported on the front page of the local <i>Kilkenny People</i> making the same criticisms and comments we in Clonmel made with regard to the closure of Kickham Barracks.  He said that any closure of St. Stephen’s Barracks would be a huge blow to the local economy and would put soldiers and their families at a huge disadvantage.  He said a closure would impose hardship and mean they had to move to other locations.  I am sorry he is not here to hear me say this, but I believe that he - as many Ministers did in the past - is looking after his own patch and ensuring that Carlow-Kilkenny is looked after, to the detriment of other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1537">I say this specifically in the context of the proposed amalgamations.  If one considers the ten areas recommended for amalgamation, the amalgamation of north and south Tipperary does not strike one as the most suitable.  It involves two different economic regions, two different tourist regions and two different HSE areas.  This to my mind is not a combination that jumps out at one as being suitable because of the significant differences between the north and south of the county, differences that have not been addressed at all.  Again, it is a pity the Minister is not here to hear me say this.  It needs to be said as, unfortunately, it is a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1538">I want to address the issue of local government reform.  We now see a situation where the idea that "big" is best is on and centralisation is back on the agenda.  Anybody who considers the situation carefully knows that big is not always best nor is it always cheaper.  In the case of local authorities, big is less democratic and less responsive to local people.  Take for example the establishment of the Health Service Executive.  That body is not accountable to the public, to local public representatives and accepts no input from them or from local people at the old health committee level.  This is not an example we should follow.  The recent centralisation of the medical card system within that body is an absolute and appalling mess and is an indication once again that big is not best and centralisation is not always good nor cheapest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1539">We need local government to remain local.  We need it to respond to local people and to deliver services locally.  However, it also needs to take decisions, but it is about taking decisions as closely as possible to the level of the citizen.  The opposite of this is what is happening with this Bill and with what we understand the Minister is considering with regard to proposing the abolition of town councils.  Local public representatives and their representative organisations, such as that AMAI and LAMA, have serious concerns about this.  They believe the Minister is in the process of announcing the abolition of town councils in the near future.  What we need is more local government, not less.  We need more local services delivered, more responsibility for local people and more local democracy.  This must be done by properly funding local authorities and by giving them additional powers, not by removing them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">The suggestion that there is too much local government and that we are over represented is flawed.  The AMAI has issued a presentation which shows clearly that Ireland is not over represented by local government.  A table in its presentation indicates that population per elected councillor is significantly higher in Ireland than in 15 EU member states.  In Ireland, population per elected councillor is 2,815.  The closest to this is the United Kingdom, with 2,664 per councillor and the figure goes down to that of France, with 118 per councillor.  The principle of subsidiarity, whereby decisions should be taken at the closest possible level to the citizen is enshrined in the 1992 Maastricht treaty.  This is embodied by an active, functioning local government.  Ireland also signed up to the European Charter of Local Self-Government in 1997, which asserts the role of local government in a democratic process.    The provision of a strong and meaningful democratic forum and delivery of effective services are at the heart of local government.  However, local government needs to be properly funded and given additional powers if it is to fulfil these roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1541">I am disappointed with the manner in which this Bill is being present and the guillotine that will be used on it.  I cannot support the Bill in its current form.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_585">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1542">I welcome this Bill, which commits the Government to reforming the system of local government while maintaining an efficient service for local communities.  It is crucial that communities continue to have access to adequate services in these lean times.  The Government has made clear its desire to reform the local government sector.  We have committed to reorganising local government structures to give communities more decision making on what happens locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1543">Given the size of councils and the number of councillors involved it is clear that a significant amount of money can be saved in this area.  This Bill will decrease the number agencies and bodies which are at present under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government from 21 to 12.  It is being introduced on foot of the recommendations of the local government efficiency review group, which set out 106 recommendations for cost efficiencies and savings.  If all the recommendations were implemented the combined savings would be €500 million.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has established a review group on the implementation of the recommendations and it is expected that sizeable savings can be achieved in shared services and procurement.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is satisfied that progress is being made in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1544">Local authorities have become leaner through a reduction of 6,600 in staff numbers since 2008 and a new financial management system has been introduced.  The Croke Park agreement has played a role in the transformation of work practices and the public services reform programme has achieved combined savings of €162 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1545">The Government is committed to giving councillors more say in what happens in their local areas and rewarding efficiency and local initiatives with ring-fenced money.  We want to give communities more control over education and transport at regional and county levels.  Policy reorientation will be considered in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_1546">It is important that the level of service for the public does not deteriorate.  We need to achieve more with a lot less and through this Bill the Government is trying to reform local government to provide greater efficiencies for the public.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnthonyLawlor" eId="spk_586">
          <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</from>
          <p eId="para_1547">I welcome this Bill and the language it uses.  I have criticised Ministers previously for the language they have used in legislation.  This is the first time that the explanatory memorandum, or what I describe as the Ladybird version, is more difficult to understand than the Bill itself.  Words are clearly defined to mark out what the Bill purports to do.  For example, section 3 uses words such as "efficiency", "effectiveness" and "economy in the organisation".  These are simple words that people in the street understand.  This Government is trying to get across the message by using simple words that can be implemented easily.</p>
          <p eId="para_1548">In amalgamating local authorities I hope councils can achieve more efficiencies by coming together of their own free will to increase their bargaining power.  If three counties need to purchase vehicles, for example, they could get a better deal if they bargained collectively.  This makes more sense from a business perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1549">I welcome that the Minister is abolishing or amalgamating a number of State bodies.  I will be keeping an eye on this issue because we will be creating a new body, the local government management agency, through the amalgamation of local government computer services, the local government management services board and An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.  Everyone thinks the local government computer service is a simple board but its membership is restricted to county managers and certain officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It also happens to have sub-committees in areas such as change management, ICT and audit.  God forbid that the Minister would put in place a new body that encompasses the three boards only for us suddenly to find all these sub-committees.  That is the last thing people want to see.  Put a board in place and let it operate.  All the members of this board are county managers.  We should not make jobs for the boys.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_587">
          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_1550">The election gave this Government a strong mandate for reform.  This Bill is part of our overall objective for public sector reform in terms of agency rationalisation, local authority mergers and making substantial cuts to the number of State bodies and companies.  The reduction in the number of State agencies will bring about savings in pay and administrative costs, although the challenge will be huge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1551">The main purpose of the Bill is legislatively to underpin any exiting or new bodies created under the Local Government Acts and facilitate the reorganisation, merger or abolition of State bodies and agencies in line with the Government's commitments.  It specifically provides for the dissolution of a number of bodies established under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, as well as the transfer of functions, properties and liabilities of these bodies.  It will allow the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to finalise arrangements for the rationalisation of State agencies under its control from 21 to 12.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552">The Government has approved the amendment of the Act to provide for the establishment of appropriate management arrangements for Limerick city and county councils and north and south Tipperary county councils prior to their respective mergers in 2014.  The principal objective of this change will be to enable the same individual to be manager of more than one city or county council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553">A single agency, the local government management agency, will provide shared services for industrial relations, ICT procurement and library services for each of the 34 local authorities.  The two Limerick regeneration agencies will be dissolved.  Their roles will be replaced with one joint management arrangement for Limerick city and county council.  This is a step towards the merger of the two councils.  Transformation can be difficult but the Government has the strong political commitment and conviction to implement the reform.  Ireland has shown itself to be resilient and we pride ourselves on our adaptability.  The legislation is part of our Government's agenda to reform for the future, to ensure we provide services in a more streamlined and efficient manner and to continue to make savings wherever and whenever possible.  A strong and fit for purpose local government will be of benefit to all people of Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOReilly" eId="spk_588">
          <from>Deputy Joe O’Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_1554">The principal of the Bill, that we should rationalise services and economise where possible, is sound.  In this contemporary age of ICT, the use and availability of ICT and broadband for every function of Government and administrative situation makes the rationalisation of services a desirable possibility.  It is desirable to pool resources and share services over a range of activities, such as ICT services in local authorities, paying people and HR services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1555">By way of cautionary note, I point out that the county structure Ireland is strong, with deep historical roots.  It goes back to the time of Queen Elizabeth I and is rooted in Ireland.  I welcome and accept the sharing of services as a logical process of modernisation and rationalisation to ensure value for money for the taxpayers.  No alternative to the legislative proposals - on which I compliment the Minister, Deputy Hogan - could be contemplated or posited.  However, the idea that a county manager might manage two or three counties is unsustainable.  Even though it might seem reasonable from a theoretical, desktop situation, rivalry would exist and there would be a perception of discrimination or that one county had an advantage over another.  We must maintain management at county level but we can share services and resources.  The county structure is sufficiently strong and historical for that to be the case.  The agency dealing with computer technology, which has its origins in the mid-1970s, is anachronistic and archaic in a modern context.  It is right that it is subsumed into the normal local government structure.  It is pivotal that we get as many services as possible administered centrally through the local government structure, with public accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1556">I welcome the principles on which the Bill is based, the objectives and what will be achieved.  Ultimately, we are the custodians of the taxpayers' money and it is our duty to maximise the outcome to the advantage of the taxpayer and to eliminate waste where possible.  However, I offer a cautionary note on the strength of, and loyalty to, the county structure and how well it works.  I caution against a reduction or elimination of that structure and I humbly put my view to the Minister for consideration.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1557">I thank the Members for their contributions.  There is always a very good, informed debate on local government and Members are interested in the issues.  There will be an opportunity for further debate on further legislative measures and when the Minister announces his proposals for the reform of local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558">The Bill is relatively short but it is important to allow the Department to move forward on a number of very significant State agency rationalisations.  Many Deputies referred to the opportunity to rationalise and reduce the number of agencies.  The Minister will be able to dissolve bodies established under the 1971 Act and to dissolve An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, which was established under its own Act in 1947.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559">I did not have time earlier to recognise the good work and contribution to our communities made by the bodies established under the 1971 Act.  While the Department is reducing the number of agencies, we intend to maintain the services provided by those agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560">It is important to address the issue of the Bill's role in the amalgamation of local authority structures in Limerick and Tipperary, which were referred to by many contributors.  Tomorrow, I will introduce amendments that will enable dual management arrangements to operate in Limerick and Tipperary.  This will allow for the appointment of a single manager to both sets of authorities pending their full merger in 2014.  It will ensure there is clear and cohesive leadership of the reorganisation process in both areas.  I know more about Limerick than Tipperary but I recognise the need for that kind of leadership as we approach 2014.  More substantive legislation will be required to implement the merger of the two authorities in Limerick and Tipperary.  The situation in Waterford is under examination but no decision on any other mergers has been made at this point.  I reject Deputy Healy's criticism of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, in this regard.  We are only talking about mergers within counties, not mergers of counties.  That discussion is for another day.</p>

          <p eId="para_1562">The Bill does not provide for the establishment of the new amalgamated unitary local authorities in Limerick and Tipperary.  That will require further, separate legislation.  The Minister will bring forward wider local government proposals shortly on regional, county and sub-county structures.  The overall reform programme will also reflect other work in progress on various aspects of local government, including the merger and restructuring processes that I have referred to, the local government efficiency review implementation, local government financing, local development and local government alignment.  A wide range of policy proposals will give rise to further legislation in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1563">Regarding the Bill, the principle of a Minister in a sector such as local government having the power to establish bodies to provide shared services for local authorities is long-established and recognised by the courts.  It is even more important in today's environment that the Minister has the power, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to establish bodies to deliver shared services.  We all recognise that we want to rationalise in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1564">This Bill clearly establishes in primary legislation the principles and policies that the Minister must have regard to in establishing such bodies.  The matters that will guide the Minister are clearly set out and are aimed towards efficiency and effectiveness of operation.  There is substantial support on all sides of the House in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1565">The bodies are now effectively established under primary legislation and therefore it has not been possible to establish, on a statutory footing, the amalgamated bodies required to give full effect to the Department's agency rationalisation programme but the Bill will allow the Minister to dissolve eight bodies in total.  It is only intended to establish two new bodies.  The housing and sustainable communities agency will take over the work of the affordable homes partnership, the Centre for Housing Research and the National Building Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1566">As Deputies said, the Local Government Management Agency will take on the work of the LGCBS, LGMSB and An Comhairle Leabharlanna.  Deputy Lawlor, in particular, spoke about that area.  We all understand what is happening with the Limerick regeneration offices.  Limerick Regeneration will now report directly to the manager designate of the new unitary authority in Limerick once that person is appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1567">This has been a wide-ranging debate and there will be further opportunity tomorrow to discuss the issues.  I thank all Members who contributed to the debate and I thank the House for the prompt consideration of the Bill.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1675">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 18 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing arising from difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Deputy will be aware that mortgage holders who are in difficulty with their mortgage obligations have significant protections available to them under the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. In addition, the Department of Social Protection's mortgage interest supplement scheme also provides for direct support to mortgage holders that have had to avail of social welfare support and over 18,000 households currently avail of this benefit.  Budgeting advice is available through MABS which is also funded by the Department of Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">These existing supports are being supplemented by new measures arising from the implementation of recommendations contained in the Interdepartmental Committee's Report.  A mortgage to rent scheme involving the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and voluntary housing bodies is being piloted by a number of the banks in advance of a wider rollout.  More generally, the Central Bank has asked all lenders to submit Board approved loan modification and resolution options such as those recommended in the Inter-Departmental Committee's report as well as details on the segmentation of their mortgage portfolio by the end of May. The intention will be that banks will make proposals for each of the segmented categories and develop them into solutions for activation during the second half of this year.  Personal insolvency reform of course is also a key measure in the mortgage arrears resolution process.  As you are aware the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence published the draft heads of a Personal Insolvency Bill earlier this year and the Minister has indicated that the draft legislation will be published before the end of June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">The Central Bank, both from a consumer protection and prudential regulation perspective, has a very significant role to play in addressing the problem of mortgage arrears.  Central Bank representatives participate in a Steering Group of Senior officials to oversee and drive the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears across Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">The Deputy will also be aware that since last March, a special Government Committee focused on this issue has been meeting on a regular basis to ensure that a high priority is assigned to the delivery of the implementation of the "Keane report" recommendations across relevant Departments and agencies.  The Committee is chaired by An Taoiseach and includes all the Ministers that have a role in this broad area and will ensure action on the part of all involved in addressing this difficult issue for those households unable to meet their mortgage commitments. To aid the Committee's deliberations, the Central Bank has made presentations to the Cabinet Committee and I anticipate that this will be an ongoing engagement as Government deals with this difficult issue for those households unable to meet their mortgage commitments.</p>

          </b>asked the

         if he has given consideration to giving road hauliers a rebate on their fuel costs as is practised in other European countries; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many hauliers purchase their fuel in other European countries in which it is more cost effective to do so leading to a loss of tax revenue to the Exchequer; and if he has prepared any estimates for the potential increased revenue to the State in the case of a 20 cent per litre rebate on fuel for road hauliers.

            <p eId="para_1681">The Deputy may be aware that a working group was set up between officials of my Department, the IRHA and members of the Oireachtas.  This working group is discussing a number of issues of concern to the haulage industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">Among the issues examined by the group is an essential user's rebate system. I should point out that a fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes. In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3 as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC.   It should also be noted that under Directive 2003/96/EC the maximum permissible relief at current Mineral Oil Tax rates is actually 14.902 cent per litre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">While the haulage industry contend that there could be a potential benefit to the Exchequer due to hauliers changing their purchasing behaviour there is also a potential cost to the Exchequer given the scope and the amount of the relief permissible under the Directive.</p>

          </b>asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance noting that</b>
         the ECB has provided more than €1,000 billion to European banks at 1% for three years, his views on whether this resource would be more productively used as part of a stimulus programme of necessary public works throughout the EU to enable the unemployed to work again and to thereby kick-start economies throughout the EU.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1685">The sizeable expansion in the ECB's balance sheet since this crisis began which manifested itself most recently in the two three year repos exercises, are all designed to stabilise the European banking sector and ensure institutions across the Eurozone are in a position to continue lending into the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">As a point of clarification, the €1 trillion of lending you refer to was the gross amount of loans issued in the two recent three year operations. After refinancing, the net increase in the ECB's balance sheet was less than this. Having said that they helped contribute to an increase in liquidity provided by the ECB of nearly €600 billion between November and April.  It is impossible to directly measure the impact of these measures on lending and economic activity, as there is no counterfactual. However what we do know is that conditions would be considerably worse in the absence of these interventions by the ECB. As the Deputy may be aware, the ECB cannot lend directly to sovereign governments, it can only lend to licensed credit institutions with MFI (monetary financial institutions) status in exchange for appropriate collateral.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Governments across the Eurozone can of course raise funding on the international markets from investors who may include banks who are supported by the ECB, or funds/institutions who have borrowed from those same banks. It is a decision for individual governments whether or not to stimulate their own economies through public works projects taking into account factors such as cost and availability of funds, debt sustainability and traditional cost/benefit analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">The government is supportive of the growing calls across the Eurozone for a growth and stimulus agenda which is why we strongly argued — and secured agreement — that within our own funding programme we be allowed use a greater portion of funds derived from state asset disposals for such purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1730">At present, AIB is undergoing a significant restructuring process and as one of the two pillar banks in the domestic economy it is natural that investors will seek to have preliminary discussions with both the bank and the State in order to better understand the underlying performance and value of the AIB franchise. The 2011 transaction completed by the State with private investors in Bank of Ireland demonstrates that international money managers remain optimistic over the outlook for the Irish economy. As and when any concrete interest is expressed by external investors in making an investment in AIB it will be carefully evaluated by my staff and the bank to ensure that taxpayers' interests are protected at all times.</p>

            <p eId="para_1732">The Government remains committed to the objective in the Programme for Government to introduce a bank levy, and is working to ensure this is met during the lifetime of this Government. The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 provides for the introduction of such a levy on authorised credit institutions, to be paid into a bank resolution fund. The Act provides that all authorised credit institutions will be levied at a rate prescribed in or to be calculated in accordance with regulations made by the Minister under section 15 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">My Department is currently working on the formulation of regulations to introduce the levy. In making these regulations the Minister for Finance is required by the 2011 Act to have regard for the requirement to balance the need for the Fund to grow to an effective size with the need for the rate of contribution to be consistent with maintaining the commercial viability of credit institutions and also bearing in mind the difficulties facing the overall sector. Under the terms of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland the regulations to introduce the Resolution Fund levy on credit institutions will be approved by end September 2012. Final confirmation of the format of the Regulations will be subject to further consultation with the Governor of the Central Bank and to the extent they relate to Credit Unions with the Credit Union Advisory Committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_1735">As the Deputy is aware, the Government is committed to reviewing the arrangements that were put in place to capitalise IBRC. The purpose of this review is to determine if there is a way to reduce the overall cost to the State. Part of the capitalisation of IBRC was provided using promissory notes as consideration. The Troika has agreed to engage in this process to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">While the development in relation to the end March Promissory Note payment is a positive development, we must keep our eye on the greater benefits which would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note and also the potential improvements for the banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions. Further, it should be borne in mind that recent concerns in the Eurozone underpin the fact our problems are part of a wider European dilemma and to the need for solutions to address the Irish situation as part of an overall Eurozone/global solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments in relation to the Promissory Note repayment as an initial step to facilitate a project where, if we are successful, it will be in the medium term rather than immediately. These discussions will continue and the Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC. The ongoing discussions may also explore options to refinance the long term Government bond issued in settlement of the March 31 payment. We all want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_1739">The high earner's restriction for individuals on high incomes, who make significant use of certain specified tax reliefs, was announced in Budget 2006 and came into effect from 1 January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">The restriction works by limiting the total amount of specified reliefs that a high income individual can use to reduce his or her tax liability in any one tax year. Prior to the introduction of this restriction, such individuals, by means of the cumulative use of various tax incentive reliefs, had been able to reduce their tax liability to very low levels or to zero.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">The restriction, as introduced, was designed to ensure that individuals with adjusted income exceeding €500,000 paid an effective rate of tax of approximately 20% on that income. That objective was achieved in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Where adjusted income was between €250,000 and €500,000, a tapering system ensured that there was a graduated introduction of the restriction, with the effective rate of tax increasing towards 20% as adjusted income increased towards €500,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">In Budget 2010, changes to the restriction from the 2010 tax year were announced. Those individuals with adjusted income exceeding €400,000 will, as a result, now pay an effective income tax rate of approximately 30% on that income, while individuals will now become subject to the restriction and the associated taper, where adjusted income is €125,000 or greater and where they claim €80,000 or more in specified reliefs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">The Programme for Government included a commitment to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 30% for very high earners. The changes already made in Budget 2010 should ensure that this is achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">The report on the operation of the high earners' restriction in respect of the 2010 tax year is currently being compiled by the Revenue Commissioners. It is expected that this report will be presented to me and published on my Department's website later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">As indicated in my Budget speech last December, following the receipt of this report and analysis of its contents, I will decide whether any further change to the restriction is warranted in Budget 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_1750">Food securities trading forms part of the regulation of derivatives.  As the Deputy knows, the regulation of derivatives has been part of our discussions with the EU, and has been on the Ecofin agenda since September 2010, when the Commission published its proposal to regulate this market in the context of over-the-counter (OTC) trades.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">I can inform the Deputy that, following discussions, agreement on a final text has been reached with all of the EU institutions, subject to final technical details being clarified.  The scope of this draft Regulation covers all over-the-counter derivatives, not just food securities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">In relation to derivatives traded on exchanges, as I indicated in my last reply to the Deputy in February, Ireland already has a regulatory regime which comes from the 2004 EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which is currently being reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">The work on both OTC derivatives and the MiFID review is expected to result in a tighter regime for all derivatives, including food securities, whether traded OTC or through exchanges. The measures are intended to keep pace with trends in derivatives trading, and in line with G20 commitments.  When finalised, these EU legislative initiatives will come into force in all Member States. The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent authority in this country for the purposes of derivatives legislation.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_602">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1755">The Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Mortgage Arrears indicated that the reform of personal insolvency legislation is a central catalyst to the resolution of the mortgage arrears problem.  In particular it stated that new non-judicial debt settlement arrangements are vital to address the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence published the general scheme of a Personal Insolvency Bill for public consultation at the end of January.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Department of Justice in co-operation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is a very lengthy and complex Bill from a legal standpoint, with proposed provisions which do not currently exist in Irish law.  The Bill remains a legislative priority for the Government and publication of the Bill is the end of June.  The Minister for Justice has indicated his strong intention to commence the Second stage prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">The Deputy will also be aware that mortgage holders who are in difficulty with their mortgage obligations have significant protections available to them under the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. In addition, the Department of Social Protection's mortgage interest supplement scheme also provides for direct support to mortgage holders that have had to avail of social welfare support and over 18,000 households currently avail of this benefit.   Budgeting advice is available through the MABS which is also funded by the Department of Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">These existing supports are being supplemented by new measures arising from the implementation of recommendations contained of the Interdepartmental Committee's Report.  A mortgage to rent scheme involving the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and voluntary housing bodies is being piloted by a number of the banks in advance of a wider rollout.  More generally, the Central Bank has asked all lenders to submit Board approved loan modification and resolution options such as those recommended in the Inter-Departmental Committee's report as well as the segmentation of their mortgage portfolio by the end of May. The intention will be that banks will make proposals for each category and develop them into solutions for activation during the second half of this year.  It is not the case that the activation of these measures is dependent on the enactment of the Personal Insolvency legislation but rather they offer a framework within which agreement can be reached on a case-by-case basis between the lender and the borrower.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">The Deputy will also be aware that since last March, a special Government committee focused on this issue has been meeting on a regular basis to ensure that a high priority is assigned to the delivery of the implementation of the "Keane report" recommendations across relevant Departments and agencies.  The committee is chaired by An Taoiseach and includes all the Ministers that have a role in this broad area and will ensure action on the part of all involved in addressing this difficult issue for those households unable to their mortgage commitments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1761">The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for our EU/IMF Programme of financial assistance was signed in December 2010, and following each of the subsequent quarterly reviews by the Troika, an update of the MoU is agreed. Each update to the MoU can include the continuation of or revisions to existing commitments along with new commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">The EU/IMF Programme commitments in relation to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have been met in full to date. The commitment in relation to the Fiscal Advisory Council was initially included in the MoU of December 2010. This provided that the Fiscal Advisory Council would be established by end-June 2011. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was established at the end of June 2011 on a non-statutory basis and commenced operations the following month thereby meeting this commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">A further requirement was included in the updated Memorandum of Understanding following the third review in July 2011 to provide for the statutory establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in the Fiscal Responsibility Bill to be submitted to the Oireachtas by the end of December 2011. In light of the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact implemented by the so called "six pack" of five regulations and one directive and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union ("the Stability Treaty") it was agreed to revise the deadline for the submission of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill a number of times in subsequent missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">The most recent update to the MoU (signed in March 2012) includes a commitment, under the heading Structural Fiscal Reform, to be met by end-Q2 2012 which is:</p>

              <i>Government will introduce a Fiscal Responsibility Bill consistent with the economic governance framework at the EU level, including provisions for a medium-term budgetary framework and fiscal rules. The Bill will also put the Fiscal Advisory Council on a statutory footing, formalising the Council’s independence through clear arrangements for adequate funding over time and for Council membership, including consultation with the relevant committee of the Oireachtas for nomination, appointment, extension and termination.”</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1767">On 26 April 2012, in the context of ensuring that the public will be fully informed on the implications of the Stability Treaty and have access to all available information to enable them to make an informed decision, I published a General Scheme of a Bill to be called the Fiscal Responsibility Bill.  This sets out the draft legislation that the Government will bring before the Houses of the Oireachtas to implement key provisions of the Stability Treaty, if the Irish people decide to ratify the Stability Treaty in the forthcoming referendum.  The General Scheme includes provision for the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on a statutory basis as it will be the independent institution at national level with responsibility for monitoring compliance with the rules set out in Article 3 of the Stability Treaty.  A copy of the General Scheme was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas and it is available on the Department of Finance's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_1769">On the issue of reform of the legal profession, the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 provides the statutory framework for delivering those structural reforms undertaken in the EU/IMF Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition in the legal sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">The Legal Services Regulation Bill commenced Second Stage in the Dáil on 16th December 2011 which was completed on 23rd February 2012.  In closing the Second Stage debate Minister Shatter outlined the approaches being taken to enhancing the Bill in preparation for Committee Stage — the objective is to commence Committee Stage before the summer recess.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">On the issue of reform of the medical profession the EU/IMF programme provides for the introduction of legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors by the end of the 3rd quarter in 2011, including medical services, eliminating restrictions on the number of GPs qualifying and removing restrictions on GPs wishing to treat public patients as well as restrictions on advertising.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">Targets were met in relation to medical services:</p>

            <p eId="para_1779">The Deputy should be aware that the State met fully its obligations with regard to this year's promissory note payment to IBRC (formerly Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society). This year's payment was settled through a different mechanism than in 2011 — with a Government bond rather than a direct cash payment from the Exchequer — but nevertheless the 2012 IBRC promissory note payment was settled and so the term "non-payment" does not arise in this case. The benefits to the Exchequer from this transaction mainly relate to an improved cash position and more flexibility around funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">Under the terms of the ECOFIN Council decision of December 2010 upon entering the EU/IMF Programme, there are General Government deficit targets which we must adhere to each year. This year that deficit must be no greater than 8.6 per cent of GDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">Payment of this year's €3.06 billion IBRC promissory note instalment was not due to have any impact on the General Government deficit this year as the full €30.6 billion IBRC promissory note was included as part of the General Government deficit back in 2010. The fact that this year's payment was settled through a Government bond rather than with cash from the Exchequer does not therefore give scope for additional expenditure as this could jeopardise our budgetary targets. Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that given the very large deficits that we have been running for some years, it is important that we continue to close the gap that still exists between our expenditures and our revenues if we are to return the public finances to a sustainable position and protect future investment and growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">In terms of targeted investment in infrastructure, it is the case that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been actively engaged in identifying potential new sources of funding for projects where it makes sense and offers value for money for the State. The Government is now considering carefully what potential projects could be supported should a source of funding become available. It is likely that such investment would be focused on areas that meet the Government's key investment priorities, boost employment and help stimulate economic growth.</p>

It should be borne in mind that the recent concerns in the Eurozone underpin the fact that the solutions to address the Spanish situation, as with the Irish situation, should be seen as part of an overall Eurozone/Global solution.  We will continue to review the proposals that emerge in relation to the Spanish banks recapitalisation to ascertain if any of the proposed measures would have favourable applicability if implemented in Ireland.</p>

Any such borrowing would be carried out by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and would form part of the National Debt.  The Bank is also an important provider of funding to semi-states and the private sector, including the funding of infrastructure through Public-Private Partnerships and lending to SMEs via the banks.  In relation to capital investment projects, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a role in terms of setting the overall capital investment framework and the basic principles to be observed for the appraisal, assessment, procurement and evaluation of projects.  Individual Ministers are responsible for projects and programmes in their areas, within that overall framework.  Decisions on the funding arrangements for those projects are also the responsibility of individual departments.  Departments are obliged to seek the opinion of the National Development Finance Agency whose statutory role is to advise any State authority of what, in the opinion of the Agency, are the optimal means of financing the cost of public investment projects in order to achieve value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">Details about the funding arrangements for individual projects can be obtained directly from the relevant Department.

            <p eId="para_1795">The National Asset Management Agency is subject to a high level of public accountability compared to other commercial semi state bodies, reflecting the fact that it is managing a significant financial exposure on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.  The NAMA Act 2009 makes the Agency accountable in a number of ways, including laying its annual report and audited financial statements before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Chairman and Chief Executive are also accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees and give evidence to committees whenever required to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">In addition to its annual accounts, however, NAMA is also required to submit the Minister for Finance an Annual Statement setting out its proposed objectives for the following year, the scope of activities to be undertaken, its strategies and policies and its proposed use of resources.  NAMA is also required to report to me on a quarterly basis giving detailed information about its loans, its financing arrangements and its income and expenditure.  I am obliged to lay such reports before the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">I am advised that NAMA's accounts are comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has a permanent team of officers based in the Agency with unrestricted access to all its records and files.  The process of loan valuation and acquisition is also being audited by the European Commission.  The Management of loans by NAMA was also subject to a special report of the C&amp;AG and that will be published very soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1798">I am advised by NAMA that its Annual Report will be published within the next two months and will be a full and detailed account of its 2011 operations and results.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1803">The proposed new policy framework for personal insolvency to be set out in the Personal Insolvency Bill which the Minister for Justice and Equality plans to publish before the end of June 2012 was seen by the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on mortgage arrears as a key catalyst in dealing with the problem of mortgage arrears.  The introduction of these reforms will reinforce the Central Bank's ongoing interaction with individual lenders to enhance their Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies, the current phase of which involves the segmentation of loan books into sustainable and unsustainable categories and the development of a range of suitable options.  The legislation should encourage lenders to allocate sufficient resources and attention to negotiating, where possible, voluntary debt restructuring arrangements with individual debtors on a bilateral basis outside of the non-judicial or judicial framework.  However, it is not the case that the agreement of such restructuring arrangements is dependent on the enactment of the Personal Insolvency legislation but rather the legislation underpins a broader framework within which agreement can be reached on a case-by-case basis between the lender and the borrower.  It should be noted that the proposed introduction of both the Debt Settlement Arrangements and the Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIA) as an alternative to court based bankruptcy for over-indebted creditors should serve to support greater stability in the financial sector.  Firstly these non-judicial mechanisms are premised on both debtors and creditors obtaining a better outcome than under the reformed bankruptcy regime.  Secondly creditors avoid the administrative and financial costs of debt enforcement proceedings that are incurred through the courts process.  Thirdly creditors, by agreeing to a PIA, can avert the immediate crystallization and write-down of negative equity that might otherwise occur in bankruptcy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">A further key aspect of the new legislation is that it will carefully distinguish between individuals who can't pay as opposed to those who won't pay.  For individuals who are insolvent without any reasonable prospect of being able to repay their debts, the new legislation will allow them to rehabilitate their financial situation over a defined period.  Any losses that creditors must bear as a consequence will not be caused by the new legislation but by the fact of the individual's insolvency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">The general position in relation to the capital situation of the Irish covered banks is that these institutions were subject to a robust, rigorous and independent Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) in March 2011 by the Central Bank and by international standards, such as the EBA, the Irish banks remain well capitalized.  As a result, in July 2011, some €24 billion was invested in the Irish covered banks to cover losses from asset portfolios and deleveraging.  On the basis of lifetime projections by BlackRock, losses were assumed on the residential mortgage books of between €5.7 billion and €9 billion under base and stress case scenarios over the 2011-13 period under PCAR.  For the latest available period of data from the Central Bank, the mortgage arrears numbers lie between the Central Bank's base and stress tests projections.</p>

            <p eId="para_1807">The Deputy will be aware that, under Section 122 of the NAMA Act, a participating institution may dispute the total portfolio acquisition value of all bank assets acquired from it by NAMA if it believes that the aggregate market value of the acquired portfolio exceeds the total portfolio acquisition value.  It may do this after service of a completion notice by NAMA.  I understand that the EU Commission is currently engaged in an audit of the valuation of the loans transferred in the final Tranches.  NAMA proposes to serve a completion notice on each institution after the Commission has indicated its approval of the valuation of all loan transfers from that institution.  The timing of completion of that audit is a matter for the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">When NAMA issues completion notices to the institutions, it will then be a matter for the Boards of the institutions to determine whether they wish to formally dispute the total portfolio acquisition value as finally approved by the Commission.  If they decide to do so, the valuation appeal process specified in Sections 119-127 of the Act is thereby activated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">All of the participating institutions have submitted appeals to individual loan valuations under Section 121 but this section does not require any adjudication on valuations.  The significance of Section 121 appeals is that if, in aggregate, the disputed valuations total more than 12.5% of the total portfolio acquisition value, the PI thereby qualifies to make an appeal under Section 122.  The position is that to date no participating institution has yet disputed the total portfolio acquisition value of the portfolio acquired by NAMA.</p>

            <p eId="para_1811">As the Deputy is aware, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the period 2011-2014.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.  The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both banks achieved their 2011 targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">I should stress again that the Government has imposed targets for the amounts of credit to be sanctioned by the banks- the targets are not for actual lending as the banks do not have control over when or if sanctioned credit is actually drawn down.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">Data provided by the Central Bank indicates that the drawdown of new lending by non-financial SMEs from credit institutions in Ireland was €3.1 billion in 2011.  For the Deputy's information, the relevant statistics for credit made available to small business are accessible at: <i>http://www.centralbank.ie/polstats/stats/cmab/Documents/ie_Table_A.14.1_Credit_
Advanced_to_Irish_Resident_Small_and_Medium_Sized_Enterprises.xls</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1814">In relation to the public interest directors, the position is that any director appointed to the board of the covered institutions, whether under the CIFS scheme or otherwise, is subject to the requirements of company law in the discharge of his or her responsibilities as a company director.  As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself.  These are the director's fiduciary responsibilities.  Public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">However, in terms of my Department engaging with the banks on the issue of SME credit, the Deputy should note that the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, subsequently analyses the plan and meets the banks to discuss the content.  The banks also meet with my Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.  The banks provide my Department and the CRO with monthly returns outlining their SME lending figures, broken down at a sectoral and regional level.  The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">I should stress however that the Relationship Frameworks with the banks provide that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions including with respect to pricing and lending decisions.  These frameworks are published on my Department's website at <i>http://banking.finance.gov.ie/presentations-and-latest-documents/</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1820">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF), the establishment of which was announced by the Government in September 2011. The SIF will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the SIF will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy.    I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, as Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, that the NPRF announced in November 2011 a commitment of €250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to €1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects. Marketing of this fund in Ireland by Irish Life Investment Managers and abroad by AMP Capital commenced in the first quarter of 2012. Normally the period from commencement of marketing of an investment fund targeting illiquid assets to closure of financial commitments by investors in such a fund can extend up to one year. In parallel, AMP Capital, the infrastructure manager of the fund, has commenced a process of building a pipeline of appropriate investment opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">The NPRF has also committed €450 million to finance the national roll out of domestic water meters.   In addition, the NPRF is actively supporting the development of the market for venture capital in Ireland through its continued participation in Innovation Fund Ireland in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.  On 15 March 2012, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation announced the commencement of the second call for expressions of interest from appropriately qualified international venture capital managers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">Further involvement of the NPRF in the SIF is expected to require the amendment of the investment policy of the NPRF, which is set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, which is the Manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary amendments to the legislation and I expect to bring forward proposals for amending legislation as soon as possible once that work is completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1824">The pension fund levy is a temporary stamp duty charge on the assets of pension funds which will be in place for 4 years in order to fund the Jobs Initiative introduced last year. There are very few exemptions from the levy and this, in part, explains why it was possible to introduce it at a relatively low rate of 0.6%.  For example, the levy does not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent.   The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, who are chargeable in respect of the levy have the option under the legislation to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. Where this option is taken the funding position of the scheme would not be impacted on foot of the levy. There may also be other options open to scheme trustees for dealing with the impact of the levy such that the funding position of the pension scheme would not be affected. However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">I have no plans to amend the pension fund levy arrangements in the manner suggested by the Deputy. However, in common with other tax measures, its operation will be reviewed by me in the context of next year's Budget and Finance Bill.</p>

NAMA incurred a heavy burden of cost in its first year arising predominantly from due diligence costs associated with the acquisition of loans and costs associated with the Agency's establishment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">The due diligence costs were required to be undertaken to ensure that loan valuations were in line with the valuation methodology approved by the EU Commission. It was important that the consideration paid by NAMA for its acquired loans was in line with EU approval and accordingly it was necessary to undertake detailed legal, property and loan due diligence to ensure that loan acquisition prices were fairly and rigorously determined. Costs were also incurred in creating a new organisation from scratch capable of meeting the complex challenges set for the Agency. These costs are not recurring.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">I am satisfied that NAMA, which is now fully established and which has completed its loan acquisitions and valuations, is operating and delivering according to its statutory objectives in a cost effective and efficient manner.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_617">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1834">The Government is intensifying its efforts to address the mortgage arrears problem and a special temporary Government committee, chaired by An Taoiseach, is now meeting on a regular basis to prioritise this work agenda. Government is proceeding on the basis of the recommendations of the "Keane Report" which indicated that a blanket approach to debt forgiveness is not an appropriate or affordable response to the problem of significant mortgage difficulty. The Government's approach on mortgage arrears is to target assistance and relief to those mortgage holders who, through no fault of their own, are experiencing real and genuine difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments and to assist those mortgage holders, as far as possible and appropriate, to remain in their home if desired.   A number of measures are being advanced across a number of Departments to assist mortgage holders experiencing most difficulty including personal insolvency reform, the "mortgage to rent" initiative, direct engagement with mortgage lenders by the Central Bank as part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategy (MARS) process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">Personal insolvency reform is a central plank of the Government's overall agenda to tackle the mortgage arrears problem — while this work will take a little while longer that originally envisaged, due to the complex legal and drafting issues, it remains a legislative priority for Government and the intention is to publish the Bill before the end of June. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence also indicated that the strong intention is to commence second stage of the Bill before the Oireachtas summer recess.</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">As the Deputy is aware, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the period 2011-2014.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets. The pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The banks provide my Department and the CRO with monthly returns outlining their SME lending figures, broken down at a sectoral and regional level. The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by my Department.  I should stress however that the Relationship Frameworks with the banks provide that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions including with respect to pricing and lending decisions. These frameworks are published on my Department's website at <i>http://banking.finance.gov.ie/presentations-and-latest-documents/</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1840">While I regret the closure of any bank branches, the Deputy will no doubt  appreciate that the provision of services by banks, including the location of branches, is a commercial decision for the banks.  The Deputy might wish to note that there is a provision in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code which imposes certain obligations on banks which have decided to close, merge or move a branch in a given location.  The relevant provision states: <i>Where a credit institution plans to close, merge or move a branch, it must notify the Central Bank immediately and provide at least two months notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements.  The credit institution must ensure all business of the branch is properly completed prior to the closure, merger or move, or alternatively inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided.  The wider community must be informed, in advance, through notification in the local press.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1841">The advance notification requirement is designed to give existing consumers the necessary time to choose another credit institution. On the issue more generally, credit unions provide important financial services to members in rural and disadvantaged areas. The Government established the Commission on Credit Unions on 31 May 2011 to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for credit union. The Commission presented its report to me on 31 March 2012 and published it on 18 April 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">The Commission recognised the important role that credit unions can play in promoting financial inclusion and engaging in social lending to members from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Report stated that the provision of basic payment accounts could be a good strategic fit for credit unions given their community roots and not-for-profit ethos and recommends that credit unions take a more prominent role in developing and maintaining social lending and social finance schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">A report setting out a Strategy for Financial Inclusion was published on my Department's website in June 2011. The main operational recommendation from the report was the proposed introduction of a "basic payment account". An implementation group, which is chaired by my Department, has been established to manage the implementation process and a basic payment account is expected to be rolled out in June 2012 on a pilot basis in three locations in the State. Following an analysis of the outcome of the pilot, it is expected that the basic payment account will be rolled out nationally in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">It was noted in the Strategy for Financial Inclusion report that the post office network has the potential to play a key role in the delivery of basic payment accounts. However the delivery of a basic payment account by the post office network is contingent on suitable systems, operational, commercial and governance arrangements being in place to facilitate such a process. I am advised that this is one of the many issues which will be considered in the context of the pilot programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1846">Finance Ministers are regularly updated on developments in Members States, including at the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings.  In this context, I would point out that the Spanish authorities are keeping their colleagues at EU level informed of developments.   It is commonly acknowledged that the Spanish banking system as a whole remains vulnerable to market tensions given its exposure to problematic real estate and construction assets, the weak economic outlook and large refinancing needs.  On the basis of their assessments, a number of rating agencies have recently downgraded the credit ratings of several Spanish banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1847">It is fair to say that the Spanish authorities have taken a number of positive steps to address market concerns regarding the financial sector.  For instance, an independent audit of banks will be undertaken in order to boost transparency and definitively address doubts about the valuation of bank assets.  In addition, banks are being obliged to set aside additional capital to cover potential losses on the riskiest assets.  While the Spanish authorities have taken a number of positive measures to address the situation it will take time to deliver the necessary results.  Uncertainty is likely in the interim period, which may be reflected in elevated market tension.</p>

            <p eId="para_1849">The Government is committed to ensuring a continuing level of investment in Ireland in the interests of boosting economic activity and generating employment. It believes that the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) can make a significant contribution to that objective through its involvement in the Strategic Investment Fund and through investment opportunities in Ireland such as the new Irish infrastructure investment fund, as well as through commercial investment in projects in this country, such as the €450 million the Fund has committed to finance the national roll out of domestic water meters, and the Fund's continuing participation in Innovation Fund Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1850">The resulting greater concentration of investment in Ireland on the part of the NPRF is expected to require the amendment of the NPRF's investment policy, which is set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, as the Manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary amendments to the legislation and I expect to bring forward proposals for amending legislation as soon as possible once that work is completed.  It should be noted that the funds in the Discretionary Portfolio are not all readily accessible. The NPRF Commission has legally committed €1.2 billion to various fund investments, of which over €800 million is for investment in Ireland. The €800 million includes a commitment to provide funding on a commercial basis for the roll-out of the water metering programme subject to certain pre-conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">The establishment of the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) was announced by the Government in September 2011. The SIF will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund towards productive investment in the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the Fund will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy. It will comprise a series of sub-funds targeted at commercial investment in critical areas of the Irish economy, including infrastructure, venture capital and provision of long-term capital for SMEs. The NPRF will take a lead role in the development and implementation of each sub-fund.</p>

It is in the general interest that mortgage lending must be undertaken on a sustainable and prudential basis by financial institutions and conform fully with regulatory requirements both in relation to the financial institution itself and also the safeguarding of the consumer's interests.  I should also stress that the Relationship Frameworks with the banks provide that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions including with respect to pricing and lending decisions.

            <p eId="para_1855">To date, Ireland has completed six successful quarterly reviews with the Troika, the most recent review mission taking place last month.  Last year, Ireland comfortably met all fiscal targets agreed under the Programme, including all cumulative end-quarter Exchequer primary balance and Central Government net debt targets as well as the annual General Government deficit target. Reviews to date have been viewed positively by the Troika. This year, although there are a number of pressure points, I am confident, based on fiscal data for the first four months of the year, that we can adhere to the 8.6% of GDP General Government deficit target based on the Budget day measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">The European Commission recently released its Spring 2012 European Economic Forecast. It showed that while Ireland's GDP growth of 0.7% in 2011 was lower than the 1.5% growth recorded in the Eurozone as a whole, the situation will be reversed in 2012, with Ireland again projected to post growth albeit modest, while Eurozone GDP is forecast to fall by 0.3%. In terms of budgetary indicators, while Ireland's underlying deficit of 9.4% of GDP in 2011 was well above the Eurozone equivalent, it fell by 1.5% of GDP last year and was well within the limit set by the ECOFIN Council in December 2010. It is also projected to decrease markedly over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">It is my view that any development that enhances certainty and stability for the Irish economy is to be welcomed. In this regard a positive outcome of the forthcoming referendum will, I believe give confidence to international investors who continue to invest heavily in the Irish economy as evidenced by the FDI announcements already this year. Our firm commitment is to deliver employment opportunities for the Irish people and in order to deliver this, Government needs to enhance our budgetary framework and promote the right climate for business to prosper. Similarly, I believe our return to the international sovereign debt markets will be aided by increased certainty and security that a positive outcome in the upcoming referendum will deliver.</p>

Ultimately, the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of IL&amp;P, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability.  Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in IL&amp;P, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF. Relationship Frameworks have now been specified that clearly define the nature of the relationship between me and each of the covered institutions. Those Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at: <i>http://banking.finance.gov.ie/presentations-and-latest-documents/</i>.  It should be noted however that PTSB recently announced a 0.5pc reduction in its standard variable rate for residential mortgage customer effective from 14 May 2011 and it now stands at 4.69% bringing the rate more in line with those charged by other institutions in the Irish mortgage market.</p>

            <p eId="para_1861">The original Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been updated considerably since it was signed in December 2010. It was first updated following the combined first and second reviews in April 2011, and it has been updated after each subsequent quarterly review.  Each update to the MoU can include the continuation of, or revisions to, existing commitments along with new commitments.   Taking this into account, the relevant commitments are those due for the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 amounting to 19 in total. Of these, all commitments were met with one exception. In the case of bank recapitalisation, the commitment was to complete this by end February 2011.  However, the then Minister for Finance, the late Mr Brian Lenihan T.D., decided that, as the general election had been called, it would be inappropriate to implement the condition at that time, and it was accordingly deferred with the agreement of the Troika. The bank recapitalisation was completed, following a rigorous PCAR stress test, by July 2011, at a cost considerably below that initially envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">The amendments of the MoU following the combined 1st and 2nd review, included changes to take account of the newly elected Government's policy priorities. Among the changes made were the reversal of the cut to the minimum wage, agreement on the Jobs Initiative, the end of transfers of sub €20 million loans to NAMA.  In addition, the commitments in respect of fiscal consolidation for 2012 and 2013 were also amended to take account of Government priorities.  As the Deputy will be aware, our programme implementation record has been strong.  We have met all of our commitments to date on time, amounting to over 100 actions, including the deferred banking recapitalisation target.</p>

            <p eId="para_1864">The illegal smuggling of cigarettes and other tobacco products and the illicit selling of these products is a problem for many tax jurisdictions throughout the world.   Ireland  has a longstanding  policy, primarily because of health concerns and also for budgetary reasons, of high tobacco taxation, and this makes this State  a particularly attractive market for tobacco smugglers. Easy access to Ireland via cheap flights from countries with significantly lower tobacco taxes  accentuates the attractiveness of Ireland for criminals involved in the illegal importation and sale of tobacco.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products.   They attach a high priority to this area, and they continuously review their response to the problem and their effectiveness in tackling the illicit tobacco trade.  The strategy employed by Revenue to tackle the illicit tobacco products trade is multi-faceted. It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Since mid-2010, Revenue has conducted a series of nationwide intensive tobacco "blitz"-type operations, concentrating additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at selected inland retail points, including markets, for the purpose of identifying and seizing illicit tobacco products. To date, Revenue has conducted ten such national tobacco "blitz" operations resulting in the seizure of over 35.2m cigarettes and 1,790 kgs of tobacco. These intensive operations are of course additional to Revenue's ongoing day-to-day operations targeting illicit tobacco product.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">Revenue also carries out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations. Revenue both provides and receives intelligence from other Customs Administrations and works closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in its efforts to tackle the illicit sale of tobacco at an international level. This international cooperation and sharing of intelligence and expertise plays an important role in combating illegal tobacco smuggling on a global level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">In 2011, a total of 109m cigarettes with a retail value of €46m and 11,158 kgs of tobacco with a retail value of €4m were seized by Revenue.  In addition to this Revenue has obtained one hundred and one convictions relating to cigarette smuggling, with fines of €136,300 imposed and thirty custodial sentences, of which twenty were suspended. There were a further fifty-seven convictions relating to the sale of unstamped tobacco products with fines of €115,850 imposed and thirteen custodial sentences of which seven were suspended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">In 2012 to date a total of 50m cigarettes with a retail value of €22m and 1,835 kgs of tobacco with a retail value of €0.7m have been seized by Revenue.  In addition to this Revenue has obtained twenty-eight convictions relating to cigarette smuggling, with fines of €47,250 imposed and twelve custodial sentences, of which four were suspended. There were a further thirty-one convictions relating to the sale of unstamped tobacco products with fines of €66,100 imposed and six custodial sentences of which six were suspended.</p>

            <p eId="para_1871">Following the publication of the De Larosière Report (2009), a new supervisory architecture for financial services in the European Union came into operation from January 1st 2011, namely the European Systemic Risk Board and three European Supervisory Authorities.   The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is designed to put a regime in place to monitor and assess risks to the stability of the financial system as a whole ("macro-prudential supervision"). The ESRB will provide early warning of systemic risks that may be building up and, where necessary, recommendations for action to deal with these risks. To achieve its role the ESRB will have the power to issue non-binding recommendations and warnings to Member States (including the national supervisors) and to the European Supervisory Authorities. It will receive secretarial and technical support from the ECB.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">Three new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) have been established dealing with the banking (European Banking Authority), insurance and pensions (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) and securities (European Securities and Markets Authority) sectors. The new Authorities took over the roles of the three committees of Supervisors (CEBS, CEIOPS and CSER).</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">These new Authorities will play a key role in ensuring that there is better co-ordination between supervisors in situations where a financial institution might be operating on a cross-border basis within the EU. They will also be required to ensure that EU financial services'legislation is being implemented in a more uniform manner across Member States and, in that regard, will develop a single rule-book to ensure a more harmonised approach by supervisors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1874">When these bodies were established, it was proposed that the European Parliament and the Council would examine the Regulation establishing the ESRB, following a report from the Commission, and shall determine whether the mission and organisation of the ESRB need to be reviewed by 17 December 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1875">Similarly, in relation to the three European Supervisory Authorities, the European Commission shall publish a general report on the experience acquired as a result of the operation of the Authorities by 2 January 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">It would be premature to comment on the need for further regulatory amendments at this stage in advance of these reviews.</p>

            <p eId="para_1878">The position is that any future changes to the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 will be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.   The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably under the social welfare code than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received in such benefits if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the granting of tax credits based on the civil status of the claimant.  A person who is single is entitled to a basic personal credit of €1,650 and this is doubled to €3,300 for a married couple or civil partners who are jointly assessed.  Should the couple choose separate treatment or single assessment, each individual is entitled to a personal credit of €1,650.  A cohabiting couple where both partners are working also get, in total, the same tax credits as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership (i.e. €3,300).</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">Married couples or civil partners can transfer tax credits and tax bands between the individuals, and this is of benefit where one of the individuals earns less that the 20% tax threshold of €32,800 or where one of the individuals has no income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1882">However, cohabitants are treated as separate and unconnected individuals for the purpose of income tax and, accordingly, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.</p>

            <p eId="para_1884">As the Deputy is aware the bank reports its progress twice a year in the public domain by way of its Interim and Annual Report and Accounts. The most recent Annual Report and Accounts for 2011 were released at the end of March 2012. This provides the most up to date information on the operations of IBRC and a copy of this is available on the Bank's website or through its Corporate Affairs function. The bank continues to work towards wind down by 2020 as agreed in the EC Restructuring and work out Plan for Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited and Irish Nationwide Building Society. The bank is currently ahead of target in the work out plan.  The Deputy is also aware the Government is committed to reviewing the arrangements that were put in place to capitalise IBRC. The purpose of this review is to determine if there is a way to reduce the overall cost to the State. Part of the capitalisation of IBRC was provided using promissory notes as consideration.

The Troika has agreed to engage in this process to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate etc.    While the development in relation to the end March Promissory Note payment is a positive development we must keep our eye on the greater benefits which would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note and also the potential improvements for the banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions. Further it should be borne in mind that recent concerns in the Eurozone underpin the fact our problems are part of a wider European dilemma and to the need for solutions to address the Irish situation as part of an overall Eurozone/global solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments in relation to the Promissory Note repayment as an initial step to facilitate a project where, if we are successful, it will be in the medium term rather than immediately. These discussions will continue and the Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC. The ongoing discussions may also explore options to refinance the long term Government bond issued in settlement of the March 31 payment. We all want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU. A decision in relation to the publication of the technical paper will be made once the paper is completed and subject to normal commercial sensitivities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1890">I meet with my EU and euro area colleagues on a regular basis, where we exchange views on a range of issues, including the need to boost growth in Europe.  My view is that measures to boost economic growth can play an important role in addressing the current crisis in the EU.  Indeed I would point out that the Taoiseach has consistently sought to have growth moved up the European agenda, and I note that this evening the EU Heads of State or Government will have an informal exchange of views on how to boost growth in Europe in advance of the formal European Council meeting in June.  It is also worth noting that implementing policies to boost growth in the euro area is one of the key parts of the ‘five-point strategy' to tackle the crisis agreed by the euro area Heads of State or Government last October.   My view is that there are a number of ways in which growth rates could be raised in the EU.  For instance, implementing structural reforms can have a positive effect in terms of boosting the rate of growth in many Member States and I believe that pursuing such policies within the EU is essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1891">In addition, there are calls in some quarters for fiscal measures to stimulate growth in the short term.  A number of considerations arise in this regard.  For instance, I would point out that fiscal sustainability and measures to promote economic growth are not necessarily incompatible.  At the same time, for those Member States subject to market pressures, it is clear that these have little, if any, room for budgetary manoeuvre.  It goes without saying, however, that consolidation in these Member States should be pursued in a manner which is as growth-friendly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1892">It is also important to bear in mind that additional public sector borrowing designed to stimulate the economy in the short-term could increase public indebtedness.  This may well act as a restraint on medium term economic growth, thus having a counter-productive impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">Having said this, I should also mention that it is open to Member States to access funds from the European Investment Bank for infrastructure needs and other investment spending that will boost growth.  The Bank has been a valuable source of finance for Ireland for PPPs, the commercial semi-state sector and SMEs in particular.  I might add that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself met senior officials of the Bank last week to discuss the current pipeline of projects and explore other possibilities for accessing funds.  Finally, I believe there is scope to ensure that EU structural funds are better focussed on competitiveness, growth and jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1922">The Central Bank has informed me that their independent loan loss exercise, conducted by BlackRock Solutions ("BRS"), as part of the Financial Measures Programme 2011 ("FMP") and the Prudential Capital Assessment Review ("PCAR") was used to inform the capital requirements of the PCAR banks. The loan losses assumed by BRS were on the basis of nominal expected losses which banks might incur under base and adverse macro-economic scenarios over a three year horizon and assumed significant levels of collateral repossession. However, loan loss provisions recognised in the financial statements of the banks are based on the incurred loss approach (actual loss outcomes based on accounting rules) rather than on an expected loss approach.    The Central Bank published in December 2011 new Impairment Provisioning and Disclosure guidelines which required the Covered Institutions to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1923">1. Recognise their incurred loan losses as early as possible within the context of International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS");</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1924">2. Adopt a more conservative approach to the measurement of impairment provisions across all loan portfolios; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1925">3. Significantly improve the number and granularity of their asset quality and credit risk management disclosures which will enhance users understanding of their asset quality profiles and credit risk management practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">The Central Bank considers that the level of loan loss provisions at end-2011 is a result of both increasing arrears and the more conservative approach to impairment provisioning which has resulted in a front-loading of provisions. Notwithstanding the additional and significant provisions recognised in 2011 financial statements, loan arrears on aggregate remain within the PCAR 2011 stress case parameters.</p>

            <p eId="para_1942">I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 58, 61 and 89 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">Projected economic growth rates for Ireland were revised downwards in the recent Stability Programme Update (SPU) predominantly with regard to this year but also marginally in respect of next year. Other Member States have also been subject to downward revisions to their forecast growth rates in the recent EU Commission's Spring forecasts and this has been accounted for in the assumptions underpinning Ireland's recent SPU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1944">The end-April Exchequer Returns illustrate that tax revenues were €370 million (3.5%) ahead of profile with income tax, VAT and Corporation tax all performing solidly. This demonstrates the robustness of the Budget day forecasts and gives me confidence that we are on course to meet our targets. We must bear in mind, however, that we have only four months Exchequer data to hand and there are large tax revenue targets to meet over the course of the year, including for May.</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">While total net-voted expenditure was 2% ahead of target in the first four months of the year with spending pressures evident in the areas of Health and Social Protection, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform impressed upon all his Cabinet colleagues the importance of actively managing spending within agreed limits. This is essential if budgetary targets, both on an Exchequer and General Government basis, are to be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">Overall at this point, I am confident that our fiscal targets can continue to be met. The projections set out in the SPU, which are consistent with the consolidation amounts set out in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement and Budget 2012, envisage that all fiscal targets will be met over the forecast horizon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">However, I must stress that the perennial risks associated with economic and budgetary forecasting apply and particularly so in such uncertain economic and financial circumstances. As ever, my Department will maintain a close eye on emerging economic and budgetary developments as the year progresses and will keep me informed in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1949">As required under the Directive 2003/96/EC, a full relief from Mineral Oil Tax, including the carbon charge component of the tax, applies to oil used for sea navigation, including sea fishing.   In the Finance Act 2012, I introduced a deduction in respect of the carbon charge component of the Mineral Oil Tax on marked diesel used by farmers in the course of their farming trade. Under this measure, farmers are allowed a deduction in computing their farming profits or losses, for the amount of additional carbon charge that they incur on purchases of marked diesel, following the increase in the rate of tax on certain fuels from 1 May 2012. This new deduction is in addition to the existing deduction for Mineral Oil Tax included in the cost of marked diesel used in the course of the farming trade. The Deputy may be aware that a working group was set up between officials of my Department, the IRHA and members of the Oireachtas.  This working group is discussing a number of issues of concern to the haulage industry. Among the issues examined by the group is an essential user's rebate system. I should point out that a fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes. In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3 as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC  .</p>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, of the introduction of a new 48% rate would be of the order of €490 million. However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.   This figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2009, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2012.

These allowances took into account expected operating income and expenditure and were reflective of the macro-scenarios.   Whilst the PCAR was based on a three year horizon, capital buffers were also included for amongst other things, post-2013 capital requirements, including for example additional loan losses not absorbed by reserves that will be generated in the financial year's post-2013.</p>

Indeed, the figures published yesterday by the OECD show</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">GDP growth of 0.6 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent next year, broadly in line with those presented in the SPU.   There are, of course, risks to the economic outlook. A number of downside and upside risks were identified in the SPU and remain valid at this juncture. Given the current heightened uncertainty, my Department is closely monitoring the economic situation and the</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">risks to its growth forecasts, and will continue to do so over the coming weeks and months.  The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth. According to the preliminary estimates from   the CSO, GDP contracted on a quarterly basis in the third and fourth quarters of last year. While disappointing, this was not unexpected given the heightened uncertainty and weak external environment in the second half of last year. In this context, it should be borne in mind that a number of other countries saw a contraction in activity in the third and fourth quarters of 2011.  It is generally believed that the economy grew again in the first quarter of 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1974">Ireland strongly supports the European Union's efforts to work with and encourage the parties to the Middle East peace process to reach a comprehensive settlement based on a two-state solution, in which Israel and a State of Palestine will coexist side by side in peace and co-operation with each other and their neighbours in the region.  In our view, this is the only way the long-term security, prosperity and dignity of both Palestinians and Israelis can be assured.  In addition to the support we have lent at EU level, we have pressed this view directly in our bilateral relations with the parties, notably during my visit to the region in January of this year.  Ireland's EU Presidency in 2013 will be informed by the values and priorities of Irish foreign policy.  Contributing to the search for a lasting settlement of the Middle East conflict is a major priority and, as Presidency, we will be doing everything possible to support and encourage the EU's efforts in that direction.  As the Deputy will be aware, however, the Lisbon Treaty places CFSP issues such as this under the co-ordination and direction of High Representative Ashton and the External Action Service.  There is no longer any direct role to be played by the rotating Presidency.  We will, however, use the influence available to us to support and promote the EU's vital work in this area, working closely with our Council colleagues and with the relevant official structures.</p>

Where it occurs, retired staff are usually re-engaged on a pension abatement basis, which means in effect that they continue to receive their pensions and are paid correspondingly reduced salaries by the Department.

            <p eId="para_2025">I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 91 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2026">As have been said on many occasions, macroeconomic forecasting is not an exact science. Growth forecasts are subject to ongoing revisions irrespective of what institution — domestic or international — is conducting the exercise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2027">My Department's latest economic forecasts are set out in the 2012 Stability Programme Update (SPU), which was published on April 27. GDP is projected to grow by 0.7 per cent this year, with growth of 2.2 per cent foreseen for next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">These forecasts take account of the preliminary national accounts estimates for the third and fourth quarters of last year, along with the preliminary 2011 estimate and other information that became available between Budget time and late April.</p>
            <p eId="para_2029">My Department's view that economic activity will expand again this year, and strengthen next year, is shared by other forecasters, both domestic and international. Indeed, the figures published yesterday by the OECD assume GDP growth of 0.6 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent next year, which are broadly in line with those presented in the SPU. At present, the range of GDP growth forecasts for 2012 extends from 0.5 per cent (the consensus) to 0.9 per cent (the ESRI), with the Department of Finance's projection in the middle. The Department's growth forecast for next year is also roughly mid-way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2030">The growth forecasts set out in the SPU remain valid at this time. That is not to say that there are not risks. There clearly are. A number of downside and upside risks were identified in the SPU and remain valid at this juncture. Given the current heightened uncertainty, my Department is closely monitoring the economic situation and the risks to its growth forecasts, and will continue to do so over the coming weeks and months.</p>

            <p eId="para_2032">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that underpayments of Income Tax have arisen in respect of the persons who are the subject of this question, for the years 2010 and 2011. The underpayments arose due to an administrative error, which resulted in the issue of incorrect tax credit certificates to their employers. These certificates granted the individuals additional tax credits that they were not in fact entitled to.   Revenue have apologised for this error, and have agreed to spread the collection of the underpayment over three years commencing in January 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_2034">I, as Minister for Finance have no statutory role in relation to the premium, charges or fees for life protection policies. These are commercial decisions for the various insurers themselves. However, the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code contains provisions which impose obligations on regulated entities, including those offering life protection policies, in relation to the disclosure of charges. Regulated entities are required to make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the consumer. In addition, the 2001 Life Assurance (Disclosure of Information) Regulations contain requirements for product disclosure, including the disclosure of intermediary remuneration.</p>

        <b> Deputy Sean Fleming</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         if he will re-examine the VAT legislation with a view to making changes to eliminate the situation whereby certain tour operators are having to pay VAT twice on the same product for example, operators who provide a package for premiership league matches in the UK have to pay VAT in the UK on hotel rooms and match tickets which they cannot reclaim either in the UK or in Ireland and also have to pay VAT of 23% on their margin in Ireland, part of which package has already incurred VAT in the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2154">Provisions covering the Travel AgentsMargin Scheme are contained in Section 88 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010. This scheme, which is provided for in Articles 306 to 310 of the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, was introduced with effect from 1 January 2010. Detailed discussions with the travel industry were carried out prior to the introduction of the scheme which is a standard EU-wide Scheme in operation in most Member States of the EU.   The scheme deals with the activities carried on by travel agents who act in the capacity of a principal when supplying certain travel services such as transport, accommodation, etc, which they have bought in from third parties for onward supply to travellers. Travel agents covered by the scheme are liable to VAT on their margin on the services provided rather than the full consideration they receive in respect of the supply of these services.  For example, a travel agent acting as principal in arranging visits to the UK will pay UK VAT at 20% on hotel accommodation and event tickets and incur a zero UK VAT-rate on transport.  The travel agent will then pay Irish VAT at 23% only on the margin, that is, the difference between his income from travellers and his expenses in buying in the services (accommodation, tickets, transport).  None of the constituents that make up the income from the traveller is subject to VAT more than once.</p>
            <p eId="para_2155">The nature of the scheme means that the travel agent only has an obligation to account for VAT on the margin in the country where the agent is established.  The travel agent has no further VAT obligations in places where the travel services are supplied. The travel agent cannot recover any VAT charged when he/she purchases the travel services but this is because VAT is only accounted for on the margin when the services are supplied on to the traveller. Travel agents, like other traders, can recover VAT on deductible overheads (electricity, heating, stationary) incurred by them in connection with their taxable supplies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2156">The margin scheme has benefits for a travel agent in terms of complying with their VAT obligations.  In the absence of the scheme the travel agent may have compliance obligations across many Member Sates of the EU which would place significant administrative burdens on them.</p>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no "Revenue rules" that distinguish employers and contractors.  However, as to the distinction between an employee and a self-employed contractor, whether an individual is engaged under either a contract of service (i.e. an employee) or a contract for service (i.e. self-employed) is not a choice but rather a question of fact and of general law.   Regardless of how the parties to an engagement may describe themselves, all the possible factors (including written, oral and implied details) that bear on the relationship between the parties must be examined, given their proper weight and a decision made on their overall effect.</p>

I am further advised that the organisation currently has sanction to fill five permanent clerical officer posts in Limerick from the Public Service Resource Panel in the first instance.  This panel comprises staff from other Public Service Bodies who are available for redeployment. It is also anticipated that there will be some limited temporary recruitment required to assist with peak business activity and to facilitate staff availing of the shorter working year. These temporary posts are for periods of ten weeks or less. In the event that these requirements cannot be facilitated from the Public Service Resource Panel, the posts may be filled by open recruitment through the Public Appointments Service.</p>

            <p eId="para_2217">Last year, the economy expanded by 0.7 per cent, the first year of growth since 2007.  However, in order to make inroads into the unacceptably high level of unemployment, the growth rate will have to pick-up.  This will require further improvements in competitiveness.  In addition, sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for economic growth and we must therefore correct our excessive deficit by 2015.  Finally, we need to be sure that we have a banking system which is capable of supporting the economy.  These are the broad areas being addressed by Government and progress is being made.   For instance, I think it's fair to say that there are tentative signs of an improvement in labour market conditions.  The latest data show that employment increased by 0.6 per cent (the equivalent of 10,000 jobs) in the final quarter of last year, the first increase in four years, and I am encouraged by this.  In addition, there has been a modest fall in the Live Register in the opening months of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2218">I am confident that the measures introduced by this Government, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high value added tourism sector, are playing an important role in both creating and sustaining employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2222">I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 92 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">While the EU and the euro area in particular has and continues to experience very turbulent and volatile times, it must be acknowledged that significant policy developments have also taken place.  Considerable progress has been made in terms of improving the functioning of the EU and of the euro area in particular.  Amongst other things we now have:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2224">The EU Semester;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2225">Strengthened surveillance via the so-called "six-pack" of governance measures;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2226">The Euro Plus Pact to <i>inter alia</i>   improve competitiveness; and,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2227">Strengthened financial regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">These are all important developments and demonstrate that the EU can unite and work in the interests of all.  To me this shows that the European Union can make significant decisions and progress that not so long ago would have been seen as almost unthinkable, and I take a lot of encouragement from this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">There is also the comprehensive package announced by the euro area Heads of State or Government on the 26th October 2011.  This, as you know, is essentially a five-point strategy involving:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2230">A credible solution to the Greek situation;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2231">Boosting the effective capacity of the financial support facility;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2232">Recapitalising Europe's banks;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2233">Implementing policies to boost growth and address imbalances; and,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2234">Improving economic governance in the euro area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">I want to assure the Deputy that work is continuing on implementing these important decisions.  It is clear that we have not yet got to the end of the euro area crisis and it is clearly in all of our interests that we move forward as rapidly as possible in that regard.  This evening's informal EU Heads of State or Government meeting and further work in the context of next month's European Council will also be of significance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2236">Turning to the Irish economy, last year the economy expanded by 0.7 per cent, the first year of growth since 2007.  Measures that this Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative last May along with various other policy initiatives have had a positive impact.  The recovery is expected to continue this year, and to both broaden and gain ground in 2013. Over the medium term, a return to robust and more sustainable growth is foreseen. While exports are expected to continue supporting economic activity, a gradual pick-up in domestic demand is also projected as the recovery broadens further and spills over to the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2237">With regard to the impact of a slowdown of growth in Europe as a result of the recent resurgence of the sovereign debt crisis, as a small open economy whose recovery is being driven by exports, we are obviously affected by the slowdown.  It should be noted however, that competitiveness improvements evidenced in recent years will provide some support.</p>
            <p eId="para_2238">Finally, from our perspective, and indeed from the perspective of the euro area as a whole, it is crucial that we move forward as quickly as possible with providing clarity on the future of the euro area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2240">Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving our competitiveness.  Relatively lower price inflation over the last number of years means that Irish price levels have fallen relative to our major trading partners.  At the same time there has been a significant improvement in our cost competitiveness.  Indeed, the European Commission recently forecast that our nominal unit labour costs will have fallen by a cumulative 16.5 percentage points in the period 2009-2013 compared to an increase of 6.6 percentage points for the euro area as a whole.   On foot of these positive developments, we have seen a recovery in our exports as well as an improvement in inward foreign direct investment, and I am encouraged by this.  Having said that, further improvements in competitiveness are clearly needed in order to make significant inroads into the unacceptably high rate of unemployment that we are currently faced with.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2242">Following three successive years in which output fell, positive growth returned to the Irish economy last year. The recovery is expected to continue this year, and to both broaden and gain ground in 2013. Over the medium term, a return to robust and more sustainable growth is foreseen. While exports are expected to continue supporting economic activity, a gradual pick-up in domestic demand is also projected as the recovery broadens further and spills over to the labour market. We have also seen that 2011 marked a record year for inward Foreign Direct Investment and the pipeline remains strong.  All of this points to the fact that many of the underlying strengths of our economy remain, including a well-educated workforce, favourable demographics, an open and flexible economy and a pro-enterprise environment.   Of course there are many challenges which we still face and it will take time to work through the legacies of the crisis. Not least of these is the high level of Government debt which we have accumulated as a result of the substantial fiscal deficits that were recorded in each of the last four years and the very significant costs of providing support to the banking sector. Substantial corrective action has been taken to return stability to the public finances and while General Government Debt is now forecast to peak at 120 per cent of GDP next year, it is expected to decline to around 117 per cent by 2015 based on the recent Stability Programme Update projections. Our public finances are showing signs of improvement after a number of very difficult years and we are on track to bring the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015, in line with the targets set.</p>
            <p eId="para_2243">As the Deputy is aware, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the period 2011-2014.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2244">The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets. The pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.

The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by my Department.</p>

         asked the

         the likely criteria to be applied in the future in respect of stress testing of mortgage applicants with particular reference to the need to have due regard for the established principle of a repayment capacity of approximately two and a half times the income of the borrower; the way it might be expected that this part of the mortgage market might be funded in future in view of the experience of the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2246">Mortgage lending must fully comply with the regulatory requirements set by the Central Bank, both in relation to the financial institution itself and also the safeguarding of the borrower's interests.  When providing a product or service to a customer, a financial institution must comply with the <i>“Knowing the Customer</i>” and “<i>Suitability Provisions</i>” of the Central Bank’s revised Consumer Protection Code (“the Code”), which came into effect on 1 January this year. This process involves, inter alia, gathering relevant information from the customer about his/her financial situation, individual circumstances and needs.  Based on this information, the financial institution is required to complete a “<i>Suitability Process</i>”, where only products suitable to that particular customer are offered. While affordability is a prime component of suitability, a fuller consideration of a customer’s individual circumstances and needs would be required in order to comply with the suitability provisions of the Code.</p>
            <p eId="para_2247">In this regard, a significant addition to the Code is the 2 per cent stress testing that mortgage lenders are obliged to undertake with respect to all personal consumer mortgage applications with the exception of fixed rate mortgage products of at least 5 years duration. The revised Consumer Protection Code may be accessed at <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2248">As regards the future funding of the mortgage market, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the years 2011-2013. SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period.</p>

This framework is supported by extensive digital resources on the Scoilnet website, by professional development programmes for teachers and by investment in ICT infrastructure. All post-primary schools will be connected to a 100Mbps broadband service by the end of 2014, providing for improved integration of ICT in learning.</p>

The reform will also allow for the introduction of optional school developed short courses of 100 hours duration. This will provide a new opportunity for schools to progress the provision of short courses to enhance students' ICT skills which will be embedded in all their learning.

            <p eId="para_2290">The new arrangements  for 2012/13 school year  incorporate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools. This inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools. Shared full-time posts and travel between schools is a long standing feature of the primary system. There were a plethora of long-standing clustering arrangements in place which were not the most practical, efficient or cost effective way to allocate resources. The new arrangements I announced last December are designed to address the limitations of the current arrangements and will operate from September 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2291">Schools are being empowered to cluster and arrange their General Allocation Model resources in a manner that best suits their local needs, including in a manner that reduces travel between schools. This school led process has resulted in over 97% of the overall GAM allocation being in full-time stand-alone or shared posts. Aside from the reforms to the GAM, the allocation of resource hours for individual pupils vary from year to year. This is because of the ongoing individual assessment of pupils through the NCSE must operate on a later timescale. The new arrangements involve the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools and again are designed to make the system work more smoothly at school level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2292">All indications to date are that the new clustering arrangements being made by schools will have the desired effect on the ground. My Department will continue to work with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure that the new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible. As the process proceeds this work can take account of any appropriate local arrangements that might be made to further optimise travel arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2305">Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  My Department has published the staffing arrangements at post primary level for the coming school year, 2012/13.  The relevant Post Primary circular is 0009/2012 which is available on my Department's website.  At post primary level schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students.  Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  All 195 second-level schools in DEIS, including eight of the VEC secondary schools referred to by the Deputy, have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1.  This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools.  In accordance with existing arrangements, where a post primary school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2307">The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedule.  The VEC referred to by the Deputy has submitted an appeal and will be notified of the outcome of the appeal when the appeal process is completed.  The Appeal Board operate independently of the Department and its decision is final.  The final staffing position for all schools at post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2313">My Department actively seeks ways to minimise any disruption to class time.  In 2011, Circulars 8 and 25 set out new arrangements for schools, whereby an additional hour per teacher per week is available in order to provide for a range of essential activities to take place without reducing class contact/tuition time.  School management may designate the use of the additional time to deal with items such as school planning, continuous professional development (CPD), induction and policy development.  In keeping with this development, the professional development support services and education centres also provide much of their training activities through out-of-school hours, modular and online delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2314">While every effort is made to reduce the impact on teaching time, this is not always possible due to the logistics and numbers of teachers involved in, for example, the national roll out of CPD programmes associated with new or revised curricula, or the implementation of national strategies such as the literacy and numeracy strategy.  CPD is offered during school time only when it is considered necessary to do so.  Other than CPD provided by the Department, it is worth noting that many teachers participate in a wide range of CPD and further education on a voluntary and independent basis.</p>

For example, in relation to Fitness to Teach, while this function is not yet commenced, there has been a huge amount of preparatory work done in advance so that the Council will be in a position to undertake this work when the relevant legislative provision is made.

         if, in view of the EU’s proposal for a regulation on statutory audits of public interest companies amending Directive 2006/43/EC, he has considered the likely disincentive effect on Foreign Direct Investment and particularly international financial services, considering that Irish subsidiaries of companies based outside the EU may have to appoint auditors other than those employed for their corporate headquarters or for their other international operations, and the mounting number of international studies warning on the negative impact of key elements of Commissioner Barnier’s proposals on audit costs, independence and on audit quality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2475">I am considering the issue of whether a fee for making a complaint or appeal to the new Workplace Relations bodies, which will be established as part of the reform process, should be introduced.  However, I have made no decision in this regard yet.  I recently published a <i>Blueprint</i> which sets out, in considerable detail, how reform of the workplace relations structures and processes will be achieved.  The document also provided a further opportunity for interested parties to contribute comments and feedback on the future design and operation of the State’s workplace relations structures including whether or not a charge should be introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2476">I indicated in the <i>Blueprint</i> that any fee introduced would be a modest administration fee somewhere in the region of €50.  It would be configured in such a way as to encourage early resolution.  For example one possibility would be that no fee would apply for the Early Resolution Service with the fee only being charged when a case progresses to a hearing.  In addition any fee would likely take into account the considerable additional cost incurred by the state associated with the processing of paper based complaint forms.  Therefore the fee may only apply to paper based complaints with a lesser or no fee applying to complaints submitted and processed online.</p>
            <p eId="para_2477">It is certainly not my intention that any fee introduced would act as a barrier to those employees, of limited means, who have genuine grievances and who wish to vindicate their rights under equality or employment legislation.  I will be examining carefully the suggestions made and advice received on the issue of fees in response to the <i>Blueprint</i> document.</p>

            <p eId="para_2479">IDA Ireland is an autonomous agency whose statutory obligation is the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2480">Through its network of overseas offices IDA Ireland markets the linked hub locations of Killarney in South Kerry and Tralee in North Kerry for new FDI.  Based on the strengths of the region, IDA Ireland is particularly targeting the ICT, International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors.  In addition, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions and FÁS to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_2481">At the end of 2011 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing 1,294 permanent staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2482">One of the targets outlined in IDA's Strategy document "Horizon 2020" is that 50% of investments will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.  It is acknowledged, however, that there is intense and continual international competition to win this FDI, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million.  Ireland has one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so in order to achieve balanced regional development IDA Ireland focuses on promoting Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  In the final analysis, however, it is the investor who decides where to locate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2483">The Government's Action Plan for Jobs has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020.  I recently announced the progress which has been made in this regard so far this year.  Meanwhile, I am already getting suggestions and proposals in relation to preparing the Action Plan for 2013, which I am examining and will bring to Government later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2484">As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the "Succeed in Ireland" initiative, which aims to create 5,000 jobs within five years was launched on 8th   March 2012.  The launch represents the delivery of a key Q1 commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, and also represents a concrete example of the Government's commitment to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.</p>
            <p eId="para_2485">The aim of the Succeed in Ireland initiative is to incentivise people around the world, including our diaspora, to be our eyes and ears on the global stage and help deliver new jobs and investment.  This is an innovative scheme that offers a new channel to reach thousands of small to medium enterprises around the world and spread the word about Ireland's strong reputation as a location for business.'</p>
            <p eId="para_2486">The initiative will complement IDA's existing work in securing FDI from large multinationals, companies at second tier and emerging business companies, and will form a key part of the Government's strategy to deliver investments to regional locations.</p>

The average time taken to award a carer's allowance application is 28 weeks at present, however individual cases may vary. Some will be processed more quickly, others will take longer.  In particular, where a customer requests a review of an initial decision to refuse an application, this will take additional time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">In determining entitlement to the allowance, in certain cases unavoidable time lags are involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.

The pressure placed on the office by this rapid increase in workload has impacted on the length of time taken to process appeals.</p>

This brought the total number of Appeals Officers to 39.  In addition to this the Office has improved its business processes and IT support.</p>

         if any support has been put in place to assist those who have signed up to new rental agreements, who have now been advised of the reductions in the maximum cap on the rent permitted, leading to these persons having to move, and who will now lose the deposits previously awarded through the Health Service Executive community welfare officers leaving them without a deposit for alternative lower-priced rented accommodation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2551">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  There are currently approximately 95,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, with €436m provided in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2552">New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012.  Most claims are reviewed every six months, or when an existing lease expires.  Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.  Departmental officials will support the tenant as s/he seeks alternate accommodation.  An exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be issued for a rent deposit in cases where the applicant has to seek alternate accommodation and is unable to fund a deposit out of their own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment and each application is based on the particular circumstances of the case and at the discretion of the officer administering the SWA scheme.</p>

        <b> Deputy Finian McGrath</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
         the position regarding proposals in relation to the domiciliary care allowance (details supplied). 
        [25769/12]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_704">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2556">As the Deputy is aware, eligibility for domiciliary care allowance (DCA) is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child, rather than to the type of disability involved. Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.  No specific condition or disability rules a child in or out of qualifying for the allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2557">Applications for DCA are assessed on a case by case basis by one of the Department's medical assessors, all of whom are fully qualified medical practitioners who have training/experience in human disability evaluation.  The medical assessor's opinion is based on the information furnished as part of the application process which includes details of the additional care and attention required by the child, as outlined by the parent/guardian and medical details provided by the child's GP.  Any additional information the parent/guardian considers relevant to the application and wishes to include is also reviewed.  This could include, for example, consultant's reports, reports from a community health doctor or a copy of the needs assessment carried out by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2558">It is important to note that the normal ages of attainment data for children up to 4 years are provided to assist the medical assessor in his/her assessment.  It is not a scale which determines eligibility or otherwise.  Reports from child and adolescent psychiatrists, psychologists or occupational therapists usually provide information on the child's individual developmental status on a percentile basis.  Whereas no data provided by the Department on normal age of attainment for children over 4 years of age or adolescents, should a medical assessor consider it helpful, there is a wealth of reference material available in the medical literature.</p>
            <p eId="para_2559">Prior to the transfer of the DCA scheme from the HSE in 2009, an expert medical group examined the scheme and made recommendations on how it should operate within the Department.  These recommendations included the need for a review process and the minimum term that should apply to such reviews.  DCA cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that all the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of a medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child's disability and how their care needs may change over time.  Customers who are reviewed are asked to provide relevant up-to-date medical evidence and details of the additional care needs of their child versus a child of the same age who doesn't have his or her disability.  This information is assessed by a medical assessor and a decision is made based on the medical opinion they provide.  Where payment is stopped as a result of a review, the customer is invited to submit any further information he or she may wish to have considered and that information is further examined and/or he or she may appeal the decision directly to the Social Welfare Appeals office.</p>
            <p eId="para_2560">I recently announced that the Department would shortly be undertaking a policy review of the scheme.  This review will look at, amongst other things, the current application and assessment process and identify any potential improvements to the delivery of service to customers that can be implemented while retaining an efficient and effective operational model.  The issues raised by the Deputy can be considered as part of the review.</p>

It is also normal policy in these cases to review the continuing requirement of the care recipient for full-time care and attention on medical grounds, where that condition has not recently been assessed.

            <p eId="para_2572">The work placement programme (WPP) was announced by Government on 27th May 2009.  By June 2009 it was operationalised and rolled out nationally.

Her claim was refused on the grounds that the care recipient is not so disabled as to require full-time care and attention as prescribed in the carer's benefit legislation.  On 18 May 2012 she was notified of this decision and the reasons for it.  This enquiry is being accepted by carer's benefit section as a request for a review of the decision.

            <p eId="para_2600">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 95,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, with €436m provided in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2601">New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012.  These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2602">For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities. In the case of Meath the following areas were isolated for consideration: Ashbourne; Athboy; Bettystown; Dunshaughlin; Navan; Trim; Ratoath; Kells; Laytown; Enfield; and the rest of Meath county as a whole.  Current information shows there is accommodation available at the new maximum rent limits in county Meath.</p>
            <p eId="para_2603">The focus of the review was primarily based on ensuring an adequate level of housing stock is available, using the 40th percentile as the basis for establishing rent limits.  The full report of the review of maximum rent limits is available on the Department's website at the attached link: <i>http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/ResearchSurveysAndStatistics/Pages/rentreview2011.aspx</i>.</p>

For this reason, eligibility for both participatory and supervisory positions on Tús is confined to those on the Live Register for at least 12 months and in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.

            <p eId="para_2618">On 25 April as a result of issues raised during a topical debate on SAORVIEW coverage in Cork, I requested from RTÉ an overview report on coverage in Cork and I can confirm that a summary report in this regard has since been received from RTÉNL by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2619">This summary concludes that in the Cork area there is a substantial increase in TV coverage as a result of the introduction of SAORVIEW and SAORSAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2620">In relation to SAORVIEW I have been informed by RTÉNL that the SAORVIEW network in Cork covers 96% of the population.  This means that in Cork, 96% of the population can upgrade to SAORVIEW and will receive RTÉ1, RTÉ2, TG4, TV3, 3e, RTÉ1+1, RTÉ News Now, RTÉ jr and 10 RTÉ radio channels.  This is significantly higher than the current analogue TV coverage which is: 90% for RTÉ1 and RTÉ2, 80% for TG4 and 63% for TV3.</p>
            <p eId="para_2621">That said, I can confirm that RTÉNL is continuing to work on developing more detailed information on areas where coverage issues have been identified and my Department will continue to liaise with RTÉNL to ensure that such information is made available at a local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2622">The availability of the RTÉ SAORSAT satellite service increases TV coverage to 100% in all areas.  SAORSAT broadcasts all the SAORVIEW TV channels except the two TV3 channels — TV3 and 3e.  In this regard, it is important to note that TV3 is a commercial broadcaster and, as such, a decision to use SAORSAT will be a commercial decision for TV3.</p>
            <p eId="para_2623">RTÉ is not required to provide SAORSAT but has chosen to develop this unique and innovative solution to ensure a ‘free to air' TV service is available to 100% of the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_2625">Ireland's telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.

            <p eId="para_2640">The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas who wish to avail of such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2641">The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I convened last summer, has had an important role to play in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Taskforce report has now been published.  The report notes that by 2015, over 50% of the population will have access to high speed broadband services with speeds in excess of 70 Mbps.  The report also highlights areas where Government and industry can work together to facilitate the roll out of high speed services across Ireland, and particularly in areas where the case for commercial investment is marginal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">Following on the publication of the Taskforce report, I have also launched a 4 weekconsultation process which can be accessed at the following link; <i>http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Communications/Communications+Policy/Report+of+the+Next+ Generation+Broadband+Taskforce+and+Consultation.htm</i>.  Any submissions or observations can be made electronically to <i>nextgenerationbroadband@dcenr.gov.ie</i> or tweet to @BroadbandPlan12 by close of business on Thursday 31 May 2012.  The purpose of this consultation is to provide further input to this important policy area.  Thereafter, it is my intention to bring proposals to Government for a National Broadband Plan for Ireland.  This plan will build on the recent excellent progress made and be informed by the findings of the Taskforce and subsequent consultation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2646">Fairness and impartiality is a critical component of broadcasting; audiences and citizens deserve to have access to programme material that is objective and free from bias, and particularly so when the broadcaster is publicly funded, as in the case of RTÉ and TG4.</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">Since the introduction of the Broadcasting Act 2009, there is a single regulator in place, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), which is empowered to investigate complaints and to enforce a number of codes, including a Code of Impartiality and Fairness.</p>
            <p eId="para_2648">Recent events have unsurprisingly and correctly led to an unprecedented focus on journalistic practices and standards in RTÉ.  The nature and extent of the failures exposed in RTÉ's investigation of the accusations against Fr Reynolds are such that the Broadcaster has had very serious questions to answer around how it conducts its business, and how the entire organisation delivers on its critical public service broadcasting mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2649">At a meeting with the Board of RTÉ on the 8th of May, I requested that I be provided with a report detailing the range of actions that RTÉ had already taken and, in addition, was proposing to take to ensure that the breaches and failures which occurred in this case will never happen again.  I have also asked that RTÉ reports on a quarterly basis on progress in implementing these reforms and improved practices.  My Department has a key oversight role in this regard.  The first of these reports was received on Tuesday 15th of May, and my Department is following up on the implementation process.  RTÉ faces a long road in terms of regaining public confidence in its output, and much work will be required to rebuild its reputation for high quality investigative journalism, a reputation that was hard won in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2650">The positive response taken by RTÉ to the recommendations of the BAI and Horgan Reports and the measures already instigated are the first but necessary steps for RTÉ in its difficult journey towards rebuilding public trust.</p>
            <p eId="para_2651">Also, I note that the BAI has recently published a new draft Code of Impartiality and Fairness, which sets out a number of improved rules for broadcasters when it comes to the treatment of news and current affairs.  The Consultation has closed for submissions, and I look forward to the publication of a final Code later this year as a further step to reinforce the measures already in place to ensure the objectivity and impartiality of broadcasting.</p>

            <p eId="para_2681">Better Energy Homes is a demand-led programme.  Since commencement in March 2009 the scheme has disbursed over €133m in grants and supported the installation of over 300,000 such measures in over 123,000 homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2682">Exchequer funding of €76.146 million has been allocated to the Better Energy Programme in 2012, which is projected to deliver 433GWh in energy savings.  The Better Energy Programme includes Better Energy Homes, Warmer Homes and Better Energy Workplaces.  Better Energy Homes provides financial assistance to householders who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER.</p>
            <p eId="para_2683">Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the SEAI and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2684">Within the Better Energy Programme €17.148 million has been allocated for Better Energy: Warmer Homes in 2012; and is projected to deliver energy efficiency measures to 17,000 homes.  Energy efficiency upgrades have been delivered to 1,228 homes under the scheme from the start of the year to 30 April amounting to €1.343 million in funding from the Exchequer.  As is normal in the case of the Warmer Homes Scheme, expenditure is expected to intensify in the latter half of the year.  Since commencement of the Programme in 2000, energy efficiency upgrades have been delivered to 81,616 homes amounting to €82.773 million in Exchequer funding.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_2686">The Public Obligation Service (PSO) levy has been in place since 2001 and is the support mechanism for peat generation and the development of renewable electricity.  The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by the three peat stations, from renewable energy sources and from the gas fuelled plant commissioned in 2005 to ensure adequate electricity supply.  Peat-fired electricity plants are supported as they contribute to security of supply through the use of indigenous fuels.  The levy has supported the connection of approximately 2,000 MW of renewable energy, mostly wind, to the electricity grid over the last decade.  The PSO also supports the output of two gas fuelled power plants built in 2005 to secure much needed generation capacity at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2687">The Commission for Energy Regulation determines annually the amount of the PSO levy, which is a charge on all electricity customers.  Its legal basis and method of calculation are set out in the regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_2688">In general terms the cost of the PSO levy to the consumer tends to be low or zero when international gas and oil prices are high, as in these cases the market price adequately rewards renewable and conventional generation including the peat stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2689">In line with the Programme for Government commitment to review and reform the PSO levy, I have requested my Department to review the operation of the peat PSO from a cost efficiency perspective.  This review is currently underway. I would clarify for the Deputy that funding for Exchequer programmes, such as Better Energy or Warmer Homes schemes, would not arise as a result of savings accrued from changes in the PSO.  The PSO levy is a charge to all electricity customers.  The levy covers <i>inter alia </i>the additional costs incurred by electricity suppliers, such as Electricity Ireland, Airtricity and Bord Gáis Energy, in sourcing, and ESB Power Generation in producing, a proportion of their electricity from peat or renewable generators.  Any reduction in the PSO year on year results in a reduction in the charge levied on all electricity customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2691">The feed in tariff or REFIT scheme underpins investment in renewable energy to meet Ireland's legally binding renewable target, by providing sufficient certainty to developers to finance projects through the guarantee of a minimum price for wind exported to the grid over a 15 year period.  Such schemes are common across EU Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_2692">The original REFIT scheme for which state aid approval was obtained in 2007 has supported a significant expansion in wind energy in a relatively short period.  In March 2012, my Department launched the next phase of the REFIT scheme for onshore wind, known as REFIT 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_2693">While similar in many respects to the first scheme, some dimensions of the scheme have been re-designed to ensure support costs continue to be cost efficient.  Under REFIT 2, when the electricity market payment exceeds the combination of the REFIT reference price plus balancing payment, no payment from the Public Service Obligation levy is made under the scheme.  Currently the average market payment in the Single Electricity Market is broadly similar to or slightly higher than the REFIT reference price.</p>
            <p eId="para_2694">The structure of REFIT 2 means that if the market payment rises above the REFIT reference price plus balancing payment due, for example, to high fossil fuel prices, there is no support cost for wind on the system under the scheme.  Conversely, at times when a large amount of wind is available on the system, the wholesale electricity market price is reduced meaning that consumers pay less for all electricity.  The ESRI and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) have demonstrated that wind provides a useful hedge against high fossil fuel prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2695">To be eligible for the REFIT 2 scheme, projects must be built by 31/12/15.  No decision has been taken as to what, if any, support scheme will apply to onshore wind projects after that date.  The costs of developing onshore wind will be kept under review as the technology continues to mature over the next number of years.   In compliance with the third International Energy Market Directive, the structure of the all island electricity market will require change.  Decisions on how renewable energy development will be encouraged in future will be taken in the context of developing the new electricity market structure.</p>

            <p eId="para_2697">There are no feed in tariff schemes in place for offshore wind, wave or tidal energy technologies.  The Government decided earlier this year to encourage the development of offshore wind as an export opportunity rather than as a contributor to the domestic electricity market and therefore a feed in tariff support mechanism is not being introduced for offshore wind.  Wave and tidal technology is still at the RD&amp;D stage globally and is not yet a commercially viable technology.  There is no electricity from wave or tidal sources being exported to the Irish electricity grid, hence a feed in tariff would not be payable at this stage in any event and any such support scheme would be subject to Government and State-Aid approval.  I have no plans to bring forward such a proposal.  The Ocean Energy Development Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the R&amp;D support programme for wave and tidal technologies.  To date, 33 wave and tidal projects have received funding from SEAI under the Prototype Development Fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_2699">As the Deputy will be aware, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) has the statutory responsibility for investigating complaints against all broadcasters based in this State.  The BAI reports that a total of eleven complaints against RTÉ were upheld on grounds of impartiality and fairness in the years from 2006 to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2700">The RTÉ Primetime Investigates documentary titled "Mission to Prey" was broadcast on the 23rd of May 2011.  The subsequent defamation proceedings and the outcome of the BAI report conducted under Section 53 of the 2009 Act have unsurprisingly and correctly led to an unprecedented focus on journalistic practices and standards in RTÉ.  The nature and extent of the failures exposed in RTÉ's investigation of the accusations against Fr Reynolds are such that the Broadcaster has had very serious questions to answer around how it conducts its business, and how the entire organisation delivers on its critical public service broadcasting mandate.  In the past, I understand that the outcome of successful complaints were dealt with at an operation level within the broadcaster.  However, a central component of the reporting arrangement put in place to ensure thorough implementation of the recommendations of the BAI and Horgan Reports is a review of Journalism Guidelines, an increased emphasis on training and the establishment of a new Editorial Standards Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_2701">Also, I note that the BAI has recently published a new draft Code of Impartiality and Fairness, which sets out a number of improved rules for broadcasters when it comes to the treatment of news and current affairs.  The Consultation has closed for submissions, and I look forward to the publication of a final Code later this year as a further step to reinforce the measures already in place to ensure the objectivity and impartiality of broadcasting.</p>

            <p eId="para_2709">Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis. The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2710">The Commissioner, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been reviewing various options for streamlining the valuation process and speeding up the national revaluation programme. In this regard, the Government recently approved the drafting of a Valuation Bill to amend the Valuation Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2711">I have asked local authorities to exercise restraint in setting their Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in the context of the adoption of their 2012 budgets.  From the adopted Budgets for 2012 submitted to my Department by the 88 rating local authorities, 68 authorities have maintained their ARVs at 2011 levels and 19 local authorities have reduced their ARVs.  One local authority has increased its ARV and will continue to increase it until 2015, but this is a technical adjustment and legal requirement following the extension of a town boundary. Overall, the average change of ARV from 2011 to 2012 shows a decrease of 0.31%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2712">I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under consideration in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2749">Ireland signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1968 and ratified it in December, 2000 whereupon it became binding on Ireland in international law.  At the time of ratification of the Convention, a reservation/interpretative declaration was entered in relation to Article 4 of the Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2750">The declaration (i) notes that the measures described in Article 4(a), (b) and (c) shall be undertaken with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights set forth in Article 5 of the Convention and (ii) states that Ireland considers that through the measures described in Article 4, the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to peaceful assembly and association may not be jeopardised.</p>
            <p eId="para_2751">According to the United Nations Treaty Collection website, <i>http://treaties.un.org</i>, a number of other States Parties have made similar declarations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">I have no immediate plans to propose withdrawing Ireland's reservation/interpretative declaration on Article 4 of the Convention.</p>

            <p eId="para_2756">Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p>

I am further informed that dedicated high visibility policing patrols, both foot and mobile, were introduced in the north inner city in order to combat anti-social behaviour in the area.  The primary focus of these policing initiatives is to pay particular attention to persons and individuals involved in anti-social behaviour and criminal activities.  The operation is focused on core times in order to correlate with the volume of patrons using the main thoroughfare.</p>
            <p eId="para_2873">I am also informed that all licensed premises in the city centre are closely monitored, with particular regard to the sale and supply of alcohol to minors, and allowing drunkenness on licensed premises.  Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences. Community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  Local Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the area in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_2875">The Bill dealing with the reform of the legal sector and of legal costs, to which I assume the Deputy is referring, is the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. Part 9 of the Bill, which comprises five chapters, makes extensive provision in relation to the charging and adjudication of legal costs supported by the Principles Relating to Legal Costs which are set out, for the first time in statute, under Schedule 1 of the Bill. In addition to making legal costs and the basis upon which they are charged more transparent to consumers of legal services, the Bill provides that determinations made about legal costs by the new Legal Costs Adjudicator will be made public. Under the Bill, the Adjudicator is to assume the role of the existing Taxing-Master and will also be empowered to issue legal costs guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2876">The Legal Services Regulation Bill completed Second Stage in the Dáil on 23rd February, 2012. In closing the Second Stage debate I have outlined the approaches being taken to enhancing the Bill in preparation for Committee Stage. Work on the details of the proposed amendments to the Bill is ongoing at my Department including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and the amendments will, as I have previously explained, be made available in advance of Committee Stage. It remains my objective, notwithstanding the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, that Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill commence before the summer recess.  In relation to the Family Law Bill, proposals are being advanced in my Department as quickly as possible, subject to the disposal of other priorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2979">I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 192 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2980">The farm gate value of the poultry sector, at €150m (approx €120m meat and €30m eggs), accounts for approximately 3% of gross agricultural output. Within this, the turkey production sector is a small niche element which is highly seasonal and which has a high level of vertical integration. <i>Food Harvest 2020</i> targets a 10% increase in the value of output of the poultry sector by 2020. It has identified scope for some reduction in transport costs together with efficiencies through cost effective energy use in terms of increased scale and volume of modern housing facilities. In addition, improved feed conversion rates and an improvement in the quality of birds produced can help achieve these targets and maintain producer viability.</p>
            <p eId="para_2981">Investment in innovation and value-added output together with ongoing promotion under Quality Assurance Schemes will also help in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2982">The Common Agricultural Policy constrains the financial assistance that can be afforded to poultry producers with such assistance usually linked to avian health or welfare considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2983">My Department is responsible for the registration of turkey production sites and hatcheries and registered sites are required to comply with regulations pertaining to animal welfare, hygiene, disease control and marketing and production standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2984">Capacity utilisation decisions are made having regard to commercial considerations and are a matter for operators.</p>

            <p eId="para_2986">Adoptions from Ethiopia, effected under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined, and recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI). These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2012. The Adoption Act 2010 also contains provision for a one year extension to declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which may lead to a one year extension to this date. Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. In these circumstances, adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "<i>the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.”  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2987">A delegation from the Adoption Authority visited Ethiopia in April and held exploratory meetings with the Ethiopian authorities regarding the system of adoption which operates in that country. The delegation, in the course of its visit, held preliminary discussions with the Ethiopian authorities around the potential for a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption. The Authority submitted its initial report which summarises the conclusions and recommendations of the delegation's visit on the 21st of May. While this is now being considered in my Department, the AAI has stated that it is seeking further legal advice in Ethiopia on whether adoptions there are full or simple adoptions. The Authority indicated that it will contact me again once it has received this legal advice and has completed its consideration of the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2991">The Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960 provides for the fluoridation of public piped water supplies. This is achieved through the addition of hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFSA) to the water.  The complete and rapid reaction between HFSA and water produces hydrogen ions (which are removed through a process called buffering), silica (sand) and fluoride ions. Consumers do not come into contact with HFSA as water from the tap contains fluoride, not HFSA or fluorosilicates.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups. ere are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_3004">I want to offer my deepest sympathies to the family concerned.  We must never forget that this report is first and foremost about patient safety and that it all began because of the death of a patient on a trolley in a corridor adjacent to the Emergency Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3005">I believe however that patients in all of our acute hospitals need the assurance that this matter is being dealt with in an effective way, that lessons have been learned and that Quality Assurance Systems are being put in place across the country  This report as an important element in driving the Health Reform Programme which is focusing on and prioritising patient safety and best governance. The HIQA report gives us a template for hospital governance as we move to the establishment of the new Hospital Groups to be established this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3006">Many changes have already happened in Tallaght Hospital and the report acknowledges this.  The practice of leaving patients waiting on trolleys for admission in a corridor adjacent to the Emergency Department was clinically unsafe and completely unacceptable. This has been stopped.</p>
            <p eId="para_3007">The report found that there was no clarity as to who was providing medical supervision of these patients. This is completely unacceptable. For that reason the Chief Medical Officer has referred the report to the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais to ask them to address the significant issues that arise.  The CEO of HIQA wrote to me last November because of her concerns about the deficits in governance and management at the hospital. As a result a new interim Board, chaired by Sir Keith Pearson was appointed last December. A new CEO is in place who is building a new management team including clinical leadership.</p>
            <p eId="para_3008">Safe quality health care is a fundamental principle of the reform programme. I have approved the HIQA National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare to underpin the development of quality safe healthcare services. The National Standards also describe what capacity and capability factors service providers require to implement these Standards.  Service providers, including the private (independent) service providers, can use the National Standards as a framework to organise, manage and deliver their services safely.  It is also important to recognise that the staff of the hospital have a hugely important role in responding to the challenges ahead and in restoring and supporting this Hospital to achieve its potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_3020">The development of primary care is central to this Government's objective to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health care system. The Programme for Government states that primary care will be an immediate priority area. The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary care and represents a tangible re-focussing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.    The delivery of the necessary infrastructure must be informed by needs analysis, with priority given to areas of urban and rural deprivation.  The HSE is currently engaged in prioritising primary care centre locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3021">A draft capital plan for the period 2012-2016 has been submitted to my Department.   My Department is reviewing the proposals and following up with the HSE where further details may be required.  The proposed plan requires my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Details of the plan will be published by the Executive following its approval.</p>

            <p eId="para_3056">As the Deputy may be aware, Health Service Executive policy on elder abuse is derived from the 2002 report of the Working Group on Elder Abuse, <i>Protecting Our Future</i> and the 2009 Review of that Report.  <i>Protecting Our Future</i> defines elder abuse as “<i>A single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person or violates their human and civil rights.”</i>Elder Abuse is a complex issue and can occur in many forms, including: physical, sexual, psychological, financial, and discriminatory abuse, or neglect.  Consequently tackling and preventing elder abuse requires a multifaceted response which may involve working with older people, families, communities, statutory agencies and businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_3057">Protections for older people in residential care are strengthened by the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland</i> and underpinned by the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3058">A number of legal remedies are available to address the issue both in terms of protecting those older people who may be at risk of abusive behaviours, and in terms of prosecuting those responsible for abuse, mistreatment or neglect.  Supports and assistance are also available from the Health Service and other Agencies in the case of family breakdown where it would not be appropriate to have legislative interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3059">The Department of Health has no plans to further develop statutory protections for this area at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_3062">A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment with a focus on relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients, regardless of their medical condition.  This includes 2 fillings, all extractions and a number of complex treatments.  The National Oral Health Office of the HSE issued Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to dental contractors in November 2011 to support equitable and priority funding and provide clearer guidance to dentists on the application of DTSS prior approval requests.

They receive all DTSS services that were available prior to April 2010 which includes all fillings as required and approval for complex care including root canal treatment, gum treatment and dentures.  Examples of recent increases in the number of treatments (year to date) which indicate that people are not neglecting their dental health and are gaining access to services are as follows:</p>
