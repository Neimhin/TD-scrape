          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I welcome the Taoiseach back to the House. It must be difficult for him to adjust from the lofty heights of international politics on the world stage as President of the European Union. It is not a case of, "Come back, all is forgiven." The House will have an opportunity to pay him credit for his work in Europe later this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">While the Taoiseach was away, a series of elections was held here. In the course of those elections, his name, his title and his photograph were used without his permission in the sunny south-east, in respect of representatives who would be fair and honest. People were asked in the Taoiseach's name to vote in a particular way. This ethical scandal comes in a long list. I remind him of the history of his involvement in the signing of blank cheques, which he admitted some years ago. There were reports of Fianna Fáil election literature stapled to voting cards. There was the misuse of the diplomatic bag in the case of a letter, which was actually signed by the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">The letter which is at present in question makes for interesting reading. It calls for support for a candidate whom it describes as "patriotic and honest". I understand this letter was sent to over 2,000 constituents. Will the Taoiseach say if he has seen this letter? Did it carry his consent and <i>imprimatur</i>? Does he regard it as a forgery and if so, what action does he propose to take as a consequence?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_6">I hope I am not hearing correctly that since I went away poor Deputy Kenny is suffering from loss of memory. The election was discussed in the House a fortnight ago. My last visit to this House was following the election and it was discussed on two consecutive days.</p>

          <p eId="para_9">I am pleased to inform Deputy Kenny that this side of the House has in recent years put in place legislation covering standards in public office which is very good legislation in my view.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_10">It was done by us.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_11">It allows for investigation of all matters that are deemed inappropriate. The Government has laid down guidelines and standards that have been endorsed by the Standards in Public Office Commission regarding use and misuse. Issues about the use of Oireachtas envelopes were raised during the election. Questions were asked about who used Oireachtas envelopes and their use by Members of the Oireachtas from different parties. That matter has been brought to my attention. I could list a fair litany of instances for the Deputy. It may be best to leave it to what has been stated by the Standards in Public Office Commission, that there should not be a misuse of public funds given to either political parties or to office holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">In answer to Deputy Kenny's question on the issue of Lorcan Allen, I did not have any prior knowledge that my signature was to be used on a letter to voters in Gorey.

          <p eId="para_16">The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, sitting beside the Taoiseach, was man enough to apologise to the House after the Standards in Public Office Commission reprimanded him. We are still waiting for the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to appear and that speaks for itself in terms of the legislation introduced by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The Taoiseach should not talk about the general secretary or the national executive of Fianna Fáil. The letter has a picture of the Taoiseach on it and it states, "A lot done, more to do." The Taoiseach's signature appears on it. The Taoiseach is still President of the European Union and this letter was sent out in his name.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I recommend the Taoiseach read the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 which states in section 25:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_19">A person is guilty of forgery if he or she makes a false instrument with the intention that it shall be used to induce another person to accept it as genuine and, by reason of so accepting it, to do some act, or to make some omission, to the prejudice of that person or any other person.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">If the Taoiseach does not take action, he is likely to have a situation arise where his name and title could be used in anything from an application from a student for a summer job in McDonald's to somebody wishing to enter the United States with a reference from Bertie Ahern. It is not good enough in his capacity as Taoiseach and leader of the Government of our country and as one who has served very well as President of the European Union. In the context of this legislation, it behoves him to do more than refer the matter to the general secretary and national executive of the Fianna Fáil Party. What does the Taoiseach propose to do about it?</p>

Now that he is back, the entire country is waiting to hear when he will reshuffle the most under-performing, indigent Cabinet in the history of the State. In case the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has any doubt about what went on while he was away, most of his backbench Deputies and, surprisingly, the Minister for Finance agree with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">The Minister for Foreign Affairs must have heard the Minister for Finance state this morning that the normal tendency in this Cabinet is for Ministers to blame anyone but themselves for their lamentable performance. He stated he is tired of lecturing colleagues "who are crying and whinging about not doing things". The current Cabinet, he said, would not be in Government forever and for God's sake should get on and do it. Despite this, he cannot get a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">It is little wonder that a forlorn photograph of the Minister for Transport appears on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent </i>this morning. Our visitors from the United States Congress would consider it a scandal if in that great country, with its budget, a roads programme costed at €7 billion ended up costing €16.5 billion. It is the same with everything the Government touches. The Minister for Health and Children cannot tackle queues for public hospitals or deal with accident and emergency or any other matter. He cannot deal with anything except producing another report.</p>

Perhaps his answer to a question will be an issue of the day. I welcome the commencement at long last of the Luas service, particularly as the Green Party was the first party to call for a light rail service in the 1980s. The Fianna Fáil Party promised light rail for Dublin in 1991 but we have had decades of dithering before what Dubliners are calling the ‘Daniel Day Lewis' is operating. At least, however, we have something to show after so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">In the face of the scathing and scandalous reports about lack of planning and cost analysis in transport, particularly in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, has the Government learned anything in recent years and will it change its ways in the future? Will a comprehensive Luas system be provided whereby the two lines will be connected between Abbey Street and St. Stephen’s Green?</p>
          <p eId="para_64">More pertinently, when will the Government make a decision on the metro, given that it has been promised so often? When I asked about the metro on 30 September 2003, the Taoiseach replied: "The matter will come before Government in the next few weeks when we will make a decision." The Minister for Transport stated in May 2003, "I will bring my proposals to Government in the coming weeks"; in June 2003 he said "Next month"; in July 2003 he said "Shortly"; in October 2003 he said, "In the coming weeks we will have the metro decision"; in November 2003 he stated, "It will be coming to the Government shortly"; in December 2003 he said "In the coming weeks"; in January 2004 he said "coming weeks" and he made the same statement in March. Promises have been made repeatedly. How many weeks will it take for a decision to be taken on the metro? For a change, will the Taoiseach give us a date because "coming weeks" is like <i>Waiting for Godot</i>?</p>

Hopefully, finalisation of the original report will happen in time, whether it is in the form of the metro or otherwise. As the Deputy is aware, we have examined a number of proposals. The Rail Procurement Agency has brought forward many proposals over the past few years regarding a metro or completion of the Luas or a light rail system. The difficulty is the cost of these projects has been astronomical and the cost is way out of line with what is considered reasonable for the taxpayer to bear.</p>

However, planning laws, constitutional law and the rights of people vary and one cannot match like with like.

The level of brass neck was astounding because reports in today's newspapers indicate a total disregard for the cost of such projects. A sum of €9.4 billion in taxpayers' money has been wasted on capital projects and that must be addressed. Luas cost €750 million but €9.4 billion has been wasted. A number of Luas lines and a good metro could be built for that amount. It is amazing the Taoiseach is not prepared to address that issue and reach a decision on the metro while he is at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">The Taoiseach referred to a cost problem, yet no cost benefit analysis has been conducted on the roads programme, the NRA's road needs study was rejected by him and he has decided to build 800 km of motorway. I am amazed I have not received a reply to the question I asked. A cost benefit analysis of the roads programme has not been conducted, yet four times more is being spent on roads than on public transport in the capital programme. When will the metro decision be taken? The people need to know. The Taoiseach told me in September 2003 that a decision would be taken in a few weeks. Can we at least get a date?</p>

          <p eId="para_85">Money is not wasted. When a project is proposed, an indicative sum is listed before site acquisition, a decision on a route, planning or a tender price — I refer to the tender price of most contracts in recent years. The Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges that fixed price contracts are coming in more or less on time. For example, there have been difficulties with the enormous port tunnel project but the total price will be under €700 million, which compares favourably with the tender price. There is not much change even on large scale projects, particularly if one considers the design issues that arose on the port tunnel project.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">Prime Minister Blair and I, together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, met the Northern Ireland parties in London last Friday. I had met Prime Minister Blair in May and early June, when we also discussed Northern Ireland and EU matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">We need to step up our efforts if discussions are to be brought to a successful conclusion. The two Governments last Friday, therefore, announced they will lead intensive political dialogue with the parties at the beginning of September to finalise an agreement on all outstanding issues with a view to restoring the full and inclusive operation of the political institutions as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">The issues are clear. We must reach agreement on a definitive and conclusive end to all paramilitary activity; the decommissioning, through the IICD, of all paramilitary weapons, to an early timescale and on a convincing basis; a clear commitment on all sides to the stability of the political institutions and to any changes to their operation agreed within the review; and support for policing from all sides of the community and on an agreed framework for the devolution of policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">We cannot allow matters to drift. We are determined that agreement should be reached on these key issues at the latest by the autumn. The review will resume in September to complete its work. At our meeting last Friday, we urged the parties to maintain their engagement over the summer with a view to advancing progress on these issues and to prepare their respective constituencies for the substantial steps that will be required to reach overall agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">We believe the parties understand and accept the responsibility that their electoral mandates have placed on them to resolve the current impasse. This responsibility requires all parties to demonstrate a commitment to reach the fundamental accommodation we all wish to see. It is critical that Northern Ireland enjoys a summer free from violence and tension on the streets. We hope all parties will work to ensure events over the coming months create the right atmosphere for successful talks in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">The question of a meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is a matter for the chairman and participating parties. However, I expect that the focus of the parties will be on the talks scheduled for September.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">Is the Taoiseach aware of a recent survey in Northern Ireland which showed that 12% of adults questioned believed that direct rule for Northern Ireland worked well, 60% did not mind one way or the other whether the Assembly was ever reconvened and only 37% said they would be sorry if it were abolished? Is this alarming level of apathy about the future of the Assembly a cause of concern for the Taoiseach? Does he agree that every effort should be made to counteract this sense of disillusionment? In that context, how does he, along with the British Prime Minster, propose to bring this back to the top of the Irish Government's political agenda? Did the Taoiseach mention this matter to President Bush at their recent meeting? Was it discussed at all?</p>
            <p eId="para_112">Is the Taoiseach concerned by the remarks made by the Prime Minister that the two Governments could be forced to look beyond the Good Friday Agreement for a political way forward in the absence of any agreement between the DUP and Sinn Féin? Does he agree that it would be inappropriate if the Good Friday Agreement were parked in any way or if we discussed any possible alternatives to it?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_76">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_113">To take Deputy Kenny's first question, that is precisely what I was saying in the House earlier in the year. Having had the Assembly elections in November, if we did not reach conclusions, the public was going to become cynical about electing people to an Assembly which was not functioning. That is exactly what is happening. People were very supportive of the Assembly and the executive when they were up and running but when they are not and people in office still receive allowances, the public becomes cynical. The public sees that action is not being taken and direct rule is in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">Clearly if we continue to have peace, which we want, then people can become <i>laissez faire</i> about this, and I appreciate that although, if it were the other way around, people would change their minds very quickly. This is always a dangerous vacuum and we have been working for the past five to six weeks to ensure the summer is peaceful. There has been much hard work to achieve a peaceful summer among all the parties, including loyalist groups. The change in the Parades Commission decision on the Whiterock parade last week was something that offended Nationalists but we are glad the parade was peaceful.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">Deputy Kenny asked about the issues. They have not changed for the last few years. The difficulty lies in getting people to face up to making decisions on paramilitarism, decommissioning, policing and stable political institutions. Those crunch issues have all been identified by the parties and must be resolved. We must reach agreement on them, and that has not changed since October 2002 when we made the acts of completion speech. We have been working since then on this and we made two efforts last year, in March and October, to bring the matter to finality. While some progress was made on the Joint Declaration, we did not reach the point we wanted. The review, in which much good work has been done, has been going on for some months and we hope that this will come to a conclusion in the autumn. However, if we are to make progress that makes a difference, then the issues I referred to must be addressed, and that is where we have centred our efforts for the past month or two. The parties will stay in touch with the Government over the summer period, but at the beginning of September, we must see if we can resolve these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">Deputy Kenny asked about the British Prime Minister's comments. He is not abandoning the Good Friday Agreement but the public, not to mention the Governments and parties, is asking where we go next if we cannot find resolution on these issues. What is the alternative? Do we go back to direct rule, as it is? That is not something I support. Do the two Governments become more involved? That is inevitable if we are unable to proceed with the Good Friday Agreement exactly as negotiated. My preference is for the Agreement, the institutions, the Assembly, the executive and the North-South bodies to be all working effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">There is not much point in going on and on. Nothing new has been said by anyone in recent meetings and we are really going around the houses to a boring degree. We all know the issues but unfortunately there is not much I can contribute to the ending of paramilitarism. There is nothing I can do about decommissioning. I can do a lot to create stable political institutions and we have done our work on policing. Naturally we would like to see everyone play a part in that.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">We have identified other issues such as equality on which the Irish and British Governments must work but everyone knows the position. It is a question of whether we can finish these issues. As I have said to Deputy Kenny before, if we do not finish these, we cannot proceed with the other ones. That is the difficulty. There is no hope of us achieving stability in the institutions if we do not deal with the other issues first. That is crystal clear to everyone and there is no point in my saying any more because everyone knows it and there are no alternative views. The question is whether we can do this and we will have to see in September.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_77">
            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_119">Some time ago I asked the President of Sinn Féin if he thought the IRA would go out of existence. He said that if the Good Friday Agreement were implemented in full then the IRA would fade away. I asked if he would contribute to making it fade away but I am not too clear on his response.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">Obviously we would aspire to having paramilitarism in all its forms abolished. The International Monitoring Commission report indicates clearly that there is substantial activity in this area, bordering on racketeering, crime, paramilitarism and other matters of grave concern. I am glad the Taoiseach will reconvene discussions with the British Prime Minister in September. I hope the fact that Sinn Féin has made gains in the democratic process and formed working arrangements with Fianna Fáil in several counties after the recent local elections will make its members see that having travelled some way on the road to democracy, the links between the party and paramilitarism should be cut forever. Other parties in Northern Ireland with fringe links to paramilitarism, although to a lesser extent in some cases, should also see the value of that. If we are talking about the new Ireland of the next 20 years, then this is critical to the Taoiseach's work and I will support him in those discussions with the Prime Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">When the Taoiseach begins his discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in September, will those discussions start at the point where agreement ended in the previous discussions? We were almost at a point of conclusion on this last year but Mr. Trimble decided not to go through with it. In that context, will the Government still put forward the proposition that in a final conclusion to this, the McCabe killers, for instance, will still be eligible for early release? In other words, when the Taoiseach starts his discussions with him, is he starting from where he last concluded? In that particular instance, can he say, "No, these people must serve their full time"?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_78">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_122">I appreciate Deputy Kenny's support for the overall framework. We will continue to move on. In regard to violence and paramilitarism in all its forms, loyalists have been responsible for much of the paramilitary activity in recent months and we cannot forget that. There has been a significant amount of loyalist activity of one form or another. We want to try to end it. In terms of getting the Executive and the institutions up and running, IRA paramilitarism is the issue we must crack.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">On the negotiations, since the beginning of the year the work of the review has been useful so it is not really a question of from where we are starting or where we ended last year. I think we have moved the situation on. Even last week we discussed much good work that has taken place across the three strands. People have put forward proposals and there have been very good papers and good suggestions from all the parties. Obviously, we must get consensus before they are implemented but useful work has been done.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">In regard to where the Government stands and the issues it has, our position on this has been clear throughout. What we must achieve is a complete end to IRA paramilitarism and decommissioning. It is in that context the possible release of the killers of Jerry McCabe would arise. That is what I said last year. It could only happen specifically in the context of acts of completion. That is understood. Acts of completion means arms decommissioning as well as an end to all forms of paramilitarism by the IRA. That would mean the IRA moving definitively away from violence. What is required is a complete transition to peaceful, democratic means in Northern Ireland. It is only then that we can consider these and other issues. There are the OTRs which will affect the South as well, although it may not affect many people. There is also the issue of participation in debates on the North in the Oireachtas. These are issues I support but which can only be done in the context of reaching a finality.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">We will continue to work during the summer. Parties will be away at different times which will not help that work, but we will keep in touch with spokespeople who are here and will continue to make as much progress as possible. At the beginning of September, we will see if we can make progress on these issues.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_79">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_126">What is the Taoiseach's realistic assessment of the prospects of success in the autumn in the context of statements from some of the parties? For example, the DUP seemed quite optimistic about the prospect of successful discussions in autumn, while Sinn Féin described the latest talks as a waste of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">I wish to go back to Prime Minister Blair's comment that if the talks in autumn were not successful, an alternative would have to be found. Can the Taoiseach be any more explicit with the House? Is there a plan B or was that just a statement to inject urgency into the proceedings? I accept the absolute necessity for urgency to be injected into the talks but does the Taoiseach not accept that the hothouse approach of intensive discussions surrounded by much hype over a couple of days has failed in the past? If it was to fail again against the backdrop of the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach apparently assenting that some plan B would have to be resorted to, that would be a fairly serious matter if we had to depart from the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_80">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_128">I agree with a number of points Deputy Rabbitte made and I will try to answer the questions he asked. We do not disagree on the issue of urgency. He asked me for my best assessment. One must always remain optimistic and hopeful about the process. If he asked me whether I was confident, I would fall a good bit short of that. To give my best assessment, I think the parties are up for doing what is necessary. The difficulty is that they are not talking to each other. It is a bit like being back where we were a number of years ago in 1998 when we were trying to deal with parties from the middle ground. Obviously, the two Governments have been correctly able to give each other an assessment of each other's papers. The choreography, in so far as one can do that, is good.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">If one stands back and looks at the situation with the two main parties not talking to or meeting each other, it is a significant move to bring that forward to a situation in which the two parties are in the Executive running Northern Ireland together. I find that a stretch and it is difficult for me to see that happening in a short time. However, it is possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">It is a case of whether all sides are generous enough about dealing with the issues which have, quite frankly, been analysed and talked to death and which are obviously resulting in boredom among the people of Northern Ireland. Deputy Kenny referred to opinion polls on the views of people on Northern Ireland. If we could look at the issues and if people were to take these steps, they would be prepared to work together and to get on with it. I have continually said to them that if we go past the first anniversary of the election, do not move to that position and, as is inevitable in Northern Ireland, feed into the January period which looks as if it could be a run in to a general election in Britain, although I do not know the date — there are local elections anyway — I know the difficulties that will cause because I have been at that stage so many times before. I hope we have a good chance, although it is hard to say it is a great one. However, we have to make a great effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">I refer to Prime Minister Blair's comments and to some of my own. Perhaps I was a bit more cautious in what I said, but one has to wonder what would constitute a plan B if we cannot find a way forward. Much as I hate to ask, if we cannot get this to work, is it satisfactory to leave the situation in limbo and to hope that one can make progress? I have to be honest and say that over recent months, I have started to ask if there is another way or means by which we can do this. I will be frank in reply to Deputy Rabbitte, which I think he will appreciate. If both sides, particularly those in the driving seat, so to speak, continue to take the view that we have not quite got there or reached a finality even though we are making progress, is that good enough for everybody else?</p>
            <p eId="para_132">The Deputy will appreciate there are other parties. A parallel in this House, which I do not think is an unreasonable one, would be if Deputy Rabbitte and I were having a barney outside, were not meeting each other and all the other political parties were not in the frame. Increasingly, I must listen to what the other parties are saying because they have a point. We must think beyond where we are. I am not saying it is a game or a tactic. However, if it becomes an inevitability that the game goes back and forth like ping-pong, everyone else is outside watching it and if we never get a result, that will create many problems. That is reflected to me more and more.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">It is very much plan B so we have to press ahead with this to see if the words turn to deeds. That is why I hate the hothouse and was very resistant to it for a number of months. Everything the Deputy said about that is correct — one builds an expectation, which builds international publicity. More than others, people in Northern Ireland expect something, but very little occurs so we are further back than before. Unless much of it can be pre-cooked, I do not like the concept of the hothouse and I do not think we are at that stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply, which bears re-reading and is very interesting for a number of reasons. As regards his passing reference to those in the driving seat, will he assure the House in respect of that point? Prior to the Assembly elections there was a feeling, which I shared, that the focus of inclusion was on the Official Unionist Party and Sinn Féin. That was to the exclusion — perhaps I should not use the word "exclusion" because the DUP excluded itself — or diminished involvement or participation by the SDLP. On this occasion the focus of inclusiveness seems to be on the DUP and Sinn Féin, while the Official Unionists and the SDLP are very much playing supporting roles. Will the Taoiseach assure the House that for the process to reach a successful conclusion the involvement and parity of esteem, if I may adapt that term, is important in terms of including all the parties concerned with the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_135">The answer to that question is "Yes". The reality is as Deputy Rabbitte has set it out. It is not always possible to have people 100% in, but the House has my assurance that everyone will be involved in so far as one can keep people fully involved. As the Deputy knows, in the review we tried to engage everyone as completely as possible. The UUP had difficulties with participating fully in that, but the Government has emphasised to the British Government all the time that we should try to keep everybody in or close to the process. Whatever happens ultimately, it will take all political parties to sell it to their respective constituencies and groups. They may change in size from time to time but it is still important for everyone to be involved. That was the whole basis of the Good Friday Agreement — it was an inclusive agreement appreciating everybody's parity of esteem and accepting that everybody had a contribution to make. We will certainly endeavour to involve people on a cross-community basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">Following my earlier question about the Taoiseach's meetings with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, I wish to ask about plans that may exist either here or in Britain for referenda to ratify the European constitution. Has the Taoiseach discussed this matter with Mr. Blair? If not, would it not be appropriate to discuss the merits of having both referenda on the same day, given that institutions and organisations throughout the island of Ireland would then have an opportunity for a considered debate that would also reflect on the implications for political institutions and democracy North and South? In the context of trying to build a momentum for the restoration of the institutions, as well as facilitating the Good Friday Agreement in the three strands that exist, would there not be merit in holding the referenda on the same day?</p>
            <p eId="para_137">A recent poll carried out by researchers in Queen's University and the University of Ulster suggested a growing disenchantment with the Northern Ireland Assembly and a rising acceptance of direct rule from London, especially among Unionists. Does that indicate the need not to reward a strategy of prevarication, which seems to have been well ingrained in the DUP and certain sections of the Ulster Unionist Party? What will the Taoiseach do to address that acceptance of a strategy of prevarication, which seems to be deliberate? Is there any counter measure to that strategy, which could advance the momentum so that the prevarication does not take further root?</p>

            <p eId="para_143">That is not what they are saying, although I know there are some concerns. In fairness to it, the DUP at this stage — I might change my view in due course — has brought forward its proposals for the three strands, which have been discussed in the review. Like all the parties to the review, the DUP has to persuade other parties of the merits of some of the issues. Needless to say, I do not agree with many of the proposals the DUP has brought forward, but it is entitled to bring them forward. A point of view has been expressed that the DUP is trying to hollow away some of the North-South aspects of the Agreement, and I expressed my views on that directly to Dr. Paisley. All I can say is that I do not think he is doing that. Obviously, he is putting forward the party's negotiating stance, but I think the DUP is prepared to work to obtain consensus on these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">I have had a number of meetings with DUP representatives over the past six months and I think they are advanced now about moving forward from where I perceived them to be in the past. I have some concerns about the pace of events and whether the DUP is prepared to move quickly. I do not think I am misquoting the DUP, however, in saying that the key issues for it concern decommissioning and the ending of paramilitarism. In its overall thinking about North-South issues, the DUP has a more forward-looking view than I would have thought even a year ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">In reply to an earlier question the Taoiseach said: "They are not talking to each other." Will the Taoiseach please avoid giving the false impression that Sinn Féin was or is unprepared to talk to the DUP? He knows well that is not the case. Does the Taoiseach accept it is the DUP that is refusing to engage?</p>
            <p eId="para_147">Does the Taoiseach agree that substantive talks are essential at the earliest possible opportunity? Is he aware there is serious concern within a significant swathe of opinion, North and South, that substantive talks have been deferred until September, an agreement reached by the Taoiseach with the British Prime Minister to which Sinn Féin is opposed? Does the Taoiseach also accept that there is growing concern that this deferral is working to a DUP agenda, which wants to see repeated delays because that party is opposed to the Good Friday Agreement?</p>
            <p eId="para_148">Is the Taoiseach further aware that at a meeting of Lisburn City Council on 24 June, the Unionist majority once again excluded the representatives of all Nationalist opinion, including Sinn Féin and the SDLP, from every position of authority? Is he aware that, as a consequence, some 20,000 non-Unionist voters in the borough have effectively been disenfranchised? Will the Taoiseach advise whether a commitment was given by the Irish Government to have a representative at that council meeting? If it was made, it was not honoured. If this is the case, why did a Government representative who had been committed to attend to monitor the ongoing reality of sectarian discrimination within that borough not do so?</p>

            <p eId="para_149">Deputy Ó Caoláin is correct that it is the DUP which will not meet Sinn Féin rather than <i>vice versa</i>. I do not think I gave the impression the position was otherwise. Nevertheless, the effect is the same to me if the two parties do not meet each other and I am in the middle. I need not remind the Deputy why the DUP holds this view, on which it will move as soon as it sees progress on some of the other issues. It would be much more helpful to the Irish and British Governments if the party did not hold that position but we must live with it as best we can and make progress. It would help if we could get both parties to deal directly with each other. We succeeded in doing this after many years with the UUP, Sinn Féin, SDLP, PUP and Alliance and we made a great deal of progress. However, we must try to build on that progress despite that the DUP holds such a position.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">I read the DUP statement last Friday morning and noted its language, which referred to parity of esteem, its electorate and its electoral mandate. If I had put my hand over the DUP letterhead, it would have almost read the same as a Sinn Féin document from a few years ago in that it used the same words. Therefore, it seems the parties are at least reading each other's statements, even though they are not talking, because they are beginning to use the same language. As I said to Deputy Rabbitte earlier, I live in hope that the position will change quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">I am aware of what happened in Lisburn and how the operation of the votes in the council broke down. However, I am not aware of the issue of an Irish Government official to which the Deputy referred. I will look into the matter for him. Normally, our officials attend such meetings when they say they will and they attend most meetings. I will find out if a decision was made to hold someone back, but I doubt that is the case.</p>

Can it be the case that the Taoiseach would not know that instructions had issued from Dublin that the official was not to attend? Does the Taoiseach not agree that such a climbdown is unacceptable, particularly given that a commitment had already been extended to both of the Nationalist views represented on that council? Does he accept that significant anger and disappointment has clearly been caused in that area and within the politics of Sinn Féin and the SDLP?</p>

It means that, in July and August, one or other party is away, which is annoying.

The Taoiseach understands and has pointed out himself that, when the Assembly is not in operation, people become cynical. In that context, the SDLP recently proposed that the Assembly be restored and the relevant sections be run by administrators pending a return to the political masters and an agreement that it should be run politically.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_154">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_219">I chaired the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference meetings held in Brussels on 17 and 18 June at which I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche. The conclusions of the European Council and a consolidated version of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The major outcome of the meeting was clearly the agreement on the constitutional treaty which marked a milestone in the development of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Before addressing the issues on which our agreement was forged, I note that the process which led to the 18 June agreement on the treaty to establish a constitution for Europe characterised the best of the European Union. Each participant in the negotiations arrived at our meeting in Brussels on 17 June with the political will necessary to achieve agreement and engaged in positive and constructive dialogue. Every participant listened to and made significant efforts to understand the concerns of others. Even where concerns were not shared, they were understood and everyone was willing to make the accommodations necessary to allow agreement to emerge. All parties left the negotiations knowing their concerns had been listened to and that every effort had been made to accommodate them. At the conclusion, each participant could justifiably claim the proposed European constitution as his or her own and recognise that his or her imprint was firmly etched on the text.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">All parties were in a position to return home to begin the process of explaining the provisions of the European constitution comfortable in the knowledge that their interests and the interests of every other participant were reflected in the text. They were bringing home a constitution which in all its essentials retained the integrity of the European Convention outcome. Given that accommodating everyone's essential interests is the way the European Union does its business, our negotiations on the constitutional treaty constituted a classic EU exercise. Our collective success was particularly noteworthy as this was the first major test of the newly enlarged Union of 25 member states. The successful conclusion of these complex and critical negotiations proved that with political will, accommodation, compromise and hard work our enlarged Union can continue to forge win-win solutions for all member states and the people of Europe. Working together, we can continue to succeed for the European Union and all Europeans.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Our success in agreeing the European constitution constitutes a success for the people of Europe. The constitution brings the EU's basic law into one document for the first time and reflects the needs of a community of nations which has dramatically broadened its membership. That community will continue to expand and face new challenges into the future. The European constitution will enable the European Union to become more transparent and democratic. It sets out clearly the powers of member states and the EU and enshrines the fundamental rights of the citizen in the context of the Union's institutions. The constitution will enable the European Union to operate more efficiently and effectively and provide a framework in which the Union and all its people can grow and prosper into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I propose to set out for the House the process which led to the agreement, the main issues which remained outstanding as our meeting began on 17 June, the solutions found and the manner in which negotiations on the constitution dealt with those areas of the Convention text which were priorities for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">After the failure to agree at the December 2003 European Council, I consulted, assessed and reported to the March European Council on the prospects for progress in the Intergovernmental Conference. On foot of this report, the European Council reaffirmed its commitment to reaching agreement on the European Union Constitution and decided to do so no later than the June European Council. This pledge of political will to reach agreement during our Presidency was crucially important.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">In the period between the European Council meetings in March and June, formal negotiations resumed in the Intergovernmental Conference. Three ministerial level meetings of the IGC were held and an intense series of bilateral meetings continued during this period. I travelled to meet every one of my counterparts on the European Council in their capitals during May and June. These meetings allowed me to hear at first hand the views and concerns of my colleagues and to propose possible solutions to many of the issues they raised. Our officials continued to meet throughout the period, collectively or bilaterally.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">During the course of the negotiation we made it clear that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed. However, our objective, building on the excellent work of the Italian Presidency, was to move as many issues as possible from the open to the closed category. The ministerial meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference, chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, succeeded in moving off the negotiating table many issues on which we believed we had found solutions. In particular, they succeeded in reaching a broad understanding of where the deal would lie on the scope of qualified majority voting and unanimity.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">By the time of our meeting on 17 June, we were left with only a small number of highly sensitive issues. These included the size and composition of the Commission, the definition of qualified majority voting, the number of European Parliament seats and a range of non-institutional issues of concern to specific participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Negotiations continued through 17 and 18 June. In addition to plenary meetings, we had an intensive set of bilateral meetings. Eventually, late on 18 June we circulated a text proposing solutions to the remaining outstanding issues. At a short reconvened meeting of the IGC all participants indicated their agreement on the basis of our proposals. It was a moment of deep satisfaction for me, for my ministerial colleagues, and for our entire delegation. We felt we had achieved a good outcome for the Union and had underscored Ireland's capacity to play a valuable role at its heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I will now outline the solutions found on the main outstanding issues. On the European Commission, it was agreed that each member state will nominate a Commissioner until 2014. From then on, unless the European Council acting unanimously decides otherwise, the number of Commissioners will correspond to two thirds the number of member states. Membership of the Commission shall be on a strictly equal rotating basis, in line with what was already agreed at Nice. The Intergovernmental Conference also agreed a declaration on the Commission, intended to ensure consultation and transparency in Commission decision making when the Commission is reduced in size. Overall, this is a balanced arrangement, which reconciles the twin needs for efficiency and political legitimacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The solution found for the definition of qualified majority voting was to increase the member state and population thresholds in the convention text by 5% each and to add a number of safeguards. As a result, a qualified majority will require 55% of the member states, comprising at least 15 of them, and representing at least 65% of the population of the Union. A blocking minority must include at least four member states. In addition, a safeguard mechanism may be invoked by a substantial minority group of member states to allow more time to work for consensus at Council. This outcome reflects the particular concerns of certain member states, while creating a voting system which will be more transparent and effective than that agreed at Nice.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The solution found on the number of European Parliament seats was to increase the minimum number of seats allocated to six, to limit the maximum allocation of seats to a member state to 96, and to increase the total number of seats in the European Parliament from 736 to 750. The specific decision on the allocation of seats per member state will be taken by the European Council before the elections in 2009 on a proposal to be made by the European Parliament. This meets the special concerns of the smaller member states, while allowing enough future flexibility for reallocation if needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The non-institutional issues that required negotiation up until the end covered a number of economic governance issues, some of which emerged at a relatively late stage and a range of issues of specific interest to one or a small number of delegations. In the end, satisfactory solutions were found to all of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Ireland had a number of negotiating priorities in the Intergovernmental Conference on the text that emerged from the European Convention. Satisfactory solutions were found to all our priorities in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference. There was no issue of concern to Ireland outstanding as the negotiations entered their final stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">On taxation, we maintained a long-standing and well known position of requiring voting by unanimity in this critical area. We were successful on that. In the criminal law area, we wanted to enable the Union to act more effectively against serious cross-border crime, while ensuring that fundamental aspects of our legal system were respected. Again we were successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">In the security and defence area the outcome, which we negotiated during the Italian Presidency last year, also represents a significant success. In the negotiations we wanted to ensure that there would be no automatic commitments in breach of our traditional policy of military neutrality. At the same time, we wanted to ensure that the Union could be more effective in pursuit of peace and justice internationally, by developing its peace-keeping and crisis management capacities.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">With regard to the solidarity clause on natural and man-made disasters and terrorist attacks, which we welcomed, we wanted to ensure that any decisions with military implications would be taken by unanimity and that it would be for each member state to decide how to respond to a request for assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Each of our concerns was shared by one or more member states. I am happy to say that, during the course of the Intergovernmental Conference, solutions to these issues were found. Austria, Finland, and Sweden have all indicated their support for the result in this area. The outcome of the negotiations means there is no change in Ireland's security and defence policy. On all our principal negotiating objectives, therefore, we achieved what we set out to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The preamble to the European Constitution refers to Europe's religious inheritance. An issue that arose in our discussions, nonetheless, was the possibility of agreeing an enhanced reference to God or to Europe's Christian inheritance in the preamble. I favoured an enhanced reference. At the same time, I was adamant that such a reference could only be achieved through a genuine consensus. This was not an issue that should be divisive among the member states. In the end, no agreement was possible on an enhanced reference. However, we managed to ensure that Article 1.51 of the Convention text remained intact. This article is very important as it not only recognises the status of the churches, but establishes an open, transparent and regular dialogue with them. Both the Holy See and the Conference of European Catholic Bishops, while they would have liked an explicit reference to Christianity, have warmly welcomed the successful negotiation of the European Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">In addition to a successful Intergovernmental Conference we had a useful and productive European Council meeting. As Members know, it was not possible to reach a decision on the appointment of the President of the Commission at the European Council. Following further consultation and a meeting yesterday of the Council at the level of Heads of State or Government, we have now agreed that the Prime Minister of Portugal, José Manuel Barroso, will be nominated as President of the Commission to succeed Romano Prodi. Prime Minister Barroso has agreed to accept the nomination.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">José Manuel Barroso will be an excellent President of the Commission as he has all the qualities of vision and decisiveness required to do the job. On a personal basis, I am delighted with his appointment as I regard him as a personal friend and know that he is, and will remain, a friend of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Our meeting of the European Council on 18 June was addressed by the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox. As this was his last appearance at a European Council meeting, significant tributes were paid to the constructive role that he played in the European Parliament in advancing the legislative agenda in partnership with the Commission and the Council. On a personal basis, I take this opportunity to thank him for the advice and support he has given to me, in particular during the six months of the Irish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Following our exchange with Pat Cox, we had a discussion on terrorism. Our discussion was a follow-on from our meeting in March in the wake of the terrible terrorist bombings in Madrid, at which meeting we adopted a declaration on terrorism. At our recent meeting we reviewed the significant progress made. For example, in the 12 weeks between the two European Council meetings we adopted a directive on compensation to crime victims, we agreed an approach to the mutual recognition of confiscation orders, we re-established the Europol counter terrorism task force and we made substantial progress on establishing a European borders agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The European Council also reviewed our plans to continue to work on the full range of justice and home affairs issues in response to citizens expectations. It also launched the next phase in developing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. Our citizens want ever closer co-operation to fight terrorism and to tackle cross border crime. It is on issues such as these that the European Union gives added value to national efforts. The Union is indispensable in this area, if we are to deliver for our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">A wide range of other issues are dealt with in the conclusions of the European Council. These include a call on the European Commission to establish a European gender institute, the provisional conclusion of accession negotiations with Bulgaria, the decision to open accession negotiations with Croatia in early 2005, and a wide range of international issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I want to highlight one issue in particular. I was especially pleased that the European Council agreed that the European Union would continue to support the Northern Ireland peace process. On foot of the conclusions of our meeting, the European Commission will now examine how the PEACE II programme and the International Fund for Ireland can be aligned with other Structural Fund programmes ending in 2006. This agreement provides a basis for extending the programmes for a further two years from the end of this year. The conclusions of the European Council meeting represent the substantial body of work that has been advanced during the course of the Irish Presidency. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my Government colleagues for their efforts over the past six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">We are now in the final day of our Presidency. Tomorrow, at the National Forum on Europe, I will launch a report on Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, January to June 2004. I will arrange to have this publication circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas. At the beginning of the Presidency we set ourselves the challenge of keeping our citizens fully informed and engaged in regard to European Union developments, which affect our lives in so many ways. I hope that the transparent and open manner in which we have conducted the Presidency will be seen to have lived up to that challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The report shows that while the enlargement of the European Union and agreement on the constitutional treaty stand out, we made progress during our Presidency across the broad range of the European Union's policy areas. In some cases we exceeded the objectives we set ourselves. Our agenda going into this Presidency was broad and complex. On all the issues, including enlargement, the fight against HIV/AIDS, the establishment of peacekeeping missions, relations with other neighbours and global partners, we have sought to advance the Union's agenda. The conclusions we adopted at the European Council meeting on the 17 and 18 June give some flavour of the range of issues addressed and advanced. We also made significant progress in advancing the Union's economic, social and environmental agenda. In addition to our emphasis on jobs in the Lisbon Agenda process, Health Ministers, for example, delivered on the European health insurance card and Environment Ministers agreed measures to address climate change. In the justice and home affairs area, in addition to the terrorism issues addressed at the European Council earlier this month, a very significant body of work was completed on immigration, asylum, police co-operation, crime and action against drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">In the international area, the Presidency worked to develop the Union's relations with the wider world. I chaired five summit meetings during the course of the Presidency with Canada, Russia, the Latin American and Caribbean countries, Japan, and most recently last week with the United States. I represented the European Union at the G8 summit. The Tánaiste chaired a summit meeting with Switzerland in May and the Minister for Foreign Affairs chaired two foreign ministerial meetings in Ireland with our Asian and Mediterranean partners. In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs represented the European Union at over 30 ministerial meetings with key partners all over the world. The vitality of the EU-US relationship was demonstrated by the successful EU-US summit in Ireland at which economic relations and a broad range of international issues were discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">During our Presidency we worked to develop the Union's relations with the wider world through the development of policies aimed at promoting a fairer, peaceful and more secure world. We placed particular emphasis on strengthening support for the United Nations system. We also put a renewed emphasis on Africa and the Union's other development co-operation priorities, giving particular attention to the millennium development goals. We made a particular effort to encourage progress in the Middle East peace process, especially through the European Union's participation in the Quartet. While the situation on the ground still gives cause for concern, there is at least the prospect of progress in Israel's planned withdrawal from Gaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The figures show that some 80 legislative proposals were concluded with the European Parliament during the Irish Presidency. This represents 20% of all legislation adopted during the European Parliament's five-year term. We also placed emphasis on how to keep citizens better informed and engaged on European Union issues. This will be a continuing challenge and one that is shared across the European Union. I am delighted to see that the Netherlands' Presidency will follow-up on the initiative taken by Ireland in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The member states will now start the process of informing their public about the contents of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe. We are all committed to ratifying the constitution by 1 November 2006. The time between now and then will enable us to have a discussion in Ireland and across Europe on all aspects of the constitution. I look forward to the opportunity for a lengthy and informed debate. I look forward to it, in particular, because on this occasion we will be able to rely on the text of the constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The constitution sets out the values and objectives of the European Union in a way that the ordinary person on the street can understand. A clause that says that the Union's values are respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights is a clause that can be clearly understood by everyone. When the constitution states that the Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples, this too will resonate with all our people. I look forward to the lively debate that will inevitably surround the ratification of the constitution. I feel confident that when people become aware of the fundamentally good values in which our Union is rooted, support for the European Union will increase in Ireland and across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">We are now in the last day of our Presidency. I take this opportunity to thank all who have participated in making this a successful Presidency. I particularly thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, who spent most of the Presidency in the European Parliament. His was a difficult and time-consuming job, perhaps thankless in some regards because it is not always noted, but he did a really good job. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, also had to undertake an enormous amount of travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I also thank all the Ministers, Ministers of State, all our officials at every level and everybody working in the system, whether at home or abroad, whether they be gardaí, people providing security or anybody else. I also thank the main Opposition parties. They had this experience in 1996. They would understand the enormous effort required and appreciate that the results help the cause of this country. I do not believe the Presidency will come around for Ireland again for probably 15 years, unless things change. The year 2019 will probably be the next time Ireland will hold the Presidency and it will be different then because there will be a Union Foreign Minister and a President of the Council. We can say with some satisfaction this was a job well done and I thank everyone who participated and helped to make that possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_255">It is not usual in the House to give credit where credit is due, but I warmly congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government on achieving agreement on the constitutional treaty. It is something of which the Taoiseach can be truly proud. I am sure the House would agree that this achievement is a testament to the Taoiseach's negotiating skills, which, we are told, are legendary. I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in particular, and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the members of the Cabinet. I was a member of a Cabinet, which participated in the last Presidency. It is a pretty time-consuming and onerous responsibility for any Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">When the Taoiseach mentioned the next Presidency, I was reminded of his involvement on 1 January this year at a flag-raising ceremony in the square in Dublin Castle. Just before he stood to attention for the national anthem, Royston Brady's brass band came down the street playing "Yankee Doodle Dandy".</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I recall attending one of the EPP meetings in Brussels during the Italian Presidency where these very matters that were outstanding and causing difficulty came up for discussion. At the end of an interminable round of waffle about how it should be sorted out, people said that we should leave this to creativity and the imagination of Silvio Berlusconi. Obviously, the Italian imagination was not able to deal with this matter in the way that Irish diplomacy was able to do so. I again congratulate the Taoiseach on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">I also commend the legion of Irish officials whose brokering skills and diplomatic authority won over those EU members who remained recalcitrant. During the last Irish Presidency I was privileged to be a member of the then Cabinet and experienced first hand the tremendous talent and huge capacity for hard work of our public servants. They are the unsung heroes of this particular treaty negotiation and of the efficient management of this latest Irish Presidency. As a nation and a people, we owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I think the Taoiseach would agree that, thanks to the Convention on the Future of Europe, the procedure for preparing this treaty made reaching final agreement on it vastly easier than was the case with previous treaties. Valery Giscard d'Estaing brought together representatives of each state parliament, each state government, the European Parliament and EU institutions to greatly minimise the inevitable intergovernmental wrangling at summit meetings, and this welcome development will come into play in the preparation of all future treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I also pay tribute to all the members of the Convention for the valuable work they did in producing the draft treaty for submission to the Intergovernmental Conference. I pay particular tribute to a member of my party, Deputy John Bruton, who, as a member of the Convention's praesidium, played such a crucial role in developing the draft treaty. I am not sure if they were spurred on by Monsieur d'Estaing's assertion, inspired by the founding fathers of the US and the Philadelphia convention, that "This is what you need to do if you want people to build statues of you on horseback in the villages you all come from."</p>
          <p eId="para_264">We should pay particular tribute to Pat Cox, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude. His presidency of the European Parliament was exemplary. His work for Ireland was superb and in all matters relevant to Europe and this movement he performed his duties admirably.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">As a committed European, I am pleased that the new treaty extends further power and influence to the European Parliament. Today, I am proud to speak as leader of the Fine Gael Party because its five MEPs will have substantial leverage through their membership of the new Parliament's biggest and most powerful political family, the European People's Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Overall, however, I believe this constitutional treaty will be Europe's moment of truth. Agreeing the treaty may be one thing, but adopting it is another. Getting the people of Europe to adopt it — I very much hope they will — is the challenge that we, the politicians of Europe, nowface.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">In truth, the treaty turned out to be neither the tidying-up exercise envisaged by Britain nor the capstone of the federal state proposed by the Belgian Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt. Instead, the document, complete with its brake-accelerator mechanism, reflects what has been described as "the EU's unique hybrid nature: partly a federal union of citizens with federal institutions; partly an inter-governmental organisation rooted in member states." It represents an important step in bringing the EU closer to its citizens as it draws together the main provisions of all existing treaties into a single document. I hope the Taoiseach's nomination of José Barroso as President of the Commission and the latter's acceptance of the position will add greatly to that. I watched his body language over recent weeks at European People's Party meetings and those on the margins of those meetings indicated that both he and Prime Minister Schussel were serious candidates. I am glad Mr. Barroso has accepted the position and has received such support.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">This House is well aware of the provisions of the document itself. Among them are a provision for a full-time President of the European Council and a Foreign Minister with his or her own dedicated diplomatic corps. Therefore, let us address the issues this complex treaty document signifies as opposed to its provisions themselves. Perhaps for the first time in the history of the European Union it is the signified and not the signifier <i> per se</i> that is the challenge for the politicians and the people alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">With the newly-adopted treaty, the EU can no longer be regarded and therefore can no longer be sold to the electorate as some innocuous economic club, owned by the Governments of the various member states. Instead, the treaty signifies the EU as a political and legal entity of its own, with all that implies. The political dimension of the EU, as opposed to the social or economic dimensions, has become increasingly evident in recent years, yet here in Ireland we have failed to address the development of that dimension. It has been positively ignored and avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">There is absolutely no doubt that the EU is good for Ireland economically and socially, and that it should continue to be so. However, at this stage of acute transition in our Union, the economic argument is no longer the main argument. With the treaty, the argument becomes primarily political. In two years' time, when we vote on this treaty, we will answer one distinct question — Europe, are we for it or against it? How Ireland will answer will depend largely on how we, the politicians, engage with the public and communicate Europe and the political argument therefor to the electorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">With voter turnout in new member states running at 28%, and at 45% among the old-timers, we now hear that Europe is lacking a brand. There is, of course, some element of truth in that. However, I agree with the British MEP who said recently that we cannot try to sell the EU like some sort of washing powder. Rather, we need to engage in something far deeper than a rebranding exercise. For me, that "something far deeper" is raw politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Romano Prodi said after the elections that we must respond to the disenchantment of our citizens, and he is correct. However, our response must be at a higher level, beyond the traditional sell of pure economics, one-way benefit and the prospect of "What's in it for me?". As JeanMonnet put it, Europe is not a product but a process. Reducing Europe to the level of consumerism will not get us to where we need to be. We have a better chance with politics, which involves examining, debating, interpreting and re-interpreting what it is to be Irish and European, particularly, as I have said, at a time of growth and transition in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The tradition of individual rights is one of the great realisations of European civilisation but there is a danger for Europe and the EU when we start to ring-fence the rights and demands of the individual state without thinking about how they connect with the needs and the good of the whole. Therefore, at this stage in Monnet's process, it is time to communicate Europe and what it is to be European in a way that involves duty as well as rights and in a way that relates the good of the individual state to the greater good of the larger group. If we do not do so, we will begin to erode the political process and will do so at a crucial juncture.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Politics is all about recognising and respecting the other. Accommodating the other and compromising for the other within our diverse Union are what will be demanded of us more and more in the years ahead. I regard recognition, respect, accommodation and compromise as comprising both the human and humanising process of democratic politics. Given people's attitude to the EU, it is a process that people perceive to be missing. It is on how we explore and facilitate that human process that achieving agreement on the treaty rests, at home and everywhere else in the Union. The Union cannot survive if individual states become alienated from the centre of the Union, neither can it survive if the individual voter, the person, becomes totally alienated from what Europe is supposed to be. Therefore, we must address these people not just as voters but as individuals, each with his or her personal hopes, dreams, ambitions and fears. We must give them a reason to think about Europe, to debate the European ideal, to discuss their complex identity and their attachment to their country and continent in a new and meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">This is why we need to explore the higher ideal, the bigger picture. Selling this treaty could prove to be a way to redress the "dumbing-down" of politics, the slavish pandering to the lowest common denominator that has occurred on so many occasions over the past 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">In many ways, too, we must overcome our history. Historically and geographically, Ireland never had a shared sense of Europe, which involves a shared memory of the Inquisition, Napoleon, fascism and two world wars. However, as an island nation, we have been almost obsessively outward looking since the Dark Ages. It is not for nothing that we have produced a disproportionately high number of Nobel laureates for literature. In addition, despite our somewhat separate history, there is something we share with Europe other than our appreciation of the arts, namely, political happiness. This is a relatively new idea for us both.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Today, it is impossible for nations to live in isolation. We are all connected to the other. Europe has reached a time of self-examination, a time to take stock of who we are and where we are going as a community economically, socially and, crucially, politically. In the past, Europe has not just been split but sidelined in what were transforming moments of world history, including the two Gulf wars, for instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I am fully in favour of Europe's developing a common policy of security and defence. I am equally fully in favour of Ireland's being part of the negotiations that make up the architecture of that policy. Now that the elections are over, the Government, in its own time, should afford us the opportunity to have a debate on neutrality. Ireland is not neutral. It is unaligned and is the most vulnerable and helpless country in the EU. As has been pointed out by Deputy Gay Mitchell on many occasions, if Ireland were attacked tomorrow, our first call would have to be to NATO, an organisation of which we are not even a member. When it comes to Europe, it is high time we not only exercised our rights as Europeans but looked at how we can fulfil our responsibilities. On this issue, it is time we jolted ourselves out of our island lethargy.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I urge the Taoiseach and his Government to bring the debate on the constitutional treaty to the people in a real way as a matter of urgency. Ireland and Europe cannot afford a repeat of the first Nice treaty referendum where large numbers of people rejected the treaty for the simple reason that the Government was not in a position to explain to them what it was all about in a way they could understand fully and make an informed choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">We look at the formation of a new group of 31 Eurosceptic MEPs forming a bloc in the Parliament to prevent the treaty being ratified. Over the next two years we will, no doubt, have to endure much Eurosceptic rant here at home too. It is up to us, if we believe in the European ideal, to convince people that Europe is not about steamrolling national identities and homogenizing nations but about celebrating their diversity, that Europe is a place not of endless narrative but of real dialogue and that it is a place of simultaneous contrast and fusion. We must convince the people that Europe is their continent, their parliament, their Union and that they are theirs, ours, at a time of critical transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Every era of transition invents new forms — political, social, economic, technological, even philosophical. The map of Europe has changed radically in the past 30 years. What will it look like in 30 more? Will we, as a Union, have achieved and even exceeded the great ambitions outlined in the Lisbon agenda? The question is, do we want to be among the inventors of these new forms or mere observers? How we vote on the treaty will decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Referendum failure is not just possible in some countries, it is highly probable. Already, the Eurosceptic tide is flowing in Britain. Margaret Thatcher's Fortress Europe that would steamroll national identities is obviously and curiously alive in a section of British society. Equally, I know from discussions with my colleagues in the European People's Party, that a "no" vote may well ensue among some of the new member states who will have great difficulty in ratifying the constitutional treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">It is up to countries like us to take the lead and renew our commitment to the European ideal. It is thanks to that ideal that this generation can cross borders that for their parents and their parents before them remained firmly closed and which, in some parts of Europe, people gave their lives to cross, literally and metaphorically. As the world knows to its cost, borders of the mind remain and I would like to see the new enlarged Europe help break them down. At one of our recent EPP meetings most of the leaders and prime ministers agreed on the fundamental issue that what we have concluded here for Europe is central to the original European ideal of getting away from the wars which caused so much havoc in Europe over the centuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The new Europe needs this constitutional treaty to be carried by the electorate if the Union is to function in an efficient and relevant way. We could limp along on our existing legal base, but that is not enough. The treaty is necessary if the Union is to be as flexible, as efficient, as transparent and accessible to the citizens as it possibly can be.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I realise that in some Government quarters we may be bankrupt of useful ideas but the people of Ireland and Europe should not have to pay the price of their being equally bankrupt of ideals. Give the people the information and let us have a real debate. Insofar as we can help that process, this party will be only too willing to co-operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The need is urgent. I ask those who say it is not to remember the story President Kennedy once told about a certain French marshall, who, one day, asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardener objected on the grounds that the tree was slow growing and would not reach maturity for 100 years. "In that case", the marshall replied, "there is no time to lose. Plant it this afternoon."</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_289">I congratulate the Taoiseach on what he has achieved. The Irish Presidency is to be congratulated for managing successfully to take advantage of an evident renewal of commitment among the governments of the old and the new member states and of certain fortuitous developments, such as the change of Government in Spain, to see the work of the intergovernmental conference brought quickly to a conclusion. Both the finalisation of an agreed text for a constitutional treaty and an agreed nomination for the Presidency of the European Commission in the midst of a remarkable degree of rancour between certain heads of government are noteworthy and are deserving of unbegrudging congratulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">It is fair too to add that work of the kind could not be undertaken by the Taoiseach alone. The Minister of State with responsibility for Europe and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and his team performed at the highest level throughout the process and represented Ireland with distinction. We are fortunate in Ireland that our diplomatic corps, though among the smallest in Europe, is also among the very best. The Taoiseach and his colleagues were well served throughout this process by dedicated public servants and advisers and it is appropriate that congratulations should also be extended to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I do not intend to minimise the achievement of the Irish Presidency when I add, however, that in many ways the real difficulty starts now. Securing agreement among 25 Heads of Government was, no doubt, a complex and difficult task. Securing support for that agreement among the parliaments and electorates of 25 different nations will require vision, leadership, and communications of the highest order.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">It remains to be seen, for example, whether the compromise choice of candidate for the Presidency of the EU Commission has those abilities. I understand that the Taoiseach, for instance, has received a letter from Poul Rasmussen, president of the Party of European Socialists, expressing some reservations about the choice of Prime Minister Barroso. Those reservations are not based on personality differences, but on the deeply held view that the next President of the EU Commission must have a number of important qualities. They include proven experience in promoting the European project, a strong belief that strengthening Europe's competitiveness can and must go hand in hand with social responsibility and security, the capacity to communicate the vision of Europe across an enlarged membership and the capacity to better gather diverse political forces in favour of shared European objectives. I recognise that the Taoiseach was anxious to complete the Irish Presidency by bringing forward an agreed candidate. It is to be hoped the right choice was made and that the urgency of completing the task did not in the end compromise the best possible choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">What has been achieved in the form of a new European constitution deserves to be studied carefully. The operation of the constitution will have direct and indirect ramifications for the welfare of every European citizen from now on, assuming it is ratified. The comments I will make in the course of this discussion are, to that extent, preliminary ones. I make these comments recognising two basic underlying points. First, the constitution as it stands does not transfer any new powers from the member states to the European Union but sets out to make it more democratic and to simplify its procedures. The Union's powers remain limited to those, which are conferred on it by the member states in order to attain objectives they have in common. Second, the constitution does not subvert national constitutions but attempts to provide added value, a stronger European dimension to the rights citizens currently enjoy.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Against that background, the highlights of the new constitution might be summarised as follows: the Charter of Fundamental European Rights will be legally binding; the Union will acquire a full-time President of the European Council, who will be able to co-ordinate the European policy of Governments more efficiently; the Union will acquire its own foreign minister who will be able to instil greater solidarity within the foreign, security and defence policy areas; the President of the European Commission must have the support of a broad majority within the European Parliament; the Parliament will rule on over 95% of EU laws, which is more than double the Nice figure; the Council will be able to rule on 95% of EU legislation by majority voting, which is almost double the Nice figure; the EU's legal capacity in the areas of asylum and migration and in the battle against international crime and terrorism has been significantly stepped up; the apportioning of responsibilities between the EU and member states will be arranged more clearly; decision making procedures will be greatly simplified, with their number reduced from 15 down to four; and the Union's legal capacity will be enhanced inside and out. European decision-making procedures will become more democratic and more transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Underpinning these changes is the fact that the change in balance and focus now in prospect for the Union is very significant, even though it may still not be fully appreciated by many of its citizens. Geographically, culturally and in economic terms the enlarged Union will have a new centre of gravity. Disparities of income and development will be sharper and the concept of cohesion will require to be defined afresh. Community policy and the budget will have to be reshaped and there are likely to be new issues as yet unforeseen.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The history of the EU stretching back to the old EEC is one of a succession of changing circumstances coping with enormous challenges. There were the challenges of structurally changing the shapes of agriculture and heavy industry — coal and steel — in the original European Economic Community. There were the development and regional issues that arose with the accession of states such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece. There was the project of social Europe and the Single Market and there was the enormous ambition of establishing a single currency. The Community, the Union did not flinch from such major projects and it succeeded.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Those successes should not blind us to the enormity of the next project. Success raises expectations in the new states. In addition, the sheer scale of enlargement now accomplished, combined with the level of integration established within the existing Union, makes for a far more complex agenda. There are likely to be new issues as yet unforeseen. There will, of course, be new opportunities, whether in trade and commerce, social intercourse and cultural exchange, as a result of this vast expansion. There is also the gain of stabilisation and peace. That is the point of it all in the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">One cannot, of course, talk about peace without addressing the continuing issue of the war in Iraq. It may well be the case that the President of the United States, having launched a massive military adventure whose consequences were feared by everyone but himself and the people immediately around him, is now coming to realise that he must make peace, at least with those in the European Union who stood out against this war from the beginning. However, if Europe is to place more emphasis on its future deliberations on the management of situations in the foreign, security and defence areas, it is vital that those deliberations be founded on some level of principle as well as strategic interests. There is a simple and inviolable principle regarding the war in Iraq. The war is wrong and Ireland was wrongto support it through the use of ShannonAirport.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The war was wrong on grounds of international law, wrong on grounds of morality and wrong because it degenerated into an assault against the most basic principles of our common humanity. All over the world people in their millions have condemned with their feet, and in public, the excessive use of military power. Iraqi civilians, children, women and men, have died. Unofficial estimates suggest a figure of 15,000 deaths. Approximately 1,000 youngsters from the US and Britain have also given their lives for this war. The bottom line in all of this, which may well preoccupy Europe in years to come, is that the world has become a less safe place as a result. The war on terrorism has produced more terrorists; the inhuman treatment of prisoners has produced a barbaric response; and the war itself is spilling over into neighbouring countries, with potentially catastrophic effects.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">If the new Europe, a massive economic entity, is to face the future with confidence, that entity must be able to develop relationships with the rest of the world that are based on principles of justice and respect. Europe stands between the neo-conservative impulses of some leading American policymakers, on the one hand, and the blind hatred of some in the Muslim world on the other. That is a potentially lethal mix, some of the consequences of which we have already seen. Unless there is the beginnings of a new dialogue and draconian security is accompanied by a commitment to justice and solidarity, and unless the alienation of the entire Muslim world is recognised and understood, far worse consequences lie ahead of us. As I said earlier, we will no doubt debate these issues many times.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Ireland will make its decision on the European constitution by way of a referendum of the people and we will need to debate the constitution in detail in that context. Before I conclude, however, let me draw attention to one welcome and positive development that I mentioned earlier, namely, that the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights will be legally binding. The charter sets out in a single text, for the first time in the European Union's history, the whole range of civil, political, economic and social rights of European citizens and all persons resident in the EU. These rights are divided into six sections — dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens' rights and justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The right to human dignity, to the integrity of the person, to protection from discrimination, to fair and just working conditions and many others are set out in the charter in clear and accessible language. Putting the charter into the constitution and giving it legal effect in terms of principle, is a fundamental step. Putting flesh on the bones of those principles and turning idealistic commitments into legislative and political action, will take time and political will. Political will involving the determination to make the new Europe work, will be more important than ever in the future. The legitimate demands made by new members, the wider disparities of income in the enlarged Union, and the challenges of immigration and free movement will lead to stresses and strains in the months and years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The combination of challenges within the Union and grave risks surrounding the Union will require leadership and vision of the highest order. The negotiation of a new constitution, containing as it does the promise that the people of Europe will have a clearer understanding of how the Union works, is a good start. The safe, secure development of a prosperous, fair and democratic Union in the years ahead will demand clearer constitutional language. In that sense, the constitutional developments we welcome today, and that will be debated throughout Europe over the next two years, are the first of many building blocks that are needed.</p>

        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_304">Let me add to what the leader of the Labour Party has already said by making observations on a number but not all of the areas of importance. First, I wish to be associated with the congratulatory remarks to all involved. On a previous occasion, I congratulated the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I take this opportunity to congratulate the Taoiseach on the extraordinary task he has performed, one, which we doubted was possible to achieve back in January when we started to debate the Irish Presidency. It was, I think, Deputy John Bruton who offered the prospect of a substantial place in history if the Taoiseach succeeded in getting the treaty through and he has succeeded. That is very good for Europe and as the Taoiseach stated in his speech, it is very good for Ireland because we are seen as a country that can make a contribution, not through military strength or massive economic power but by the ability to empathise and relate to others.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The Taoiseach did not do this on his own but without his skills, less would have been achieved. I acknowledge the role of Mr. Valery Giscard D'Estaing and all the people in the Convention, including the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. A great deal of work was done and the way in which the Irish relationship was developed with the smaller member states, particularly the applicant countries, is something that should not go unnoticed.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">We should reflect on the ways we can celebrate this Irish achievement because as the Taoiseach rightly said, there will not be another Irish Presidency like this. In fact, when the treaty goes through and I believe it will go through, the role of nation states and the Presidency of the Union must be reviewed in a fundamental way. We are completing today a period of European history that in time must be measured and studied. I hope that the documents, data and memories are being properly stored in the archives, so that in time they can be fully analysed.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">There is a realisation among the present Administration in the United States that whatever about winning a military victory, securing a democratic peace in Iraq requires multilateral engagement and co-operation. That lesson is painful for the Americans, particularly for some of those in the current Administration. That anger was manifest in Dromoland Castle.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">That some of the Taoiseach's officials saw it at first hand from a United States Administration that was not used to the kind of questioning it received from the RTE journalist, Carole Coleman, is an indication of that. Perhaps through that interview and many others, they will learn that if they want to co-operate with other people, they must be open and co-operative themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The turn has come. Whatever about the past and the war which Deputy Rabbitte rightly criticised, we are where we are now. The reconstruction of a balanced relationship between Europe and America on a raft of issues is essential. Good work was done in Dromoland in that context. There is much more to do, particularly in the area of trade and co-operation in the World Trade Organisation on the Doha round where we must dismantle the subsidies to European, American and Japanese farmers to open up the round for prosperity and peace for emerging countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I take issue with what Deputy Kenny said about neutrality and terrorism. He misread, perhaps inadvertently, one of the most significant components in the treaty, namely, the solidarity clause in respect of man-made and natural disasters and acts of terrorism. If, Heaven forbid, we were to be attacked by an act of terrorism, it would not be to NATO we would make the first call but to the institutions of the European Union. What delivery of support and service would be needed would be a matter for the people who have the capacity to so deliver, but the clause is clear. We have now committed ourselves to an act of solidarity to all other 24 member states and the candidate countries of Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and perhaps even Turkey. It will be to the European Union institutions and not to NATO. If members of NATO wish to offer support through the co-ordination, command structure and integrated communications systems of NATO to deliver the assistance which we sought in the first instance, that would be a matter for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I suggest to the Taoiseach and to the House that, in marking this Presidency and this phase in our European evolution, the European flag which was brought in for the commemoration of the Irish Presidency should remain in both these Chambers, in the committee rooms and in every public building such as local authority buildings and county council offices. I suggest that the European flag be placed side by side with the tricolour. This would mark the Irish achievement in bringing home the constitutional treaty but also the permanent recognition that we now belong to a Union of member states as well as the nation of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">I join previous speakers in congratulating the Taoiseach and the Irish Presidency for their work and for the negotiating achievement of a new EU constitution. I wish the new Commission President, the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr. José Manuel Durão Barroso, well in his new post. Bhí mé den tuairim go mbeadh baill eile san Aontas Eorpach le rialtais eile ag iarraidh buíochas a ghabháil leis an Taoiseach agus leis an Aire, an Teachta Cowen, agus an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Roche, agus na státseirbhísigh a d'oibrigh chomh crua sin le linn na hUachtaránachta. Chuir mé an cheist, agus cuirim arís í, nach mbeadh stádas oifigiúl don teanga Ghaeilge oiriúnach mar chomhartha buíochais? Tá ionadh orm nach bhfuil sé sin bainte amach in ainneoin na rudaí eile ar fad.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The Green Party is not opposed to an EU constitution in principle and, over the coming months, the party will be analysing the final draft agreed at the EU Council and holding a special convention to determine the party's final stance on the issue. However, before the constitution was finalised, we expressed a number of concerns and it does not appear that these have been adequately dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The Green Party still has concerns about the new position of EU President, as had most participants in the Convention, and the end of rotating EU Presidencies. The new EU Foreign Minister and the loss of a European Commissioner to Ireland in the future are also of concern. We believe this will weaken the influence of member states and our Parliament. We are not convinced that this will rectify the EU's democratic deficit. It will do the opposite instead. However, we welcome the increased powers given to the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Another major issue is that of environmental protection and the pursuit of policies which promote sustainability. A group of environmental non-governmental organisations, NGOs, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, World Wide Fund for Nature, the Climate Action Network Europe, BirdLife International, International Friends of Nature, European Environmental Bureau, and the European Federation for Transport and Environment put together proposals for a green EU constitution. I am sorry to say that there appears to have been little attention paid to their concerns which are shared by the Green Party — An Comhaontas Glas. EU institutions appear to be the main focus of attention rather than policy areas. In the areas of energy, transport, agriculture and fisheries policy, for example, there is a need to ensure that these are pursued in an environmentally sustainable fashion, including strengthening the precautionary and polluter pays principles, encouraging the harmonisation of health, safety, environmental and consumer protection upwards, and ensuring that agricultural production is rationally and sustainably developed. The constitution falls short in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">We are also disappointed that the protocol on sustainable development proposed by Environment Commissioner, Margot Wallström, never materialised. The most upsetting is the retention and promotion of the EURATOM Treaty in a protocol to the constitution. This is an outdated pro-nuclear treaty which should be phased out and not appended to the new constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I note that Austria and Germany have added a declaration calling for a conference to be held of the member states to consider necessary amendments to the EURATOM Treaty and this is a positive development. Why was the Irish Government not party to this declaration? Will the Taoiseach clarify the Government's position on this matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The Green Party — An Comhaontas Glas — has always strongly objected to the militarisation of the EU and this constitution certainly does not allay our fears on this score. We take issue with those who argue that this constitution is only a tidying-up exercise which brings together all the previous treaties in a readable, comprehensive format. There are a number of innovations in a broad number of areas and this is particularly the case with EU defence issues. Member states are obliged to progressively improve their military capabilities, an obligation which could cost low defence spending countries such as Ireland a considerable amount of money. A European armaments, research and military capabilities agency is established which is directed at improving the EU's military capabilities and to bolster the European defence industry. Structured co-operation, a two-tiered defence structure, is established for the first time, allowing states to form mini military alliances using the EU's institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The Petersberg Tasks, which list the duties of the EU's rapid reaction force, have been expanded even further, including supporting third countries in combating terrorism in their territories. A military solidarity clause appears to promote the doctrine of pre-emption. We continue to have the major concern that the failure of the EU and its constitution to require a UN mandate for the despatch of the rapid reaction force abroad is an undermining of the United Nations and that the close association and integration of EU defence with the NATO nuclear alliance is wrong. We have long called for the Irish Government to insert a protocol like that inserted by Denmark which would exempt Ireland from the military and defence elements of the EU, including paying for these military developments and operations. We still support such a protocol and the inclusion of Irish neutrality in the Irish Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">What has become of the Irish Government's protocol on abortion, which was annexed to the earlier treaties? Does the Government believe that the welcome Charter of Fundamental Rights, which lists under Article 2, right to life, that everyone has the right to life and no one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed, replaces the Irish protocol? I would have thought this was a dubious argument given that the 25 member states have signed this constitution yet a number of these states have legalised abortion. Will the Government clarify the position because I know it will be raised in discussions</p>
          <p eId="para_322">All the arguments about structures, trade, budget, come to naught if the EU is not made sustainable. I understand the Taoiseach has been under a great deal of pressure and has had little time off. If he has an afternoon or evening off, I recommend he goes to see "The Day after Tomorrow" in the cinema.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_325">Last Thursday, when I raised concern with the Minister about the process involved in concluding this treaty, he complained that I alone had failed to congratulate the Irish Presidency for a job well done. Allow me to clarify. I did not congratulate the Government on the outcome, superficially impressive though it is, because it is not a good deal and I do not congratulate people on bad deals. The Government failed to directly represent Ireland's national interests and instead, in a dereliction of its duty to the people, it relied for six months on the goodwill of other member states' delegations to speak and negotiate on our behalf. Why? The Government was willing to sacrifice the national interest if need be for the international prestige associated with concluding a deal. That is the reason it accepted such a bad deal. Sinn Féin wanted a deal truly worthy of enthusiastic support, one which could unite Irish people and others around a vision for the future development of the European Union. In its thirst for prestige and approval by the large states, the Government wanted a deal for which it could claim credit and thereby enhance its standing, regardless of the outcome or its implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I accept the constitutional deal could have been worse in that it could have immediately established a federal united states of Europe, as some people had advocated. Instead, it takes a further step along this route and while it could have been worse, it could also have been much better. For example, we wanted a treaty which would eliminate the democratic deficit, reverse the militarisation of the European Union and, at minimum, accord parity of esteem to the militarily neutral states. We also wanted it to signal an all-out assault on internal poverty in the EU and guarantee social protections, while not only allowing member states the freedom to take whatever steps necessary but also providing a commitment to actively assist them, to achieve internal social and economic equality and inclusion as a matter of top priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">We wanted a treaty which would guarantee fair trade but, above all, one which would act as a charter for a European Union of equals, in which Ireland could proudly participate without reservation. Instead, we got a treaty which increases the democratic deficit, significantly extends the competence of the EU and confers no real powers on national parliaments to intervene to stop measures prejudicial to the people they represent. In addition, it significantly accelerates the militarisation of the European Union and advances its establishment as a military superpower. Instead of eliminating internal poverty, the treaty will establish the EU as an economic superpower and ensure the market remains king. It is likely to accelerate rather than halt the pressure to privatise basic essential services such as water, health and education. Fundamentally, the treaty retains institutional inequality between member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Sin an fáth go ndúirt mé gur dhroch-chonradh é seo. Seo an fáth nach bhfuil agus nach mbeidh pobal an Aontais ag tacú leis seo agus ag tacú le forbairtí an Aontais sa treo seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Is trua nár thapaigh an Taoiseach an deis nuair a bhí sé ag déanamh cinnidh maidir le hUachtarán an Choimisiúin bean a roghnú don phost. Níl mé ag caitheamh anuas ar an chinneadh atá déanta aige agus guím gach rath ar Uachtarán an Choimisiúin nua, José Barroso, ach ní raibh aon bhean san iomaíocht agus is trua é sin. Bhí deis ag an Taoiseach a thaispeáint go bhféadfadh sé seasamh dearfach a ghlacadh agus bean a mholadh. Tá an deis aige fós an cinneadh ceart a dhéanamh nuair atá sé ag ainmniú Choimisinéar na tíre seo. Tá a lán ban leis na cailíochtaí cearta ann, roinnt acu fiú ina pháirtí féin agus i bhfad eile níos mó lasmuigh agus tá súil agam go roghnóidh sé bean le taispeáint go bhfuil sé sásta cinnireacht a ghlacadh ar cheist céimeanna dearfacha chun mná a chur chun cinn agus chun an cothrom is ceart a thabhairt do mhná i bpolaitíocht.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I will offer no congratulations on the Irish Presidency. When a distinctive, fresh and dynamic alternative vision of the European Union was needed and wanted by the Irish people, we had instead a lapdog Presidency, one which loyally served the interests of the core states and vested interests and challenged no one on the big issues. While some undoubtedly worthwhile initiatives were associated with the Presidency and deserve credit, overall it was characterised as conciliatory to the major powers, both in the EU and the wider world. In the final analysis, it represented a failure of courage and vision and will be remembered as such.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_331">The Irish Presidency of the European Union is generally being hailed as a success, even a triumph, for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government. Why would right-wing political parties throughout Europe, editors of the capitalist owned media, conservative opinion generally, captains of industry and multinationals not regard the Presidency as a triumph for them above all?</p>
          <p eId="para_332">After tortuous and hardly edifying horse-trading the Taoiseach has succeeded in installing as President of the European Commission, Senhor José Manuel Barroso, an arch-conservative advocate of a largely untrammelled capitalist market, a supporter of the United States invasion of Iraq — he set the platform for Messrs. Bush and Blair to launch their criminal invasion — and a man who leads Portugal having imposed a regime of severe austerity on the Portuguese working class in the interests of the country's capital. That is not a victory for working people in the European Union. The Taoiseach has succeeded with his colleagues in installing at the top of the European Union a person who is completely at variance with the view of a large majority of Europeans on critical issues, of which Iraq is just one example.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The proposed EU constitution, the final version of which we have not had sight of despite looking for it, consolidates the neo-liberal economic agenda which has been gathering pace for many years in the EU and, therefore, consolidates the drive towards the privatisation of public services. We must still tease out in greater detail the implication of some last minute changes for crucial public services, how the Common Commercial Policy will impact on our public services and the possibility of pressure being applied to privatise increasing numbers of our public services. While some changes were made, we will not know their significance until they are teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The proposed draft constitution the Irish Presidency succeeded in having adopted undoubtedly substantially advances the militarisation of the European Union. It is an outrage that this country is associated with open advocacy of more spending on armaments, weapons of mass destruction and the criminal obscenity by which between €50 billion and €60 billion per annum is already wasted on the production of weapons.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Thousands of European scientists and manufacturing workers are, on a daily basis, trying to create even more vicious weapons than those to hand currently. It is also an outrage that the Irish Presidency advanced the European Union's research and military capabilities body, which puts paid to the claim that the Government takes seriously the question of neutrality.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">One of the shameful acts of the final days of the Presidency was to use the EU-US summit to whitewash the criminal invasion of Iraq by the US and Britain. The Dromoland summit, therefore, set the basis for the NATO summit that followed. The Presidency said in its final days that the deaths of 10,000 Iraqis and the maiming of countless others is in the past even though this all occurred in the past 18 months and it is time for us to move on because it is business as usual. That was absolutely shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The Taoiseach has serious questions to answer as he hands over the Presidency. I would like him to elaborate on his statement to the press following the Dromoland summit that he was completely satisfied with answers given to him by President Bush about the treatment of prisoners. Was the Taoiseach informed whether the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, at which psychological and other torture is practised on people who are incarcerated without charge or trial and without recourse to relatives to friends — though they may have the opportunity to be represented by lawyers following the US Supreme Court decision on Monday — will be closed or is he satisfied that the regime in Guantanamo Bay can continue? What did the Irish Presidency mean when it stated to the European people that the questions relating to prisoner treatment in US camps had been answered to its satisfaction? Unfortunately, the impact of this statement was to gloss over and whitewash the crimes of the imperial invaders of Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I look forward to the referendum debate. I hope we have time to tease out many of the issues hidden in the constitution and their implications for working people in Ireland and throughout Europe.</p>

Will the Minister elaborate on that? Will he comment on the scramble time in Ireland and other member states in the event of an attack? Under the constitution member states will have an equal standing and, therefore, every aspect of the Union's unity must be protected in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I refer to the question of euroscepticism and how to tackle it head on to rediscover the European ideal. In the wake of the discovery of freedom, the next discovery should be the ideal of cohesion and collective support rather than pursuing the disruptive course of those who have gone down the road of scepticism to make it a stock in trade.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">No consideration has been given by the Government to the timing of a referendum in Ireland. The Taoiseach outlined the timeframe involved for ratification of the constitution, which is two years from the time of signature, as I stated in reply to parliamentary questions last week. It is important that the time available should be used for an informed debate. The Forum on Europe and other bodies, which have been more effective in communicating European issues and the bones of the Nice treaty, should be used in the coming months to make people more aware of what is involved, thereby avoiding the extremist interpretations that are often put forward as fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">With regard to enlargement, we closed all chapters with Bulgaria and made progress with the Romanians. They hope to conclude their negotiations during the Dutch Presidency in the next six months. There has not been a decoupling of Bulgaria and Romania. A single accession treaty will be agreed, preparation of which will begin in July.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">On the issue of negotiations between the countries based on the "own merits" principle, no decoupling of the countries has taken place and a single accession treaty is being drafted for both. That work will begin in July subject to Romania and Bulgaria being able to confirm they will be ready to proceed with full membership in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">We await the Commission opinion on Turkey in October, which will allow the Council to consider in December whether accession negotiations should begin with Turkey. It is always emphasised that the Copenhagen criteria apply. These are objective criteria and successive conclusions from the European Council have reported the progress being made by the Turkish Government in its legislative programme and the reforms it must undertake to meet these criteria. Clearly apart from legislative acts, the realities on the ground need to be confirmed, particularly those affecting minority languages, education issues, freedom of the churches, etc. Much progress has been reported and a final decision will be taken later in the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Thessaloniki points out that the western Balkans region can have a European perspective. Obviously in the longer term we need to enhance regional co-operation there. In the first instance the recent elections in Serbia make for a more promising prospect in that regard. Clearly issues remain concerning Kosovo and Bosnia where the EU will take over the mission from NATO.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">A wider neighbourhood policy has been devised to propose how we should deal with our neighbours. As various action plans for specific countries are in preparation, this is not a "one size fits all" approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The issue of defence and security was tabled during the Italian Presidency and no change in substance has been made in the period since. The arrangements explicitly acknowledge and respect the different traditions of member states — those that are neutral and those that are members of NATO — and state clearly that the specific character of member states in this regard shall not be prejudiced. The arrangements for structural co-operation whereby member states undertake to improve their capabilities so as to be able to take part in missions for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter are open and inclusive and allow member states to make contributions in different ways. I was asked what time was involved in our emergency planning. I suggest that a question be tabled to the Minister for Defence who has that responsibility and has prepared and updated our emergency planning arrangements in the aftermath of terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">On the question of euroscepticism, it is it important to point out to public opinion here that many other parts of the world look to the European Union arrangements as being the most advanced and successful regional arrangements anywhere. Given the globalising nature of the century in which we live, deep integration of economies throughout the world is taking place with regions becoming more connected. I was in south Asia, where there is talk of establishing a south Asia free trade area as a prelude to more institutional arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Where conflict or violence exists, there is poverty. In many cases these conflicts distort what would be natural trade patterns between neighbours. The level of interaction and trade between Pakistan and India is only between 5% and 10% of what it should be. Rather than listening to eurosceptics who try to suggest we can all be an island, we should listen to others who look on Europe as a success story in multi-nation governance in the globalised world in which we live. Now that we have a constitutional framework we should try to ensure it works effectively and get a policy implemented that is meaningful to the ordinary lives of citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">I wish to put another view on the European constitution. Does the Minister accept that some people in this State have genuine major concerns? There seems to be a cosy consensus both in Government and in the broader elite in Irish society, much of which is dismissive arrogance and political snobbery. Those who question the EU or the constitution are accused of being out of line with the people. It is suggested that they should not be listened to and are described as sceptics and cynics. I hope we will have a real debate about the issues involved with the European constitution. It is important that the Minister knows that some people have genuine concerns, do not always go with the flow and will question issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">My final question concerns the privatisation of public services. Many in the trade union movement and in the community and voluntary sector have concerns that we will suddenly move towards the privatisation agenda and the facts speak for themselves at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">I have no problem with having a rational debate with those who have genuine concerns. However, during his contribution today, Deputy Ó Snodaigh suggested some other treaty was available that was not negotiated but could have been negotiated. The treaty that is negotiated is where the consensus of the 25 member states resides. It is fine for a political party in Ireland to believe it should be off on some other axis. However, the Deputy should not suggest it was available to be negotiated.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_364">I have heard Sinn Féin suggest we should have a Europe of equals with one vote each in the European Council. It calls that equality. So Luxembourg with 400,000 people and Germany with 80 million people should both have one vote and it calls that equality. That would not be equality. It is not just about a union of states but also a union of citizens. The purpose of the new decision-making process is to reflect the need for 55% of the states and 65% of the citizens to agree. That is a weighting system that respects states and citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Up to now larger countries did not have a weighting commensurate with their numbers of citizens and this is still the case. Germany reduced the number of seats it should have had in the European Parliament. It had been allocated 99 seats under the Nice treaty and the German Chancellor offered to give back three seats if it would help. Six seats each were given to Malta and Luxembourg. On any measure of equality it is clear what the situation is. If Malta can have six seats, Germany should be entitled to more than 300 seats. However, we could not have a parliament on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">If we are to have a debate on the concerns, let us deal with the facts. I have no problem in discussing with those with a different political perspective from me on the basis of the facts but not on the basis of some sphinx that is generating hot air that has no relevance to the treaty. I am not dismissive of people in general. However, I am dismissive of people who accuse me of arrogance. What in the treaty indicates that such a big conspiracy took place? It has been suggested here that we have not defended our national interests. Of course we defended out national interests. On every issue on which we had concerns, we won. We won on tax, defence and security, and the institutions, where our concerns have been respected. About what are the Deputies talking?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_368">I am answering the question as to whether I accept that people have concerns. The Deputy suggested that the constitution would provide for the privatisation of important public services. For the first time the constitution recognises the importance of such services. A new article, Article 3.6, on services of general economic interest notes the place they occupy as "services to which all in the Union attribute value". The Union and its member states are committed within their respective spheres of responsibility to, "take care that such services operate on the basis of principles and conditions, in particular economic and financial, which enable them to fulfil their missions". Some member states' governments, including the Swedish and others, wanted to ensure that these sorts of freedoms at the national level were included and we supported that.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">In response to the idea that the new constitution is too pro-business, without proper focus on the social dimension, the new constitution strikes a fair and reasonable balance. Article 3.3, which sets out the Union's objectives states that it shall work for, "the development of Europe based on balanced economic growth, a social market economy, highly competitive and aiming at full employment and social progress, and with a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment." Thus, the need for economic growth is balanced by the need for social and environmental protection. Furthermore, for the first time, and with strong Irish support, the constitution contains an Article which requires the Union, in defining and implementing all of its policies, to "take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion and a high level of education, training and protection of human health."</p>
          <p eId="para_370">This new horizontal social clause has potentially far reaching significance. It has been welcomed by those working in the social sectors as having real meaning, and the Deputy mentioned the voluntary sector. The European Anti-Poverty Network in particular has thanked the Government for its efforts to ensure that such a provision was included.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">There is an idea that we are heading for a more militarised European Union. The outcome includes the set of proposals in the area of defence which were tabled during the Italian Presidency, and our position is totally respected there. No automaticity is being imposed on us in any of these areas. We make our sovereign decisions on a case by case basis, consistent with our foreign policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">In regard to independent foreign policy, the important thing in foreign policy is to find allies for one's cause so that one can influence events. We can do far more as a country in trying to influence the situation in the Middle East with allies in the European Union, which is now a global actor, than we can alone. Does anyone seriously suggest we have the same weight of influence as the European Union in foreign policy matters? What world are we living in? We do not. We work with allies in the European Union to promote our objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The values and objectives of the Union are totally consistent with our own, and nobody would disagree with them in this House. We use all of the instruments — political, economic and diplomatic — in regard to military capability and capacity to deal with crisis management and peacekeeping. We make these decisions of our own volition. Let us not create the idea that we can influence the world by standing out on our own. We influence the world by finding common values with others and promoting the causes and the case we are making for a better, more peaceful world.</p>

Does the Minister see in the future a better way of electing a President of the Commission than the horse trading that has gone on? Would the Minister be open, for example, to the idea that within the confines of the new treaty, the Council and the Presidency would invite the European Parliament to propose names in the first instance so that we would have greater democratic legitimacy than with the spectacle we have had over the past two or three weeks?</p>

          <p eId="para_375">On the last point, the new European constitution takes important steps in that direction. In making its nomination the European Council must take account of the outcome of the European Parliament elections and must consult the Parliament before tabling a name. However, we must also be realistic. We want to be able to attract the best candidates for the job, and people may be more reluctant to consider going for it if the arrangements become too elaborate. We also must ensure that the President of the Commission has the support and confidence of the member states, so we need to strike a balance.</p>

The President was very straightforward and forthcoming in saying that he himself was appalled by what he had seen and what had emerged.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">A number of congressional investigations are ongoing and he said that he will deal with this matter in a transparent way. On the basis of his preparedness to be very clear about his own position and that of his administration in handling it, the Taoiseach mentioned at the press conference that he was satisfied that, having raised the issue, he got answers, undertakings and assurances which confirmed that this matter will be dealt with and those who are guilty will be dealt with in the appropriate way.

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_191">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_386">This year's school building programme of €388 million will deliver in excess of 260 significant school building projects at primary and post-primary level. In excess of 200 of these will commence on site in the current year. The remaining projects had commenced in previous years and are currently nearing completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_387">Apart from the projects included in this year's school building programme, my Department has on hand approximately 950 applications for significant capital investment in the primary and post-primary schools concerned. This figure comprises applications that were assessed over the past two to three years and where an accommodation deficit has been established. It also includes cases that have yet to be assessed by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_388">The Deputy will be aware that I have been concentrating my capital funding on moving to tender and construction those projects already admitted to architectural planning rather than incur new design costs on others. The significant increase in funding secured this year has enabled significant progress to be made and the challenge is to maintain that progress in the coming years and to progress more projects through architectural planning and on to tender and construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_389">I previously announced my intention to publish later this year, for the first time ever, a multiannual programme of works. To that end, the planning and building unit of my Department is currently assessing all remaining projects against the published prioritisation criteria to ensure that the multiannual programme response, when published, is well structured from the outset.</p>
            <p eId="para_390">My aim since taking office has been to give as much information as possible to schools about their status within the building programme. The multiannual programme, when published, will make a further key contribution to that end. Following case by case assessment, it will indicate the status under the prioritisation criteria of all projects. In that way, and having regard to the multiannual funding envelope, my plan is to give indicative timescales for commencement of initial planning, detailed design work or movement to tender and construction as appropriate for particular projects or project bundles.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_192">
            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_391">I thank the Minister for his answer. When the Minister announced the new building programme he changed from his predecessor's stance. He stated it would be open and transparent. If I, Deputy O'Sullivan or any of my colleagues ask a parliamentary question about a school, the general answer given is to look up the website to see the position. From his answer, it appears there are 950 schools which we will not find on the website because they are not on the school building programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_392">The Minister will be aware that I do not normally use examples from my constituency. I visited Emo national school recently. It first applied for an extension for new accommodation 19 years ago and it does not appear on the school building programme. The school has been granted a new teacher and yet has no place to put that teacher. I cannot understand how such a school is not included. Obviously if there are 950 of them, we could come up with plenty of examples like that.</p>
            <p eId="para_393">I welcome what the Minister stated about the multiannual programme of works. It is something I have long called for and supported. How will that impact on the 950 schools? Will the Minister confirm that he will be in a position to at least inform all schools, not just the 260 schools on which he stated that significant progress will be made this year, under the multiannual programme when they are likely to be reached?</p>

            <p eId="para_394">The Deputy will appreciate that with approximately 3,200 primary schools and 700 post-primary schools, it would not be possible for me to keep track of all the schools in the building programme or to answer specific questions on the school to which she referred, but I seem to recall that this was the one the health board closed down because of the sighting of rats in the vicinity of the school.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_396">In the past every school that wrote a letter to the Department seeking inclusion in the building programme was regarded as being on that programme. As a result, the building section of the Department was inundated with telephone calls about projects which were not likely to progress because they did not merit priority in the programme. An ever greater number of schools got on to the building programme and then it became a question of who could shout the loudest or who could assert the most political pressure to get their school completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_397">I have tried to put an end to that. The project applications which had got to some stage of architectural planning form the building programme. We are making substantial progress in moving projects through architectural planning to tender and construction. That will leave space for other schools to advance. The other schools will advance on the basis of clearly set out and objective criteria. That is the only way to operate the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_398">The issue of schools which have particular needs because they get an extra teacher etc. is dealt with, not under the major capital projects in the building programme to which we are referring but separately under temporary accommodation, emergency accommodation or out of the contingency funds, depending on the circumstances involved. When we talk about the school building programme we are referring to the building programme for major projects, both primary and post-primary.</p>

Will the Minister confirm that if a school has made an application, he envisages the Department being in a position to give an indicative timescale or an indication of where the school stands on the list of priorities if it is not yet on the building programme? The biggest frustration is that people have no idea when their school will be reached.</p>

            <p eId="para_400">The biggest frustration for schools was being in the building programme for a good number of years and not getting anywhere. Like other Deputies, I could cite schools in my constituency which were 20 or 25 years allegedly on the building programme but really were not.</p>
            <p eId="para_401">On the schools which have not yet entered the building programme, it is our intention, based on the objective criteria I mentioned, to be in a position to get those schools on to the building programme as others move off it. Not all the 950 have been assessed and therefore at this stage I do not know whether they will be on the building programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_403">Schools which have applied for special needs assistant support will be advised of the outcome of their applications as soon as possible in advance of the next school year. Account is being taken of existing levels of special needs assistant support allocation in schools. In cases where a reduction in the level of special needs assistant support is proposed, there will be provision for schools to appeal, having regard to the care needs of the pupils concerned. Details of the appeals mechanism will be set out in a communication to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_404">Special needs assistants may be approved to support a pupil who has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or other pupils. The criteria used for the assessment of the need for special needs assistant support is outlined in my Department's circular 07/02.</p>
            <p eId="para_405">My Department continues to review the existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. The basic purpose of the review is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs. I am anxious to ensure that special education support services are properly targeted at the children who require them and that the substantially increased resources, which are being made available in the special educational area have the desired effect of ensuring that all children assessed as having special needs receive the support they require.</p>
            <p eId="para_406">Since 1998, the number of special needs assistants in primary schools has grown from about 300 to in excess of 5,500 full-time and part-time assistants.

            <p eId="para_408">Is the Minister aware of the concern in many schools about this issue, given that this circular only arrived in many schools on the last day of term? He stated that action will be taken as soon as possible before the school year but how does he expect schools to deal with this issue before September so they can appoint staff? How can parents decide if they can send their child to the local school when they do not know if there will be a special needs assistant?</p>
            <p eId="para_409">Did the Minister receive the 14 questions from the Irish Primary Principals Network on this issue and will he respond to them? Are primary principals supposed to work through the summer to address these issues while the Department is making its decisions? Will the Minister allow schools to retain part-time special needs assistants and resource teachers next year while the system is changing over? This is very difficult for schools and they are unsure what will happen in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_410">Is the Minister aware of the problems for schools with between 60 and 100 pupils that are losing hours under the circular on resource teachers? I spoke to a resource teacher who works in two schools and her hours have fallen from 17 to ten per week in each of the schools. Will the Minister make things easier for the schools?</p>

            <p eId="para_411">This question deals with special needs assistants and a later question deals with resource teachers. I understand the difficulties schools might have in both cases and I would have liked to have been in a position to have done all of this much earlier. I would have preferred to have both the special educational needs resources and the special needs assistants dealt with but it was complex and time consuming and used up most of the time available to the special education section of the Department, a considerable amount of NEPS time and time of the administrative section of the Department and the inspectorate. All of them worked hard to come up with a system that would be fair to everyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_412">It was not possible to deal with the special needs assistant question at the same time and that is why we are now concentrating on that area. Schools can keep the special needs assistants if they can prove they have a need for them.</p>

     <b>Mr. Crowe </b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
     the new measures he proposes to introduce to reduce pupil-teacher ratios in schools; if his priority and emphasis will be on schools located in officially designated disadvantaged areas; the pupil-teacher ratio he views as an acceptable level; and when schools will receive the necessary resources from his Department to bring about a significant reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_203" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_416">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at both primary and post-primary levels in recent years. The overall pupil teacher ratio at primary level has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.35:1 in the 2003-04 school year. The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 in the 1995-96 school year to 29 in the 2003-04 school year. The staffing schedule for the 2003-04 school year was structured to ensure that all primary schools would operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. It is a matter for school authorities to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_417">The overall pupil teacher ratio at second level has also improved significantly in recent years. The ratio fell from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.48:1 in the 2003-04 school year. I am committed to reducing overall class sizes still further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis having regard to available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_418">With regard to staffing provision for disadvantage at primary level, a range of existing additional supports will continue to be provided in 2004-05. These supports involve the provision of more than 600 teaching posts enabling the implementation of significantly reduced PTRs in both junior and senior classes in more than 240 disadvantaged primary schools. At post-primary level, 203 disadvantaged schools will have more than 220 concessionary teaching posts in 2004-05.</p>
            <p eId="para_419">In addition, I recently approved the allocation of an additional 350 teaching posts for special needs and a new system for the allocation of resources for special needs in primary schools. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special needs, with particular extra provision being made for the most disadvantaged primary schools. I am currently finalising a detailed review of all education disadvantage schemes, with a view to ensuring a fully integrated and cohesive strategy is adopted in this area for the future. I hope to announce the outcome of this review shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_420">All of these measures serve to underline the particular importance I have attached both to tackling educational disadvantage and providing for the needs of children with special needs since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_204">
            <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_421">Unfortunately, many of the schools that have contacted me have a different view, with pupil-teacher ratios rising. The Minister made a commitment to reduce class sizes over a five year period but many schools say they face problems achieving that aim. The Minister specifically committed himself to establishing class sizes of less than 20 for children under nine years of age. Can he give a realistic time frame for achieving that goal?</p>
            <p eId="para_422">While we are talking about disadvantage, young children who come from certain areas are doubly disadvantaged by their background and the size of the classes in their schools. Any of the teachers in those schools will say that individual attention for children with difficulties is of major assistance to those children.</p>
            <p eId="para_423">I have a letter from a school in my constituency that was four pupils short of the number necessary for additional resources last year. For example, there were 15 junior infants in one class and because of a lack of resources there are now 28. There are 31 children in each of the other three classes. There are a number of schools in the same position.</p>
            <p eId="para_424">What commitment does the Minister intend to give in respect of reducing class sizes? Will adequate numbers of teachers emerge from the training system to allow the latter to happen? The OECD figures show that Ireland has one of the highest pupil-teacher ratios in Europe. The Minister has made commitments at conferences etc., but change has not been apparent in the areas to which I refer and the disadvantaged schools within them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_205" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_425">There are 600 plus teaching posts for primary schools in disadvantaged areas. That can be broken down to 312 designated disadvantaged primary schools which will continue to have over 290 concessionary teaching posts. A total of 32 urban primary schools are prioritised for participation in Breaking the Cycle and this will reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in these schools to 15:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes. There are 70 posts involved in this regard. A further 211 urban primary schools that have been prioritised under the Giving Children an Even Break programme will continue to benefit from reduced pupil-teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes. There are approximately 250 posts involved here.</p>
            <p eId="para_426">There are other disadvantaged areas schemes, of which the Deputy will be aware, at primary and post-primary level. I meet, on a reasonably regular basis, primary school principals and at a recent meeting with a number of them in the inner city area I was informed that the average pupil-teacher ratio in some of the schools in this area is as low as 11:1. I will continue to focus as much as possible on disadvantage and on reducing the level of disadvantage suffered by people in the areas to which I refer. I have clearly indicated my priorities, of which disadvantage is one.</p>
            <p eId="para_427">If looking after the disadvantaged means that I cannot reduce the pupil-teacher ratio across the board, particularly in schools in Foxrock and elsewhere, I will continue to cater for the needs of those in disadvantaged areas. I will work towards fulfilling the commitment in the programme for Government regarding reducing the pupil-teacher ratio to 20:1. If this is achievable within the lifetime of the Government, that will be acceptable. Until I know it is achievable, I intend to focus my attention on the areas of which the Deputy is aware. Even though I do not live in such an area, I am aware of their needs.</p>

     <b>Ms Enright</b>
      asked the

     if all outstanding applications for special educational resources will be dealt with before the beginning of the 2004-05 academic year and the current backlog cleared; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_206" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_429">It is my intention that all applications for special educational resources received by 30 June 2004 will be responded to before the commencement of the 2004-05 school year. Applications for resource teacher support that were received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 for which a response is outstanding have been considered and schools have been notified of the outcome. This outcome indicates to schools the resources that may be put in place immediately. Applications received after 31 August 2003 and by 30 June 2004 will be processed in the near future and the outcome will be notified to schools before the commencement of the 2004-05 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_430">The teacher allocations involved will be made in the context of a new weighted system I announced recently. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. The system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs such as, for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability and those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_431">The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all-boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all-girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, it will be one teacher for every 150 pupils; and in all-girls schools, including those with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, it will be one for every 200 pupils. It is intended that the details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_432">The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher incidence special educational needs and this will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in the higher incidence categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_433">My Department proposes to devise clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. The Department will communicate with schools in this regard before the commencement of the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_434">Schools which have applied for special needs assistant support will be advised of the outcome of their applications as soon as possible in advance of the next school year. Account is being taken of existing levels of special needs assistant support allocation in schools. In cases where a reduction in the level of special needs assistant support is proposed, there will be provision for schools to appeal, having regard to the care needs of the pupils concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_435">My Department recognises the difficulties some schools have been experiencing while awaiting the outcome of applications for special educational resources and the introduction of the weighted model. As stated previously, the process has been complex and time-consuming and I am endeavouring to have all aspects completed as quickly as possible. I again acknowledge the co-operation and support of schools in this regard.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_207">
            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_436">The Minister should accept that it was not just schools which suffered. Some children lost an entire year — in some cases even longer — of their education while this matter was being resolved. I hope I misheard him but I was of the impression that the Minister informed Deputy O'Sullivan that he could not deal with the special needs issue because he is dealing with the resource teacher issue. I do not believe we can deal with any of these matters in isolation because they all form part of the same package.</p>
            <p eId="para_437">Approximately 6,000 children in respect of whom applications were made were assessed by psychologists etc. who decided on the number of hours of assistance they required. However, in light of the fact that these children will be dealt with under the new weighted system, will they be provided with the number of hours recommended for them or will some of them have access to fewer hours of assistance?</p>
            <p eId="para_438">I am sure the Minister has been contacted by many teachers. How does he intend to address the concern of those in smaller schools, rural and urban, that they will lose out? I was contacted by a school which will be obliged to deal with a 40% reduction in the number of hours available to it under the new system. I spoke to a principal of a boys' school yesterday which comes under the category where there will be one teacher per 140 pupils. The latter is a significant reduction for disadvantaged schools in terms of the number of hours to which they will have access. How does the Minister envisage the children involved obtaining the assistance they require which, in many instances, was recommended for them? Is he satisfied that there will not be a reduction? Are teachers and principals who state that there will be a reduction wrong? Does the Minister believe that children will receive the service they need if there is a reduction?</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_208" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_439">I am confident the students in the schools will receive the service they require under the new model. That is not to state that every school will have the same level of resources as previously. It is important to make that distinction. We carried out an audit of all schools throughout the country in respect of the resources they possess. There are some which are significantly over-resourced, particularly in terms of the number of special needs pupils enrolled in them. Such schools will obviously not have the same number of special needs teachers or support as was the case heretofore.</p>
            <p eId="para_440">My aim is to ensure that, as regards pupils with special needs, resources will be matched to places where the need is greatest. If the Deputy was referring to a disadvantaged school or a school in a disadvantaged area which was informed that its allocation will be 1:140, a mistake has been made because, as outlined in my initial reply, the ratio in designated disadvantaged areas is one teacher to 80 pupils.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_210" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_442">It could not be less than they are getting at present because the system as it stands would equate to approximately 1:175 or 1:200. It is in that range, though I am not saying it was done that way. A school getting one teacher to 80 pupils will be in a significantly improved situation. Having looked at the audit, there are schools which will win and which will lose in this system, but they will only lose on the basis that they are currently overresourced. Schools which are underresourced will get the full resources to match the number of pupils they have by September 2005, when the weighted model comes fully into play.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_213" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_446">I wish to make clear that the policy of my Department is to provide for the delivery of a broad and balanced physical education curriculum at primary and post-primary levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_447">The position on facilities generally is that many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are utilised for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. Many schools also use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p>
            <p eId="para_448">A particular difficulty has arisen regarding some schools in need of additional accommodation to facilitate extra teacher appointments. In the context of the available funding for temporary accommodation and the number of applications for that funding, in the current year it was not possible to approve all applications received. As an interim measure, therefore, some schools have been advised to maximise the use of existing accommodation until my Department is in a position to make extra accommodation available.</p>
            <p eId="para_449">The need for additional accommodation at any given school will be considered in the context of a review which is being undertaken of all projects that did not proceed as part of the 2004 school building programme with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005, details of which will be announced later in the year.</p>

            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_450">From his answer I presume the Minister is aware that officials in his Department told schools which were denied an extra classroom but which had PE halls that they should use their PE hall as an extra classroom. Is the Minister aware of that? Does he approve of that as a policy? I ask that question in the context of the obligation on schools under the Education Act to teach the curriculum and the inclusion of physical education as part of the curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_451">Is he aware that a recent national study of children aged 11 to 12 showed that 18% of girls and 20% of boys were obese? Is the Minister committed to physical education as a core part of the primary curriculum? Will he reverse the policy of his Department requiring schools, which have PE halls to use those halls as classrooms? That is a move backwards rather than forwards in the provision of physical education in schools.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_215" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_452">I would prefer if schools did not have to use general purpose rooms, rather than PE halls, as classrooms. I do not want that to happen but I am aware that it has occurred and I queried the practice in the Department. On the basis of the amount of money we have for temporary accommodation and the extra teachers we are putting into the system who require extra space, it was not possible to provide the level of temporary accommodation, which was needed and a very difficult decision had to be made. Do we deny temporary accommodation to schools awarded an extra teacher and provide it to schools which have GP rooms or PE halls available to them? We were trying to ensure that the limited amount of money we had was extended to facilitate as many schools as possible. While I regret we had to ask schools to use GP rooms, in the circumstances and given our choices it was the right decision.</p>

            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_453">Will the Minister reconsider this policy? A new PE curriculum will begin next year and I presume the Minister is trying to move towards providing PE for schools. Surely this is a backward step and solving the problem should not take a lot of money. I do not know how many schools are involved, but I have three examples from three different counties and I am sure there are more. Will the Minister look at this again to see if he can come up with the money? We are only talking about providing prefabricated classrooms, presumably, for the schools concerned. I do not see how he can ask teachers to teach PE in a situation where they are being deprived of a facility they have already, particularly when some of these schools have very little outdoor space.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_217" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_454">If I had the money originally to do so that is what I would have done. I am not in favour of what we had to do but we had to do it to stay within our financial limits. Each subhead of the capital building programme, both primary and post-primary, is at a record level this year and is fully committed for the year. It is not possible to move money around or to take it from one area.</p>
            <p eId="para_455">The Deputy is making a serious point and I do not want to minimise it. However, neither do I want to give the impression that this is happening with PE halls all over the country. There are a limited number of schools involved and very few PE halls are taken up in this way. It mostly involves GP rooms. Many primary schools use facilities outside the school for PE, like swimming pools, parks, local GAA pitches and so forth. This is a problem we have had this year and I hope to ensure that next year we have sufficient funding to ensure it does not happen and that the policy can be reversed.</p>

            <p eId="para_457">There is no formal interdepartmental group considering new arrangements for means testing of third level grant applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_458">In accordance with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, I intend to introduce a unified scheme for third level grants. I also propose to put in place a more coherent administration system which will facilitate the introduction of more sophisticated means testing arrangements and ensure consistency of application and client accessibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_459">The Deputy will be aware that the 2003 report entitled Supporting Equity in Higher Education identified the fairness of the means assessment on which student support is based as being a vitally important issue in promoting equity. It noted that the current system is widely regarded as being inequitable and, in line with earlier reports, concluded that the introduction of a capital test would remove a significant perceived inequity in the system. The report also concluded in this context that the administration of the student support schemes needs to be reformed.</p>
            <p eId="para_460">In that context my Department has commenced discussions with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to establish the extent to which they can assist in the streamlining of the administration of the single unified scheme which I intend to establish on a statutory basis to replace existing arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_461">The Deputy will appreciate that there are major implications for the local authorities and vocational education committees in any proposals to change the administration of the maintenance grants schemes. I intend that there will be full consultation with all interested parties and that no irrevocable decisions will be taken on any future arrangements prior to such consultation taking place. In this context my Department has commenced a series of consultations with key stakeholders, including the Irish Vocational Education Association and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, on the future administration of student support schemes. My Department plans to meet other representative groups, including the City and County Managers' Association. When these discussions are concluded, I will be in a position to make a final determination as to the most efficient and effective arrangements for the future administration of the schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_462">The Deputy will be aware that the timeframe for delivering on the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government of June 2002 is the term of office of the Government, which I expect to be until 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_463">I do not know if the Minister can give us a little more information on his proposed timeframe. When does he expect to get a response to the proposals he put to the Department of Social and Family Affairs? What does he foresee as the overall timeframe in terms of producing changes in means testing? In the proposal to include assessment of assets as well as income, does he have any plans on how to assess people's assets?</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_464">The timescale is the lifetime of this Government. I am a little wary of being definitive in regard to timescales given the different bodies and organisations which will be involved in discussions. I cannot be any more precise. There has been a number of meetings with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, including one at ministerial level, and officials have had contacts. There have been at least one or two other meetings of which I am aware, but there has been ongoing contacts between both Departments. Contacts have also been made with the Revenue Commissioners which are more to do with the systems of assessment and so on. They have an expertise in this area which perhaps we would not have. We need to get a grasp of what might and might not be possible in regard to assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">On the question of the method we might use for assessing assets and so on, no work has been done in that area. There is a number of reports, as the Deputy knows. The issue arises a little in the context of the discussions with the Department of Social and Family Affairs which has a method for assessing capital and the value of capital for social welfare payments. That is one area that will be discussed by the two Departments.</p>

     <b>Mr. McGinley </b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
     if he will consider giving students who, due to illness, family bereavement or other such genuine reason miss sitting for a subject or subjects in their leaving certificate examinations, the opportunity of taking the subjects missed during the same academic year thus avoiding another full year at second level.
     [19470/04]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_221" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_467">On foot of a Government decision, I formally established the State Examinations Commission on 6 March 2003. The commission now has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_468">Within the limitations of our examination system, every possible effort is made by the commission to accommodate candidates who suffer illness, bereavement or other trauma immediately before or during the examinations. Each year, arrangements are made to cater for a wide range of emergencies. These include alterations to the standard examination timetable and special sittings in venues such as hospitals. The National Educational Psychological Service also assists schools and students in crisis during examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">The leaving certificate is mainly a terminal examination, which is examined by external examiners. This contrasts with examination systems in many other countries where assessment is conducted on a continuous basis or is conducted by the student's own teachers. Where the processes include a significant element of school-based assessment of students, the models provide a template within which there is the data, capacity and flexibility to deal with students who, for genuine reasons beyond their control, are unable to complete the written element of their examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_470">Prior to the establishment of the commission, the Department of Education and Science gave the issue of a repeat leaving certificate consideration over the years because it was raised regularly. The Department concluded that the constraints inherent in a terminal and externally examined examination system, resulted in significant difficulties in regard to the provision of repeat examinations. These constraints derive from: the length of the school year; the timescale required for holding examinations; obtaining sufficient additional suitably qualified persons to act as examiners; providing adequate time for the preparation of marking schemes for the repeat exam papers and arranging for comprehensive briefing and training of examiners; providing ample time for those examiners to conduct the marking to a high standard; the pressing requirement of having results available to feed into the college entry process which is conducted by the CAO and college admissions departments in August each year; and the need for an appeal system for the review of repeat results.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_472">When one considers that our State examinations currently operate against the tightest of timescales and to maximum capacity in delivering a high quality product at both leaving and junior certificate levels to strict end-users deadlines, it is considered that it would not be possible to hold repeat examinations and have results available to the deadlines required.</p>
            <p eId="para_473">However, the future direction of senior cycle education in Ireland is currently under review, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has published proposals which outline a vision for the type of school system which might exist by 2010. The proposals envisage restructuring of overall senior cycle programmes and subjects into subjects, units and short courses, and provider for an increased emphasis on modes of flexible practical-portfolio-project and continuous assessment, with assessment events spread out across courses of study and available more frequently. Depending on the models finally adopted, this may help reduce the importance of a student's performance in terminal examinations in the future and will enable the issue of repeat examinations to be reconsidered.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_222">
            <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_474">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Being a former teacher and a parent, I know the Minister understands the importance of the leaving certificate to pupils because the results of the leaving certificate often determine the future academic career of pupils. At third level, there are opportunities to sit repeat examinations. I, and I am sure the Minister and my colleagues, know of academically gifted pupils who for some reason or other — perhaps injury, illness or family bereavement — miss an exam or two. That they cannot repeat that exam within the academic year means they must spend another year in the secondary school cycle which throws everything back a year. I know the State Examinations Commission has the ultimate responsibility but I ask the Minister if he will look favourably on it considering the feasibility of providing an opportunity of holding a repeat exam at a central location, such as Athlone or Dublin, for pupils who miss out on an examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_475">I remember when I did my exams, as I am sure does the Minister and perhaps my colleagues — I do not know about Deputy Enright — there was the matriculation. If one failed or did not turn up for one of the leaving certificate examinations, one had the safety net of the matriculation in the mainstream subjects. That safety net is no longer there. Pupils in other jurisdictions probably have the opportunity to repeat, which is important.</p>
            <p eId="para_476">Each year a certain percentage of pupils miss out. The exam could be held in a central location. There are bound to be back-up papers. There must be a bank of questions. If a paper is inadvertently given out, there is certainly a back-up one. It is not impossible if the will is there to do it. Will the Minister contact the State Examinations Commission and ask it to look seriously at the feasibility of providing this facility? It would mean so much to so many pupils who spend two years preparing assiduously for the leaving certificate and, through no fault of their own, miss an exam or two.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_223" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_477">I do not disagree with the Deputy in regard to the trauma involved if something happens. I had experience of it in this year's leaving certificate in the case of two young people I knew. One young person's mother died on the morning of an examination but the State Examination Commission carried on the fine tradition of the Department in trying to facilitate the individual. The girl was brave enough to go ahead and sit the exam, although I realise she may not do as well in her exam as perhaps she would under normal circumstances. I have outlined a host of reasons this proposal was rejected previously. It is fair to say that as long as we continue to have a leaving certificate examination as is, those reasons will not change, principally, although not least, because of the CAO system we operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_478">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is carrying out a review of the leaving certificate and will put forward various suggestions in that regard. One of the benefits of a change in the leaving certificate would be that it would allow prior assessments and judgments on a person's abilities rather than as at present where one is totally dependent on a terminal exam. In the context of the NCCA report — I hope to have the initial part of that report soon, although I will have the full report by the end of the year — I will undertake to look at this question again in light of the case the Deputy made.</p>

            <p eId="para_479">I thank the Minister. Without being patronising, he has been innovative in several areas. Many opportunities are provided for students to sit their leaving certificate examination, including in hospital beds and so on. This would be one final step towards completing the circle.</p>

      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
     if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science at the lack of co-ordination in the provision of pre-school education in view of the large number of Departments involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_482">Responsibilities for early childhood education and care are divided among a number of Departments and agencies. My Department has responsibilities in the education area and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibilities concerning child care. In addition, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and agencies such as National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education and the National Children's Office also have major roles in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_483">In 1999, my Department published the White Paper on early childhood education, entitled Ready to Learn, which recommended greater liaison between the Departments and agencies involved. My Department also commissioned the education directorate of the OECD to review early childhood education and care in Ireland. The review, which is to be published soon, makes similar recommendations in regard to co-ordination issues in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_484">Recognising that responsibility for early childhood education and care is dispersed across many Departments and agencies, the Government established the Cabinet committee on children. To consider co-ordination issues in the child care and early education area, the Cabinet committee established an interdepartmental high level working group on child care and early childhood education in June 2003. This group, which is being chaired by the National Children's Office, is also considering the issues raised by the OECD report. The issues raised by the Deputy will be considered in light of the recommendations of the high level working group.</p>

            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_485">The Minister often refers to the fact that disadvantage is his main priority. Does he agree that early intervention is vital in giving children an opportunity to participate on an equal basis, thus preventing disadvantage at a later stage? Will the Minister give priority to this matter? So many of the Minister's answers and those of his colleagues refer to reports, studies and interdepartmental groups but we really need action.</p>
            <p eId="para_486">The Joint Committee on Education and Science recently heard a number of presentations in this regard. The Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, to which the Minister referred, identified nine different Departments as having a role in the provision of early childhood education. The provision of such education is patchy, short-term and, in some cases, dependent on community employment workers who come and go. Will the Minister give some priority to this area? In comparison with other countries, does the Minister agree that Ireland is very low on the scale in providing early childhood education?</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_228" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">

            <p eId="para_487">On the Deputy's last point, we are not that low on the scale in many respects. In most other European countries, the primary school starting age is six, whereas here it is four. Almost 50% of our four year olds are in school at that stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_489">Not necessarily, but my point is valid and worth remembering. I can get the figures for the Deputy. I accept her main point, however, that early intervention, particularly in disadvantaged areas, is essential. As soon as this report has been completed and comes to my attention, I will act on it. I do not know what will be recommended in the end, but integration and co-ordination are needed. I have already established the Centre for Early Childhood Education and Development. I have asked the National Council on Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, to work on the education curriculum for pre-school children, and that work is already under way. I agree with the Deputy on that matter. My priority in that area will not be to introduce pre-school education for every child in the State because we would end up doing only half the job. The priority will be for disadvantaged areas, from where it can spread out. The Deputy's essential point about the necessity for early intervention is well documented. I agree fully with her that it is necessary to move early on it.</p>

     the legislative changes sought by the investigation committee of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse; if it is intended to agree to the amendments sought; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_233" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_493">Following the appointment of Mr. Justice Seán Ryan as chairperson designate of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Government requested that he carry out his own independent review of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. This report, together with a review of the operation of the commission carried out by the Attorney General, were published on 15 January 2004. The Government has accepted the recommendations in Justice Ryan's report for legislative amendments to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000. My Department is in ongoing contact with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in connection with this matter and work on drafting legislation to amend the Act is at an advanced stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">Amendments envisaged in Judge Ryan's report that will be made to the legislation include the removal of the obligation on the committee to hear each allegation of abuse made to it, a provision to allow for joint hearings to take place, provision for single member division of a committee, and the right of a complainant to withdraw a complaint subject to the consent of the committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">Since the publication of Judge Ryan's report, the commission has been engaged in a consultation process with all relevant parties to facilitate them in expressing their views on the content of both reports and to enable them to make suggestions on the future operation of the investigation committee of the commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">This process has now been concluded and, in a statement issued by Judge Ryan on 16 June 2004, the commission decided to proceed in accordance with a position paper that it published on 7 May. This means that the investigation committee now proposes that individual perpetrators of abuse will not be named by it unless they were convicted in the courts and that it will call witnesses to give evidence of abuse suffered by them to the extent necessary for the inquiry. The statement of 16 June and the earlier position paper from the investigation committee are available from the commission's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_497">Arising from the above, I understand that the commission is in the process of finalising its requests for further legislative changes and that it will write to the Government with those changes in the near future. I will bring any such requests for additional changes to the legislation to Government for consideration as a matter of urgency upon receipt of the request from the commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">While work on the amending legislation is at an advanced stage, it is not possible to publish any of the amending legislation in advance of any additional requests for changes being received. However, I understand that a further potential difficulty regarding the publication of amending legislation is in the process of being resolved in that the Christian Brothers have indicated that they will not be proceeding with the Supreme Court challenge to the commission that was scheduled for 29 and 30 of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_499">At this stage, it is envisaged that amending legislation will be published in advance of the Dáil term in the autumn. However, the commission has indicated that it intends to proceed with its hearings in advance of any amending legislation being enacted and I fully support it in this approach.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_500">One of the reasons for delaying amending legislation was the Christian Brothers case which was expected to be heard at this time. I presume the information is correct that they are not going to proceed with the case. Does the Minister see any other obstacles to proceeding with the legislation? Does he expect to publish it before the next Dáil term and, if not, perhaps he can indicate to the House the timing involved?</p>
            <p eId="para_501">The Minister said originally that he would not favour what was described as "sampling", whereby only certain cases were to be heard by the commission. Has he had discussions with the various groups representing survivors of child abuse about this issue? If the Minister feels that a person wants to give evidence to the commission, he or she should be allowed to do so. In his reply, the Minister referred to a number of people sitting on the commission for the hearings. Will parallel hearings be held in order that different elements of the work of the commission can be carried out at the same time by different people? As well as the issue of time scale, this was one of the issues raised by Ms Justice Laffoy when she originally expressed concern at the lack of support from the Department of Education and Science.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_235" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_502">The question of provision for a single member division of the committee was raised in Mr. Justice Ryan's report and the Department will make provision for it. However, if I recall correctly, the judge did not favour that approach even though he felt it would be a good idea to have provision for it in the legislation because he foresaw difficulties with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">The judge has been consulting all the relevant parties in regard to the sampling issue for the past week or ten days, for which I commend him. He has listened to all the groups and is making his own decisions in this regard. Soon after the judge's appointment, the survivors' groups asked me to ask him to write to each victim who had applied to see if he or she wanted to continue his or her hearing. I note from newspaper reports in the past two or three days that he has done just that. In that context, the dialogue should continue between the commission and the survivors' groups through the open public hearings because it is the best way forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">I do not want to interfere in the work of the commission itself. Obviously, there was a difficulty when Ms Justice Laffoy resigned and I met the groups at that stage to try to assure them that the Government wanted a conclusion to the inquiries and so on. There are also ongoing contacts between officials in my Department and the groups in regard to a variety of matters. However, it is better for matters relating directly to the commission to be dealt with by it and the survivors' groups to agree a process.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">In my original reply, I indicated that, subject to what Mr. Justice Ryan reports, I hope the legislation will be published before the Dáil resumes for the autumn session. This is subject to the proviso that the judge might, as a result of the work before him, throw up a recommendation which could cause a difficulty.</p>

            <p eId="para_507">My Department's gender equality unit, as part of its remit, supports research on the nine grounds of equality as delineated in the Equal Status Act 2000. The research work referred to by the Deputy is one such project. It is being conducted by Fr. James Norman of the Mater Dei Institute and involves an attitudinal survey of teachers of social, personal and health education, SPHE, at second level. The research is intended to establish the experience of teachers in both single-sex and co-educational schools in dealing with the issues of HIV-AIDS education, sexuality education and homophobia as part of the SPHE programme. The survey is expected to be completed in autumn 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">Following from the survey results, it is anticipated that a second phase of the project will involve initiating an action research project. In the action research project a small number of schools will be invited to participate in a pilot project to develop resources to address the issue of homophobia among pupils. It is expected that the second phase of the project will be completed by the end of 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_509">I welcome the survey because we cannot do anything if we do not have the correct information with which to work and I welcome the Minister's reply in that regard. When the survey is complete and the results have been published, the Minister referred to a pilot project being initiated. In this context, has the Minister changed his mind on implementing a national school bullying programme?</p>
            <p eId="para_510">It is nearly a year and a half since two groups appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science, one from Trinity College Dublin and the other from a pilot project which was conducted in County Donegal to examine bullying. Those groups' statistics on what they had achieved in comparison to other areas, in which bullying programmes are hit and miss, show what can be done if a proper programme is in place. In this context, will the Minister reconsider his response to me last year and will he consider implementing a national school bullying programme using this research and other factors?</p>

            <p eId="para_511">The groups to which the Deputy referred are not the only ones which have done work on bullying in schools. The Deputy may be aware of another in the North Eastern Health Board area. I do not know if the Department can add much more to what is already in place.

However, such cases have not been brought to my attention. I accept that some schools may implement the policies better and place greater priority on them than others. I acknowledge the Deputy has a particular interest in this issue and I will raise the matter internally in the Department to see what information we have on how well the schools anti-bullying programmes are being implemented. I will revert to the Deputy at that stage if I feel there is a need to reiterate the policy.</p>

      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
     when he proposes to reach the target of 90% pre-school participation by 2010 contained in the Barcelona agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
     [19473/04]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_241" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_515">The Barcelona conclusions of the European Council of 16 and 17 March 2002 state that member states should remove disincentives to the female labour force and strive, in line with national patterns of provision, to provide child care by 2010 to at least 90% of children between three years and mandatory school age and at least 33% of children under three years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_516">The Department of Education and Science is responsible for the education of children. To date, 49% of all four year olds and virtually all five year olds are enrolled in infant classes in primary schools. Children can commence their primary school education provided they have reached the age of four years on 1 September of the academic year in question while compulsory education starts at six years.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">My Department has traditionally been engaged in the formal education of children aged four years but is now committed to the education of children from birth to six years and through its agencies is setting down the education framework required for early years education. The centre for early childhood development and education is currently preparing the groundwork for this and has recently published a draft discussion document on a conceptual quality framework describing how children from birth to six years develop and learn. The draft discussion document also identifies appropriate learning goals and objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">In addition, the NCCA has just published a consultative document entitled Towards a Framework for Early Learning, which focuses specifically on learning throughout early childhood from birth to six years. Early childhood is a new area for the NCCA and to assist it in its work it has established a working group on early childhood education. The consultative document was developed as a basis for working in partnership with the early childhood sector to develop a framework to support children's learning throughout the early childhood period from birth to six years. The NCCA is in the midst of a consultative process to obtain the views of practitioners in the early childhood sector before the document is finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">My Department is this year providing €8 million for early education initiatives such as the early start pilot project, the Rutland Street project, pre-schools for Travellers and the work of the centre for early childhood development and education. However, in terms of the Barcelona declaration, it is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has responsibility for child care provision to support parents in employment, education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">The issue of reaching the Barcelona targets is of great concern to the Government and in order to consider issues in the child care and early education arena, the Cabinet Committee on Children established an interdepartmental high-level working group on child care and early childhood education in June 2003. This interdepartmental working group, which is being chaired by the National Children's Office, is expected to report before the end of the current year.</p>

            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_521">We have dealt with this already to some extent. Is the Minister concerned that the provision of early childhood facilities in disadvantaged areas is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather than the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Health and Children, because it is considered to be an inequality measure for parents rather than a child focused measure? In that regard, does he consider he has a role in terms of children who do not always get the opportunity for pre-school even though they live in disadvantaged areas, because the focus is on the parents rather than on the children?</p>
            <p eId="para_522">The Minister has said he was working on reviewing all the various measures on educational disadvantage. Will he indicate the time scale within which he expects to reach conclusions and when he might be in a position to expand early start or to provide whatever he decides is appropriate, as a result of his investigations? We hear much about disadvantage but so far there has been little action because of this review.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_243" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_523">Just because we are talking about disadvantage and reviewing it, does not mean every scheme in place is suspended or the money withdrawn. We are still spending at least €0.5 billion on various schemes on disadvantage. I want to ensure we are getting the best value possible and that those who are disadvantaged are getting that good value. I would not like anybody to get the impression that every scheme is suspended and that the €0.5 billion being spent on that area is going elsewhere. It is not and spending in that area has increased significantly in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">I am not concerned that the provision of child care facilities is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than the Department of Health and Children. I would be more concerned if such responsibility did not rest with some Department. The question as to whether that is the most appropriate place for it is one that is worthy of consideration. I am not making a political point when I say it may have been the party of which the Deputy is a Member that created the equality portfolio which helped it to drift into that area.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_244">
            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_525">That is probably true.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_245" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_526">There has been a traditional reluctance in the Department of Education and Science to look at education for the age group from 0-4 because it has a grave fear of being lumbered with the education of children from 0-4 and not getting the money that, perhaps, other agencies get to provide the service. The time for that is gone. The focus should be on the child and what is best for the child. In the area of education and the development of children and so on it is the Department of Education and Science that should take responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">I should say, not because the Minister in question is coming into the House, the work that has been done by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to the provision of child care facilities deserves to be commended. There are some officials there, such as Sylda Langford, who are top class and who have probably got rid of much of the bureaucracy that may have enfolded these schemes in other departments. While it is not the most appropriate place for it, that Department has done a fantastic job in that area. The Department of Health and Children should assume greater responsibility for it.</p>

        <heading>Civil Liability and Courts Bill 2004 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_531">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I welcome the opportunity to bring the Civil Liability and Courts Bill 2004 before this House following its passage through Seanad Éireann. The Bill was generally well received in the Seanad. The debate was constructive and helpful and, arising from the debate, a number of amendments have been made to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The Bill implements certain commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government, including relevant recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, and changes the law on civil liability in some other respects. By introducing new penalties for fraudulent and exaggerated claims it tackles the so-called "compensation culture". The Bill also provides for major procedural changes in relation to personal injury actions to reduce the time taken and the costs involved in processing such actions. In addition, the Bill amends the <i>in camera</i> rule, provides for the disposal of part of the funds of suitors and makes provision in relation to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in proceedings relating to land, consequent on the ending of the rateable valuation system.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The Bill complements the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, which was sponsored by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. The PIAB was established to address the situation where liability is not an issue. The measures contained in this Bill are aimed at cases where legal action is instituted in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I am convinced that this Bill, when in force, will help to alleviate the insurance burden on customers and business and the cost to public authorities of personal injury actions. It can do this without compromising the right of persons injured through the wrongful act of another to be compensated for their loss. Substantial progress has been made on personal injuries premiums which are moving in the right direction. Employers' liability premiums and public liability premiums are also moving in the right direction. Nothing can be taken for granted. Increased competition in the insurance area coupled with the raft of measures taken by the Government, on foot of the commitments in the programme for Government, have produced results. Those results must be sustained and the reforms involved must be driven home and made permanent, not just as some passing phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">In regard to civil liability, this country faces serious competition as a location for economic activity. One of the chief negatives in Ireland is the civil liability culture, which is probably one of the most "generous" schemes in Europe. This is funded by an insurance premium underpinning which is probably one of the most penal on enterprise and on ordinary citizens in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">As in the Seanad, I look forward to the views which will be expressed in today's debate and I will be as accommodating as I can be in that regard. I turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Part 2 deals with civil liability and provides for procedural and other changes in actions to recover damages for personal injuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Section 6 amends the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 1991 by reducing the limitation period for personal injuries actions from three to two years to ensure that claims are brought forward in a timely fashion. Members will recall that the Bill as published proposed to reduce the limitation period to one year. This provision was discussed in detail in the Seanad where it was argued that the proposed one year period was too short, particularly in cases of medical negligence. From my own experience in the legal profession, I can appreciate the problems which can arise in such cases and, having regard to the views expressed in the Seanad and elsewhere, have agreed to set the limitation period at two years. There is an emphasis in Part 2 on the provision of full information on the claim being made. The reduction from three to two years is made in the context of the obligation to send the initial warning letter, which is an innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">At the end of the two year period, it will not suffice to issue a general plenary summons with a general endorsement of claim saying the plaintiff's claim is for damages for negligence. At the end of the period, a pleading will have to be served which rolls up the original summons and statement of claim in civil procedure. The plaintiff will have to state in his or her first court document the entirety of the claim as known to him or her. That is another time constraint which must be taken into account in the context of adopting or changing the Statute of Limitations. As people involved in civil litigation will remember, it was very easy simply to stop the clock with a plenary summons. It will not be possible to stop the clock with a three-line summons from now on, rather it will be necessary to set out <i>in extenso</i> what a claim is all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Section 7 provides that where a plaintiff fails to serve a notice on the defendant within two months of the date of an accident or the date of knowledge, he or she may be — not necessarily must be — penalised in costs. Furthermore, the court may, not must, draw such inferences from the failure as appear appropriate. Under the section, there is a general duty to notify and warn the other side that a claim is in prospect, particularly in cases in which solicitors are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In many cases, time limits set down by rules of court are not adhered to which causes delays in the progress of actions. This has been the subject of some criticism at European Court of Human Rights level. Therefore, section 8 makes it a function of the court to ensure positively that parties to a personal injuries action comply with rules of court. Extensions to time limits will only be allowed where both parties agree or where they are necessary to enable an action to be properly prosecuted or defended or where the interests of justice require an extension. An extension will not simply be available as a matter of course to a party from now on. The culture must change in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">It is a common complaint of our current personal injuries system that defendants are often unaware of the details of a claim until late in proceedings. Sections 9 to 12, inclusive, seek to remedy this difficulty. Section 9 provides that a personal injuries action shall be brought by means of a personal injuries summons and outlines the information which must be contained in such a summons. This information includes particulars of all items of special damages claimed, the wrongful acts of the defendant, the circumstances of the wrong and each instance of negligence. In many cases, further information may be required from the plaintiff by the defendant. Section 10 deals with this issue by listing items of information which may be requested and, as a result, must be supplied. Where a claim is made for earnings or other income, the plaintiff is required on request to furnish documents from the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Provision is also made to give the courts power to deal with non-compliance with a request under the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The need for full information applies also to defences and counterclaims. In section 11, it is provided that a defence must specify those elements of the claim for which the defendant does or does not require proof. The defence must also contain a statement outlining the grounds on which a defendant claims he or she is not liable for any injuries to the plaintiff. In respect of counterclaims, the section lists those elements which must be included. In essence, a counterclaim must contain all the information required in a personal injuries summons as outlined in section 9. The intention with this section is to ensure that a plaintiff is fully apprised of the details. Section 12 requires that all pleadings contain full and detailed particulars and that such pleadings must be lodged in the relevant court. Deputies will note that I introduced an amendment to this section in the Seanad which provides that all pleadings shall be in a form prescribed by rules of court.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">A key element of the Bill is contained in section 13 which is designed to combat false and exaggerated personal injury claims. Under the section, parties to a personal injury action must swear an affidavit verifying the contents of any pleading or further information requested under section 10. I have made a minor amendment to section 13(4)(<i>a</i>). Whereas the Bill originally required that a verifying affidavit be lodged in court not later than seven days after the service of a pleading, this period has now been changed to 21 days. I took this action in response to amendments tabled by Opposition Senators and other views which were expressed to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Section 13(5) makes it an offence to make a statement in an affidavit which is false or misleading and which the person knows to be false and misleading. As Deputies will see, this is a serious criminal offence which attracts a ten-year penalty. The offence is not prosecutable summarily except where the District Court accepts jurisdiction. A further aspect of this provision — as outlined in section 13(8) — is that the section applies not only to actions brought following its commencement but also to actions pending at that time where one party requires another to swear a verifying affidavit. Consequently, the reform will become operative from a very early date once the provision is in force.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Section 14 provides that a court may direct the parties to a personal injuries action to meet in a mediation conference to discuss and attempt to settle a case. A chairman of the conference may be agreed by the parties or, in the absence of such agreement, appointed by the court. It is vital in mediation that the confidentiality of all parties is respected. To ensure this is the case, section 14 provides that the notes of a chairperson of a mediation conference and all communications during it shall be confidential and cannot be used in evidence in any subsequent civil or criminal proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Section 15 provides that, if necessary, the chairman of a mediation conference must prepare and submit to the court a report of the conference. I introduced an amendment to this section in response to points made by Senators which will ensure that any report shall also be provided to the parties involved in the action. The report shall outline whether the conference took place, what issues, if any, were agreed and, where an agreement has been reached, contain a copy of the settlement terms signed by all parties. In cases where a party has failed to comply with a direction of the court under section 14 to participate in a conference, the court may direct that party to pay costs incurred after the direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">My intention in introducing section 16 is to put in place a system whereby parties state their terms of settlement before a case proceeds to trial. The section requires the plaintiff and defendant in a personal injuries action to serve a notice of offer of settlement on the other party. It remains open to a defendant to state that he or she wishes to offer a nil amount by way of settlement. Such offers of settlement will remain open for a period to be prescribed by regulations. While a judge hearing a case will be aware that offers of settlement have been made, he or she will not be aware of the terms of such offers until after a judgment has been delivered in the action. The court shall, however, have regard to the offers and the conduct of the parties in making the final offers when considering the costs of an action.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The reasonableness or unreasonableness of the behaviour of the parties will be directly reflected in the decision on costs at the conclusion of a case if that becomes relevant. People who play hardball, ham up claims or behave unreasonably and force another party to defend a claim will find themselves in danger of being seriously penalised on costs. That will have the positive effect as members of the legal profession find there is a serious risk to their own interest in a case, which is usually costs, if they play hardball or behave unreasonably.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">In section 17, the concept of pre-trial hearings is introduced. A pre-trial hearing is intended to determine what matters, are in dispute and require to be decided at a trial. In section 18, provision is made for a court to direct that evidence may be given by way of affidavit. In many personal injuries actions conflicting evidence from experts must be decided on by the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Section 19 allows a court to appoint approved persons to investigate and give expert evidence on any issue the court may direct. The section provides also that any party to a personal injuries action shall co-operate with an approved person. The provision is intended to allow the court to appoint to assist it an expert independent of any expert witness retained by the parties. If it must be decided whether somebody is or is not suffering from chronic back pain, it will be open to the court to appoint a medical practitioner with expertise in that area to prepare an independent view. The justice provided will not simply be adversarial as the court itself will have its own independent view of the matter. While the expert testifying in those circumstances will be liable to cross-examination, the provision will lead to a less adversarial system of expert testimony than currently exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Section 20 is an important provision dealing with intervention in a personal injuries action. It provides that where an appeal is taken to the Supreme Court, the court may, where it considers that any matter in the case is of exceptional public importance and the action is one of a class of claims in which the same or similar matters arise, invite appropriate persons to make submissions to it. Such an intervention may come about at the initiative of the court, at the request of any party or of any person who is not a party. An issue may arise in a series of cases which is of exceptional public importance and goes beyond the interests of the parties before the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">This could, for example occur within the ambit of nervous shock. If, for example, when walking down a street I witness a collision between two people causing fatal injury to one of them and I suffer shock and injury on account of what I have witnessed, the ambit of that right to claim damages has serious implications. Recently, for example, we had a case where somebody working in a hospital accident and emergency unit or a morgue claimed damages after suffering nervous shock arising from a traffic accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">This gives rise to the question of reasonable foreseeability and proximity. This is not just a matter of a good or bad barrister spending an afternoon in court arguing the toss between a plaintiff or a defendant and coming to a conclusion on this issue. The Attorney General or others may want to tell the Supreme Court that such a High Court decision extends the concept of reasonable foreseeability or proximity too far and will have general repercussions if it becomes a general application.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Section 21 provides that a court should have regard to the book of quantum produced by the Personal Injuries Assessment Bureau when assessing damages in a personal injuries action. Subsection (2) provides that this shall not operate to prohibit a court from having regard to matters other than the book of quantum when determining damages. This is an effort to bring some degree of joined-up thinking to the issue so the book of quantum will not be a document that gets discarded or left behind. It will be a document relevant to court cases and must, therefore, be maintained in a condition suitably relevant to them and PIAB proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Section 22 deals with the issue of actuarial tables. The section provides that the Minister may prescribe actuarial tables for the purpose of assessing damages for future financial loss in personal injuries actions. The court is required under subsection (2) to refer to such tables in making its assessment of damages. Subsection (3) provides for the designation of a person to prepare such tables.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Section 23 will enable the Minister to fix by regulation the rate to be used by the court to discount future losses to their present value. By doing this, I hope to obviate the need to call expert actuarial or economist evidence in cases where there would be disagreement between the parties as to what the discount rate should be. This would have the effect of creating greater certainty on the subject and of reducing costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">An essential element of the Bill is the necessity to reduce the number of false and bogus claims for personal injuries. Sections 24 and 25 seek to tackle this issue. Section 24 deals with the issue of false evidence. It makes it an offence to give, adduce or dishonestly cause to be given or adduced evidence that is false or misleading and which a person knows to be false or misleading. Equally, it shall be an offence to give, adduce or dishonestly cause to be given or adduced false information to a solicitor or expert on the other side for the purpose of codding them as to the nature of a case. Section 24(4) provides that this section applies to personal injuries actions pending at its commencement as well as to subsequent actions. It cannot, however, be retrospective in its effect. That an action has commenced before the Act comes into operation does not mean there will be a free pass with regard to such falsity.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Many Deputies share my concern that, in some cases, persons have misled the courts on aspects of their claim and yet have walked away with a substantial award in their favour. This is unacceptable. Section 25 will deal with this situation. It provides that, where a plaintiff in a personal injuries action gives, adduces or dishonestly causes to be given or adduced evidence that is false or misleading and which the plaintiff knows is false or misleading, the court shall dismiss the plaintiff's action unless this would result in injustice being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">This creates two conditions. From now on, if people tell lies in support of their claim for personal injury, they risk losing everything. This also gives defendants an incentive to examine cases carefully because, if they detect dishonesty on the plaintiff's side, the case can be dismissed in its entirety. This provision is not made to provide a bonus to insurance companies but to deter fraudulent cases. People must understand that if they take personal injuries actions, they will lose out if they come other than with clean hands as genuine claimants. If they come with dishonest intent either to exaggerate or tell lies about their case, they will get nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">If, for example, a plaintiff states that as a result of fracturing his or her leg he or she can no longer play golf and subsequently a video is shown to the court of the person playing golf, the person will not only not get the extra damages he or she would have got as a result of not being able to play golf but will also lose the full damages and the case will be thrown out of court emphatically. Costs will also be charged.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Section 26 deals with the issue of collateral benefits. The Civil Liability Act 1961 and the amending legislation of 1964 are amended by providing for the deductibility of charitable donations made by the defendant if he or she specifies in advance that the donation is being made on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Section 27 provides that any income, in respect of which a claim is being made but which has not been returned or notified to the Revenue Commissioners will be disregarded by the court in assessing damages save for situations where the court considers that an injustice would be done. Therefore, compensation cannot be made for black market income.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I already mentioned offences committed under this Part of the Bill. Such offences are serious. Section 28 provides that, if convicted on indictment for an offence, a person shall be liable for a penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or a fine not exceeding €100,000, or both. A summary conviction, which is not available as of right, carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison or a fine of up to €3,000, or both.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Section 29 provides that the Courts Service shall set up and maintain a register of personal injuries actions, which shall contain the name, address and occupation of the parties to personal injuries actions. The register shall be published on the Internet and in any other form the Courts Service considers appropriate. This will make it clear that a person cannot be a multiple claimant and hope to get away with it if there is any dishonesty involved. A person cannot keep falling over potholes in a variety of different local authority areas and hope the fact of the various claims remains secret. Claiming records will be noted and available.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Section 30 will remedy what might be regarded as a deficiency in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act as passed in the Oireachtas towards the end of last year. Section 54(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Act provides that one of the principal functions of the PIAB is to cause a cost-benefit analysis to be made of the legal procedures and the associated processes employed in the State for the purpose of awarding compensation for personal injuries. While Section 54(2) provides that the board shall have all such powers as are necessary or expedient for, or incidental to, the performance of its functions under the Act, it is considered opportune to provide a specific power to the PIAB to require any person, including a Minister or a body established by or under any enactment, to provide it with any information it may reasonably require for the purposes of the performance of this particular function under section 54(1)(<i>c</i>). Subsection (2) imposes a duty to comply with a requirement of the PIAB in this respect. This means that the PIAB can seek a court order against any non-compliant person or body.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Part 3 of the Bill provides for the realisation of the dormant funds of suitors of the High Court, and of the special account for small balances in the High Court and their transfer to the Exchequer for the benefit of projects of the Courts Service. Dormant funds of suitors of the High Court result mainly from unclaimed funds of wards of court, funds invested on behalf of minors, tail balances, bail deposits, civil lodgements as well as amounts of interest accruing on capital sums lodged in court and subsequently paid out. Funds become dormant when there has been no activity over the preceding 15 years, with the exception of small balances which are deemed to be dormant after five years. Periodic efforts made by the Courts Service to refund dormant funds to account holders have met with limited success.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">There have been four previous Funds of Suitors Acts, in 1959, 1963, 1966 and 1984. Those Acts allocated the dormant funds to certain social, cultural and court rehabilitation projects such as the Cork Opera House, the Abbey Theatre, the Peacock Theatre, The King's Inns and the Children's Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">When I originally introduced this Bill in the Seanad, the then estimated value of the dormant funds was €6.4 million. However, the Courts Service had not at that stage completed its full examination of such accounts and in the interim certain amounts became dormant. Several of these were unusually large. I am now informed by the Courts Service that the value of the dormant funds is currently estimated at €9.4 million. The critical point on this occasion is that the funds transferred will be used now and in the future for purposes in regard to the defrayal of costs involved in the provision, management and maintenance of court buildings, as provided for in the relevant section of the Courts Service Act 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Following further consultation with the Courts Service, the Department of Finance and the parliamentary counsel, I intend to introduce on Committee Stage certain necessary and primarily technical and procedural clarifications and additions to this part of the Bill by way of amendments. In particular, having noted comments in the Seanad, it is my intention to provide for a public notification procedure of the transfer of the funds and also to provide for the creation of a proper registration system for the dormant funds. These matters did not feature in any previous funds of suitors legislation, but I believe they are now necessary to assist and inform any persons who might have a claim on the dormant funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Chapter 2 of Part 3 deals with miscellaneous court provisions. Among the court provisions included in this chapter are the amendment of the <i>in camera</i> rule and provisions regarding the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in proceedings relating to land. Section 36 amends the <i>in camera</i> rule, particularly as it relates to various family law statutes. This was the subject of much discussion in the Seanad. I am not happy with the current construction of the section and will table an amendment on Committee Stage to remedy the apparent deficiencies in the section as drafted. As currently drafted, I am concerned that the section could expose people to the fear at any rate, if not the reality, that their private affairs might be made public in a way that is unacceptable. At present, costs bear interest from the date of judgment even though the solicitor has not yet submitted the bill, which is strange. This situation is not fair to the party who, ultimately, has to pay the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Section 37 amends section 30 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002. The net effect of the amendment is that interest on legal costs will not be payable until the amount of costs is agreed by the parties or until the costs are taxed or measured. Thereafter the costs will bear interest at a rate specified for judgments from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Section 38 provides that High Court registrars shall in future act as registrars to the Central Criminal Court when it sits in Dublin. The role of assigning persons to act in this capacity is currently carried out by the Dublin County Registrar. Deputies will be aware that the Central Criminal Court now sits on occasions outside Dublin. Section 39 provides for the carrying out of the registrar functions in those circumstances by the local county registrar or a member of the staff of the local Circuit Court office when the Central Criminal Court is sitting at that location.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Sections 40 to 47, inclusive, address the implications of the Valuation Act 2001 for court jurisdiction in property matters, mainly in respect of the Circuit Court. At present, jurisdiction is determined on the basis of rateable valuation and jurisdiction is granted to the Circuit Court where the rateable valuation does not exceed €253.95. The introduction in the Valuation Act 2001 of a new valuation system which more accurately reflects current property values requires a modification of these provisions. These sections change the jurisdiction limit of €253.95 rateable valuation to a market value of €3 million. The term "market value" is defined in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Section 48 and 49 relate to the exclusion of certain witnesses. Section 49 is not now needed and I will propose its deletion on Committee Stage. Section 48 is designed to ensure that witnesses may be excluded from a trial until such time as it is necessary for them to give evidence. This will also prevent them from being informed about what is happening in the court in their absence. This will prevent witnesses being influenced or tailoring their evidence to match what they hear being put to other witnesses in court or what was said earlier in a trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The purpose of section 50 is to amend section 46 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002, which has not been brought into operation, to remove the possibility of judges being required to deliver judgments within prescribed periods but to preserve the purpose of the original provision, which was the requirement for a register of reserved judgments, which will be accessible to the public. I have concerns that section 46 of the 2002 Act, as it stands, might amount to an inappropriate interference with the exercise of judicial functions. The reason for this amendment is to make it clear that there is no such intended interference.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">I indicated some amendments I propose to bring forward on Committee Stage. I am glad to inform the House that, following the approval of the Government, I am also amending the Bill to provide for an increase in the number of the Judiciary — three in the High Court, three in the Circuit Court and two in the District Court, and currently there is a vacancy pending in the District Court. This provision will mean that if the Bill becomes law, the process will be put in place to appoint nine judges in the near future. These increases should go a long way to reduce delays in the courts and to improve their effectiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Among the amendments I intend to table on Committee Stage is one that will provide for certain new possibilities in regard to applications for the issuing of summonses for offences to be tried in the District Court. The amendment will provide for the establishment of an office of the Courts Service, in addition to the ordinary District Court office procedures, to which applications can be made for the issuing of summonses and from which summonses can be issued. The establishment of this new centralised office will not remove the role of the local District Court office in the issuing of summonses in the normal way. It will allow for organisational changes to facilitate the full implementation of the penalty points system — in other words, it will provide for a central application for summons in certain cases where that kind of operation has been carried out. Provision is being made for both the application and the issuing to be carried out by electronic means.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">This Bill is enormously significant in the context of personal injuries actions and the other changes it introduces, and I commend it to the House. There are other aspects I would like to have addressed in the Bill. There are aspects of civil liability law which I had intended to amend, and had canvassed in this regard, such as those relating to voluntary bodies, community activities and raising the bar against claims made against those bodies, but, unfortunately, I had to make a choice. Either I acted now to deal with the immediate insurance premium problem and a compensation culture problem or, alternatively, I waited until complex issues of civil law were teased out at great length and all the legal implications were dealt with. I regret that I have had to compromise by leaving that material out of this legislation, but it is something I will be disposed to revisit if the opportunity presents itself.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_580">I am glad the Minister has acted to bring forward this Bill. The background to the need for it is that this country had become immersed in the compensation culture. The Government has been slow to respond to that development which has become pervasive during the past decade or so. Similarly, its response to the related phenomenon of rip-off Ireland has also been dilatory and grossly inadequate. The Government has been in office for more than seven years and it is only now that the reforms proposed in this Bill are before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">On a related issue, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board has been established but I do not know whether it will have an impact in this regard. It is only in its start-up phase and it has not had an impact to date. However, a number of other aspects have affected attitudes in regard to a compensation culture. The public drew a connection between the awards granted by the courts and the size of insurance premia. That gradually percolated through to members of the public that there was not only a dipping into a bottomless well provided by God knows who but that there was that connection. That helped to change public attitudes.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">We must be careful what we say about judges, but there has been a change of attitude by judges. When I practised as a lawyer there were members on the Bench who were very well known as plaintiffs' judges. All claims are receiving far more scrutiny by judges and, in many instances, have led to the dismissal of cases — in some cases, with the payment of costs. Generally, there has been a more balanced approach to the amount of awards granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Prior to this Bill coming into operation and prior to the PIAB becoming effective, we have had a reduction in the level of insurance premia in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">However, to be fair, it has been a reduction from very dizzy heights in that the cost of insurance premia increased perhaps twofold, threefold or fourfold over the past seven or eight years. Therefore, let us not go wild with enthusiasm. If the establishment of the PIAB and the reforms being introduced further reduce premia, so much the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I have outlined the background to the Bill. While there are some aspects of it that require comment, I will not be opposing it. Its provisions resulted very largely from reports by bodies such as the Law Society — let me declare an interest as I am a member — which have fed into the thinking behind the Bill. The Bill is to be welcomed and my main criticism is that it is "better late than never".</p>
          <p eId="para_586">When talking about the compensation culture, there is a danger of having the pendulum swing too far. I practised as a lawyer and I am not sure my former clients in west Cork, who are now my constituents, have a greater reputation for honesty than those in the rest of the country, but I certainly believe 95% of the claimants were absolutely genuine. There were probably a few who were not and a few who were a bit tough when arranging a settlement or a conclusion to their cases. However, the claims were almost all genuine. It must be borne in mind that there are vested interests, some of which might be very happy to see the pendulum swing too far. I refer to big businesses and the insurance lobby.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">One should bear in mind that most claimants are ordinary Joe or Mary Soaps who have suffered what to them may be a huge calamity. They may have been run down or severely injured, through negligence or otherwise. Let us not forget that they have legal and constitutional rights and that we should not go overboard by way of condemnation or exposure or by saying this is a country in which one should not be able to claim for one's just entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">There are probably two issues of controversy associated with the Bill as it stands. I mention the first with some diffidence because it relates to the Statute of Limitations. When I discussed the Bill with my colleague, Senator Terry, I came to the view that the proposed statutory limitation of one year, which is reduced from three years, was much too short and that the Fine Gael Party should propose, by way of amendment in the Seanad, a two year period. It tabled such an amendment and it was accepted by the Minister. That was a fair and balanced approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">There is still one outstanding issue to which further consideration should be given, namely, the limitation period applicable for medical and clinical negligence cases. These are in a separate category and they are quite complex. From my limited experience in this area, I note that there are difficulties concerning the accessibility of expert evidence. There may even be problems securing a full and proper medical report before proceedings. Sometimes those with few funds may have great difficulty in obtaining medical reports and there might be substantial costs involved. Let us at least examine the legislation to consider whether such medical and clinical negligence claims should be in a separate category.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I am not suggesting anything altogether new in this regard. If one examines the existing provisions, one will note that medical and clinical negligence claims have been placed in a separate category under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act. They have been isolated from the normal run of personal injury claims in that they are excluded entirely from that Act. They were probably excluded because they are so complex and therefore should be in a separate category. However, because they have been excluded the limitation period that now applies in practice will be shorter in regard to such claims than it would be for any ordinary personal injury claim. This is because the limitation period pertaining to PIAB cases is frozen during that board's personal injuries assessment process and for six months after it has ended. Consequently — I see the Ceann Comhairle, a medical doctor, casting his beady eye on me — for such unusual and complex claims, the practical effect is that the statutory limitation will be shorter than it would be for any other claim. If I am correct about this there is certainly a case for considering separately the problems that might ensue.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">From a practical point of view, if one is trying to make a claim of clinical or medical negligence it involves trying to gain access to hospital records. We know the bureaucratic wall that can be erected in this regard. The patient in question might have been treated at a number of hospitals and by a number of doctors, thus causing difficulties, even with the best legal advice available, in trying to assess who is or should be responsible for the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I will return to this issue on Committee Stage. The Minister may argue when making his concluding remarks that because the time limit might operate only from the date of knowledge, it will afford extra time. This would not solve the problem. There are instances that would not be covered by the date of knowledge provision in the 1991 Act. This certainly should be re-examined. There are a number of highly controversial cases being taken at present concerning a number of doctors, one in particular from the Drogheda area, and they highlight the need to take a fresh look at the proposal in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The second controversial issue concerns the proposed changes to the <i>in camera</i> rule. I am glad the Minister has indicated he has been keeping attuned to the debate on this issue because the provision, as currently framed, could lead to very unsatisfactory outcomes. The present section 36 of the Bill is incredibly broad. I see a case for lifting the <i>in camera</i> rule in certain circumstances but it may be necessary to be more specific and to designate who exactly should be entitled to report.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">It is all very well to say one cannot report the names of parties to the proceedings but this is a small country and I am quite convinced that the papers could report a case without mentioning names and yet everybody would know who was involved. This is not fair in many instances and there have been some high-profile cases in the family law area in recent times regarding which it was quite clear who was involved in the reports. If I recollect correctly, some concerned members of the legal profession. We must find a better way and I am glad the Minister has indicated that he is open to suggestions in this regard. It may involve a more specific definition and designating who is entitled to make the reports and the kinds of reports that can be made, whether they are law reports or pertain to PhD students doing theses, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Let us look at it again in more detail. Bodies such as Women's Aid have raised issues which they wish to have looked at. They are anxious to ensure that the legislation should include mention of the clear criteria regarding the detail recorded from family law cases. They want some assurances about the consistent application of rules that would apply and they also indicate that there should be a role for specialist agencies which might want to support participants in family law cases. I can see a case for that. Family law cases can cause huge trauma to some of the parties involved who are in a vulnerable position. It might be right and just to provide support for such people and to make formal recognition of the need for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Other issues arise which will need to be looked at carefully when the Bill is debated on Committee Stage. I will, possibly, table some amendments for the Minister's delectation on the medical negligence issue and I will await the outcome of those.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Section 12 contains a provision which requires the lodgment of pleadings in the relevant court offices after they are served. Should that provision be looked at again? When I practised law that was the normal practice and mountains of paper built up in the various court offices when one was filing notices and particulars of defence or otherwise. It is my understanding that this no longer applies but that the book of pleadings is filed only when the case goes to trial. Is it going to cause all sorts of bureaucratic problems if all pleadings are filed at the time they are served? The point has been made to me that this requirement might put a burden on the Courts Service. Perhaps the Minister will check whether that is so. This may not be a sensible suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The issue of offers and the requirement that offers be made both by the plaintiff and defendant should be teased out further on Committee Stage. How effective will it be, in practical terms, for plaintiffs, in particular, to be forced to make an offer of settlement? I can see why a defendant should be required to make an offer of settlement but I wonder how wise it is to require the plaintiff to make such an offer. If one brings a case before the District Court the limit is currently €6,500 and it is €38,000 in the Circuit Court. By going before the District Court the plaintiff is offering to settle his claim for €6,500 and for €38,000 if he goes before the Circuit Court. We need to look at this provision in more detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I have concerns about section 29, which deals with the maintenance of a register of personal injuries actions. This goes back to my earlier point about the danger of the pendulum swinging too far. This section provides for the establishment of an Internet accessible register containing personal details of plaintiffs and defendants in personal injuries actions.</p>

          <p eId="para_605">The term "occupation" can mean anything, as we discovered during the election campaign when people stated their occupation as peace negotiator.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_606">I am sure we have many peace negotiators, possibly bringing that term into disrepute.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">An implication might develop that the bringing of an action for personal injuries associates the plaintiff with something that is improper, fraudulent or wrong. If that were to be the outcome I would be greatly concerned. I am thinking of the 95% of people who justly claim their proper entitlement and should be encouraged so to do. If this provision were to lead to an impression that such people should be named and shamed <i> à la </i>tax evaders I would be very worried. We must have a democratic system whereby people, with an open mind and heart, are able to go into any court and claim their just entitlements. I would like this provision to be looked at further.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The Law Society brought to my attention a problem which may arise from section 30. This section requires certain persons to provide information. On the face of it, this requirement makes sense and the Minister dealt with this matter in his remarks. While I make no special pleading on behalf of solicitors, they can be in a special category — I speak as a non-practising solicitor. In many instances, solicitors receive documents and records from their clients on a confidential basis. A worry arises that the provision of section 30 might place a solicitor in breach of his professional and legal duty to keep confidential all matters within the solicitor client relationship. I would like to ensure that normal legal professional privilege would not be infringed as a consequence of this section. I will table an amendment on Committee Stage which the Minister might consider for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">A further aspect of the Bill needs to be highlighted and I do not do so in an adverse way. I warmly welcome the proposals regarding mediation. Mediation is not the complete answer to court claims but I have always believed that it has a huge role to play in court claims, particularly in nudging parties towards a fair and just settlement and in saving unnecessary costs. The legal profession is usually blamed for the mounting costs of expert witnesses, engineers, doctors and others. However, solicitors have a job to do and they want to get a fair and just award for their clients. I believe the mediation proposals in the Bill will be fully supported by the legal profession. It will suit lawyers to have claims properly dealt with at an early stage on the basis of a fair mediated settlement, but it might not totally suit the silks who may miss their day in court. The Minister can answer to his colleagues from that point of view. I warmly welcome any provisions which will encourage the mediation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The proposals are, in general, positive and worth supporting. Some of the points I raised may be teased out further on Committee Stage. I am happy to support this Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_611">I too will support this Bill. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe stated, it is a pity we did not get an opportunity to discuss it earlier because of the matters in it that need to be addressed. The Bill addresses the issue of civil liability for personal injuries and seeks to reduce the cost and time taken to settle such actions. That is desirable. The mediation service that has been put in place already is valuable. The Bill also amends the <i>in camera</i> rule on family law, deals with the dormant funds of suitors of the High Court and addresses the implications of the Valuation Act 2001 and the appointment of eight new judges at High, Circuit and District Court levels, a decision taken by the Cabinet at the eleventh hour on 22 June 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">We appear to have a great deal of legislation from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that is neither fish nor fowl. We have already discussed the Proceeds of Crime Bill 1999, the amendments to which were three times the size of the original Bill. While most of it is desirable, it not a proper way of presenting coherent legislation. Bits and pieces have been grafted on. Civil liabilities cases for personal injuries, court procedures in cases of family law or the appointment of a number of extra judges are quite distinct and discrete activities which should not come under the heading "miscellaneous". To my mind that is unsatisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The Minister indicated that the <i> in camera </i>rule requires considerable amendment. That should have been the subject of a separate Bill because it has considerable implications for a different sector of vulnerable people and requires sensitive handling and a different consultative process. The aspect of the Bill dealing with civil liability and personal injuries is a matter of costs and putting the best procedures in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The Bill arises from An Agreed Programme for Government and I note the Minister is working through the programme in that there is proposed legislation in the areas of equality and law reform. It is good to see a proposed scheme on mandatory mediation for the purpose of improving the early settlement of claims, controlling legal and other costs and putting in place measures to punish the presentation and making of false and exaggerated claims in personal injury cases. As part of this we will have the power to deduct from damages the costs for exaggerated claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Unfortunately, there was a long delay in implementing the Motor Insurance Advisory Board recommendations which identified a problem in the culture of personal injuries cases. The non-legal side has been dealt with already in legislation, but the Bill deals with the procedures and the legal costs. The insurance industry traditionally has sky-high costs. Substantial awards have been made, particularly in claims against public authorities. The figures provided by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board show that litigation costs constitute the vast proportion of overall costs, amounting to 40% of the compensation awards in motor accident cases, rising to 46% of the compensation award in cases of employers' liability and to a whopping 56% in public liability cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">There is an element of ambulance chasing in these cases. There is a presumption that Seán or Mary Citizen sees a cash cow and he or she is out to milk it. There is a presumption that fraudulent claims are rampant, but there are no statistics to substantiate that perception. I would like to see an attempt made to produce the figures that would do so. A small percentage of claims are fraudulent and, as Deputy O'Keeffe stated, from his experience it would not be more than 5%, which means 95% of claims are bona fide. Motor insurance premia have always been very high. Last year that sector of the insurance industry made bumper profits. However, the insurance industry always has the poor mouth.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">In November 2003 the Tolka River flooded and I note that insurance companies still demand sky-high premia — they state flood danger as the reason for such high costs — from people living in the vicinity of the Tolka River in spite of the fact that the local authority has invested significant sums in ensuring that the banks of the Tolka River have been and are being strengthened. In the region of €100 million will be spent on remedial works on river banks in Dublin in the next few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">It is not just the compensation culture of Seán Citizen that is responsible for the high premium levels. The hefty profits of the industry has some bearing on it as well. It is realistic to ask whether fraudulent claims can be made without lawyers knowing about them. What struck me when I saw the Bill for the first time was the penalties of €100,000 or ten years' imprisonment for a plaintiff who makes a fraudulent claim. I thought it was blinkered to see the plaintiff as the threat. I issued a statement at that time that did not find favour with the director general of the Law Society of Ireland.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_620">If we were to target the plaintiff, we should also target those people who might be associated with the plaintiffs. The Minister proposes in sections 24 and 25 of the Bill the creation of three new criminal offences, namely, the swearing of false affidavits as to the truth of the plaintiff's or defendant's case; giving or reducing false evidence in a personal injuries action; and giving false instructions to a solicitor. It is noticeable that each of these offences seems to be aimed at litigants.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">How does the Minister propose to deal with rogue solicitors running writ factories, with scatter-guns aimed at all potential defendants with deep enough pockets? We all know that in the absence of a comprehensive system of civil legal aid the legal profession has adopted the practice of offering services on a no foal, no fee basis. If a plaintiff does not win his or her case, then the lawyers do not charge. This is at least a notional breach of the old common law rules prohibiting third parties from having a direct economic interest in litigation. Those rules, though never appealed, are largely ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">I acknowledge there are benefits in the no foal, no fee adage and practice. Even where the defendant wins a spurious case taken against him or her, the plaintiff is not charged by his or her own legal team. Unless he or she has assets that can be seized, the plaintiff will not have to pay the defendant's costs either. Litigation becomes the preserve of the very rich who can afford it and the asset poor who have nothing to lose.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">This state of affairs also gives rise to cases that have no merit but have a nuisance value. A defendant is willing to pay money to settle a bogus action because it will in the long run cost more to defend the case and he or she has no hope of recovering those costs. The lack of a proper civil legal aid scheme means that policy holders and consumers pay the additional costs of an entirely inefficient system of privately-funded litigation that encourages unreasonable expenditure by both sides without risk of penalty. In order to subsidise the cost of the cases they lose, some solicitors may take more than their fair share from the awards given in the cases they win. As well as recovering costs from the losing side, they sometimes charge their own clients a top-up fee paid out of damages.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">In 1995, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was given power by section 46 of the Courts and Court Officers Act to prescribe scales of costs and fees for solicitors and barristers. To date, no such scales have been introduced. As regards the Minister's recent amendment to the Commissions of Investigation Bill regarding tendering for services in commissions, I presume he might have a change of heart in that matter and begin to prescribe some scales of fees for solicitors and barristers.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The Minister is willing to threaten litigants with criminal penalties for taking unmeritorious cases but he is not willing to control the institutional beneficiaries of litigation which statistics show to be the legal profession. Judges like to point out in a different context that if there were no receivers of stolen property, there would be no thieves.</p>

          <p eId="para_632">They are not the people who are targeted for giving false evidence and false affidavits. We cannot simply say that the behaviour of the legal profession is above reproach. We have seen how the tribunals have worked over the last number of years. Eminent lawyers who are the top lawyers in the country, have been making presentations which are dragged out over long periods of time and which have meandered on without coming to any conclusions. It is as if they had an open-ended brief to cross-examine, to question and to go around in circles in their presentation of a case or their cross-examination. That has been something of a scandal and it has brought the legal profession into more disrepute than anything else. Simply to say that the legal profession is clean and above reproach in the matter of personal injuries cases is a simplification of the situation. They need to put their own house in order.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_647">I thank Deputy Mitchell. There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about the provision in Part 3 for dormant funds and that is only <i>déjà vu</i> since this morning. It is proposed that the dormant funds of suitors to the High Court be transferred to the Exchequer in a ring-fenced fashion, to be used for a particular purpose. Deputy O’Keeffe may be able to remind me on this matter. I spent this morning in the nice committee room known as the bunker with the Minister on the other side of the room, arguing that it was virtually impossible to ring-fence any stream of Exchequer funding because it would not be tolerated by the Department of Finance which wanted all the funds in a general pot. The Minister argued that one euro was the same as another euro in Exchequer terms. Now he says that the purpose of this new dormant fund which amounts to €9.4 million or €9.6 million at present, will be used for the benefit of building projects for the Courts Service. It will be ring-fenced for particular purposes relating to the courts. This is a windfall sum of money. The Minister gave a commitment he would ask the Minister for Finance about the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Why can we not get a proper response with regard to the ill-gotten gains from the proceeds of crime the Criminal Assets Bureau has taken from criminals and frozen? This money should be ring-fenced in a special fund and spent on undoing the damage caused by crime, in many cases drug crime, by trying to build up communities undermined by the criminal activities of drugs pushers and other types of criminals. We would do something beneficial and the public would be able to see that the money was being spent in a meaningful fashion. We will return to uses of such funds when the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill comes before the House again.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The third area covered by the legislation is the <i> in camera</i> rule. We have all received submissions setting out the concerns of bodies such as Women’s Aid about how the proposal would operate. There is no doubt that demand for more information about proceedings in the family courts is overwhelming. The <i>in camera</i> rule has operated to the detriment of the operation of the family courts. A veil of secrecy surrounding the courts has had a negative effect. Domestic violence, child abuse and other issues arise in the family courts, which operate almost as a star chamber about which the public has no knowledge. While this is due to legitimate concerns, it also means that no proper statistics or reporting are available. It is possible the family courts operate in an arbitrary manner because we do not know how the judicial process is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">People using the family courts system do not have support because no one, apart from those involved at a specific time, is allowed into the court. Witnesses, for example, must leave the court immediately after they make statements. Resource or support persons are not allowed to accompany witnesses who may, for example, have been subject to rape and may be very distressed. The system must be opened up. The question is how to do this while maintaining privacy and confidentiality. For example, who will conduct the reporting the Minister envisages? Will it be a court reporter? Will the courts issue daily reports to the press? What standards will operate? Will the Courts Service or the Minister appoint a person to report the proceedings or will the media, the newspapers with an interest in these matters, retain somebody, for this purpose? What method of publication will apply and how will it operate? Many questions must be clarified before we can proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I would prefer, therefore, if the section on <i>in camera</i> hearings was included in separate legislation. Where will the sittings take place? How will decisions be made? The legislation is very vague on these matters. Many of the concerns indicated to us by Women’s Aid and other organisations are valid and must be reflected on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The final part of the Bill deals with the appointment of eight judges, a figure which has since increased to nine because, as the Minister indicated, a vacancy has arisen at District Court level. Not long ago, the House passed legislation specifically for the purpose of appointing two new judges to the High Court. The procedure for making such appointments is archaic if specific legislation must be passed to make two appointments. It appears we are unable to make provision for the appointment of judges without passing legislation on every occasion. Perhaps the way to deal with the matter is to graft such appointments into legislation already before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">It is also amazing that only a few short months ago two judges were required and now the Minister has deemed it proper to appoint a further eight or nine judges. From where did this requirement suddenly come? Everybody to whom I have spoken has indicated that additional judges are required on the Bench in all the areas indicated. I have no difficulty with that but that was also the case a couple of months ago when the Oireachtas was passing legislation to enable the appointment of two High Court judges. We asked questions on the matter at the time but did not receive adequate answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">I will return to one or two elements of the Bill. I acknowledge in particular the good work of the Law Society of Ireland. I received a fine document from its director general, Ken Murphy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_656">Yes, he can take a little more cut and thrust than the Minister. A number of sources have taken issue with the timeframe for the statute of limitations and whether it will be one, two or three years. Most people agree that the Seanad probably got it right that a compromise of two years was appropriate. A strong case has been made, however, for extending the statute of limitations for certain medical and clinical personal injury cases because they are more complex. The Law Society regards this as the major issue to be addressed. Mr. Murphy, in his letter, states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_657">.... the Society remains concerned that a two-year period in respect of injuries arising in medical and clinical negligence is too short. Such a short period will have negative consequences for individuals with more serious injuries, such as those resulting from medical negligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The letter then refers to a "Prime Time" programme, which discussed medical negligence and its complexities. The Law Society argues that a special period in excess of two years — effectively three years — will be required to address the complexities of such cases and in those circumstances, I am inclined to agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I received a similar letter from the Limerick City and County Bar Association. It stated that it is, "ironic that the reduction in the limitation period will impact on people who have the most serious category of personal injury." People with the most serious and complex types of personal injury need the maximum amount of time. The association argues that the current three-year level is necessary in such cases. Perhaps the Minister will consider an amendment with a view to improving this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">While I do not intend to address the various sections in detail, I will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage, mainly on procedural issues related to the time and cost of dealing with personal injury claims. While I have no objection to the vast majority of the provisions, some improvements are necessary. The legislation would achieve greater balance by recognising that, in addition to the litigant, the insurance industry, the legal profession and the litigation process must also be examined closely.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Unless that is done, this new legislation to streamline the process will ensure costs are as high as ever and the compensation culture will continue to cause problems. That must be addressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_662">I wish to share time with Deputies Ó Snodaigh, McHugh and Healy.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">No Member disagrees with the need to improve legislation relating to civil liability. The Government, State agencies and local authorities have paid a high price in the past for public liability claims, a number of which were spurious. I was a member of a local authority for almost 11 years and it was frightening that no insurance was available and a sinking fund had to be realised each year to cover potential public liability claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">However, such claims are a heavier cross to bear for the voluntary sector. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs received presentations from several voluntary bodies. They highlighted their insurance burden and the discouragement to people becoming involved in voluntary activities run by agencies that provide social services, which the State is unwilling or unable to provide. This burden is too heavy to be borne by individuals or groups and an attempt to amend legislation in this regard is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The legislation focuses on whether the three-year limit on claims should be amended. The Seanad has decided two years is adequate. However, that may be arbitrary. While the intention is to discourage claims, the effect might be to increase the number of claims made within a shorter period. We must wait and see if that transpires. I expect the effect of the change will be minimal but it will discourage spurious claims that might be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Deputy Costello referred to the Law Society's recommendation that the time limit relating to medical negligence claims should be considered separately so that a longer time limit would apply. I agree with the recommendation. For example, following the birth of a child a medical condition could be identified but the cause may not be identified until years later. Such a time lag is not addressed in the legislation, which only refers to the date of knowledge of the event. There could be a significant time lag between establishing a medical condition and its cause. A similar scenario could apply to people who engage in certain manufacturing processes and who acquire medical conditions such as cancer as a result. While the cancer may be identified early, the cause might not emerge until some time later. If the Bill could be amended to acknowledge the difference relating to medical negligence claims, it would be better.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I refer to dormant accounts and the Minister's conversion to hypothecation. He has been unwilling to acknowledge that money could be set aside and ring-fenced for other purposes in the past under the tax code. However, he is setting out a welcome principle in the legislation that could be applied to all areas of public expenditure. I question whether hypothecating the money for the general upkeep of court buildings is the number one priority for which such funding could be used. Deputy Costello made other suggestions in this regard. The cost of the upkeep of court buildings needs to be examined but funding should be improved because local authorities have carried too heavy a burden in regard to court maintenance. As a result, court buildings have been poorly maintained because such work is not a priority for most local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">This is a double-edged sword. The Bill is intended to reduce the number of claims and the size of awards but the effect of the dormant account will diminish over time because it will not take account of inflation and the Minister will become more reliant on Exchequer funding. This is a sop to those who use our badly maintained buildings to create the impression that funding will be available, even though it will diminish over a long period.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Opinion differs on whether the changes to the <i>in camera</i> rule are positive. The changes are good and their extension should be examined. While the rule is in place to protect participants in family law cases, particularly children, it has often been counter-productive in that documents that could have helped judges making decisions have not been made available. Very often the rule protects the defendants and not the victims, particularly in serious domestic assault cases. Legal academics believe a negative aspect of the<i> in camera</i> rule is the lack of access to documents to analyse trends in family law cases. In addition, garnering knowledge about current cases is hampered because of the rule.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The Bill should also be amended to address the limits placed on people attending family law cases as a result of the rule. Friends and relatives of the parties involved in a family law case may be present to give moral and emotional support but their exclusion often causes unnecessary fear and intimidation, which would not happen if they were permitted to attend the court. The rule prevents them getting involved but consideration should be given to agreements which allow people to attend as a support to participants in cases. An avenue should be opened to allow such people to involve themselves in the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The increase in the number of judges is another element of the legislation. However, I will conclude on the Minister's legislative programme for the long term. He is proposing to introduce many Bills, a number of which will address changes to the Courts Service. The constant stream of short Bills might effect important changes and improvements in the law but it creates a great deal of confusion as to how the law is presented and interpreted subsequently. Surely a case can be made for several consolidating legislative measures. If there is a need for consolidated legislation anywhere it must be in the Minister's Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Perhaps the several dozen Bills, which are still on the Government's legislative programme and with which we are to deal in the lifetime of this Dáil need to be re-examined. Instead of dealing with numerous small Bills we should deal with a small number of larger Bills to tidy up legislation in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_674">I welcome the Bill generally and the provisions of section 31 on the controlled relaxation of the <i> in camera</i> rule in the family law courts in particular. I hope this finally allows for much-needed gathering of statistical information and analysis of the operation of those courts in particular and of family law in general, as that information will help direct other changes in the future. I address that section of the Bill in particular because, while everyone has the right to safety and security in their own homes, domestic violence is truly a scourge of our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">A significant percentage of violent crimes are committed in the home by family members. This violence can be directed towards a spouse, a child or an elderly parent and it is unacceptable in any form, regardless of the perpetrator. However, domestic violence against women is a particularly pervasive problem in society. It affects more than one in five women and, coming up to Christmas each year, we have a campaign to promote and highlight those statistics. Domestic violence devastates at least as many lives as other anti-social crimes or drugs and it needs to become another priority for the Government. That is why I welcome the small change suggested here by the Minister because this issue deserves more attention than it normally gets either from the Government or politicians of all parties. Ending domestic violence in our society requires significantly more resources than have been, allocated by any Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The family law courts play an essential role in protecting women and children from abuse in domestic violence cases through the granting of barring orders, safety orders, judicial separations, divorce orders, maintenance orders and custody and access orders. Two years ago we amended the legislation governing barring orders, which was welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">For many years groups advocating change in this area, such as Women's Aid, have been seeking reform of the <i>in camera</i> rule in a way that protects the privacy and anonymity of those using the courts. In addition, women experiencing violence should not be deterred from accessing the family law courts. The Minister will be aware that Women’s Aid has strongly welcomed the Bill and Deputy Costello mentioned their lobbying on the issue. The group has identified many ways in which the Bill can be strengthened and perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister will take on board our amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">I agree with Women's Aid that the legislation must include specific guidelines on exactly what kind of detail will be recorded in family law cases and what details will be recorded which will be specific to domestic violence cases. At present the Bill is not clear on who will record that information or whether all cases are recorded and, if not, what will determine which cases are selected. I agree with Women's Aid that there needs to be more detail to allow for consistent application of this rule from court to court throughout the State, including clear rules on who is permitted to attend. Crucially, the legislation must provide recognition of the right of women experiencing domestic violence to be accompanied in court by registered specialist domestic violence support agencies such as Refuge and the rape crisis centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The Minister will also know that the National Network of Women's Refuges and Support Services has expressed serious reservations, stating the Bill falls far short of what is necessary to ensure that those most in need can avail of the protections afforded by family law. It has therefore made detailed recommendations on how the Bill can be strengthened in the interests of women and children, specifically recommending that if we are to make progress in improving our system, then the following significant features of all family law cases must be recorded: the age, gender, ethnicity, nationality and family status of applicants, the age and number of children involved, the number and nature of the applications made, whether any previous orders exist, whether domestic violence was alleged or was part of the application, if there was legal representation and whether that was private or legal aid, if there was Garda or health board intervention and the outcome of the application. In applications under the Domestic Violence Act 1996 we need to collect the data on the nature of the alleged violence — whether it was physical, sexual, emotional, psychological, social or financial, whether children were abused, whether a weapon was used, whether orders were breached and the outcome of the application, including any sanctions imposed by the criminal courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">I agree that all of this is necessary to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the safety and sanctions aspects of our system and to pinpoint necessary changes. I fully endorse all the recommendations made by these groups, which will significantly enhance the social effectiveness of the legislation. The Minister is not known for his humility or accountability but, as this is one of our last acts of this parliamentary session, let us try to get it right. We should not have to come back on Report Stage with huge changes and a great many amendments. On Committee Stage I will allow the Minister to put forward amendments and I hope he accepts ours. Far too often on the Committee Stage of justice legislation what we have in front of us has changed substantially when we leave the committee. That is not because of the Minister accepting Opposition amendments but because the Minister tables such a raft of amendments. If more time were spent on those changes before Second Stage, we would have a better run on Committee Stage in dealing with the legislation rather than with Government amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">It is not so long ago that Deputy Costello and I called for more judges to be appointed. At the time, we were dealing with an increase in the number of High Court judges by two and we suggested that there should be a larger increase. The argument at the time was that it would cost additional money in salaries and pensions, which all had to be taken into account. We agreed to that suggestion being shelved for the time being but I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of the need for additional judges and that he will increase membership of the Judiciary by three in the High Court, three in the Circuit Court and two in the District Court. I hope that will deal with the ongoing delays in our courts system and make it more efficient in dealing with not only the aspects of domestic violence which I mentioned, but the other aspects, the court cases with which this legislation will deal and other criminal justice cases.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_682">I welcome the publication of this Bill and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on it. It addresses issues which were a cause of concern to, and aspects which impacted on many people. When addressing legislation such as this, and where to a large degree one is balancing the rights of the plaintiff against those of the defendant, one needs to be extraordinarily careful and as far possible to enter deliberations with an open mind and give due regard to everything. In situations where one can have powerful and influential lobby groups or vested interests, one needs to guard against being unduly influenced by vested interests. Having said that, in the case of interested parties who represent practitioners, one must have regard to their views because they are at the coal face and their members have first-hand experience of dealing with various aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which spent many hours investigating the high cost of insurance, reviewing submissions and meeting interested groups, I have a particular interest in this Bill. The joint committee in its first report, which was issued last year, sought to have certain issues addressed in this Bill. From my reading of the Bill, practically all if not all those issues have been addressed and for that I thank the Minister. Although the issues have been addressed I note the Minister did not arrive at the same conclusions as the committee on many of the items. That is understandable. Perhaps during the passage of this Bill, the Minister may accept some compromises.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Although the Law Society of Ireland could be regarded as having a vested interest in this Bill, it must be recognised as the body which represents many practitioners in this area and therefore due regard must be given to its views. Its view that it is inappropriate, to introduce reductions in the limitation period for medical and clinical negligence cases needs to be fully considered. Medical and clinical cases are the most complex type of personal injury cases and, as such, there is an argument that the limitation period within which claims can be brought in such cases needs to be longer than that applicable to less complex cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The provision to deal with the issue of notification to a defendant who may be facing a claim is welcome. It is totally unfair and is indicative of sloppy procedure that a defendant may not find out until late in the limitation period that he or she is facing a claim. At that stage, much of the evidence, which could have been used by the defendant in his or her defence may have been destroyed. The locus of the alleged accident may have been altered. Video evidence of the activities in the vicinity may have been destroyed and, consequently, evidence in such cases may be very theoretical whereas if the defendant was on notice within a reasonable time frame, the locus and video evidence could be preserved and the defendant would have an opportunity to make a record of the locus before disruption occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The issue of fraudulent or false claims has been highlighted by many as being one of the factors contributing to the high cost of insurance. It is inexplicable that although there was <i>prima facie </i>evidence in many cases that fraudulent claims were being made, no action was taken to punish such fraudsters. The gardaí put this down to a lack of resources. Whatever the reason, action was not being taken and there is an acknowledgement that an industry was being made out of the practice of pursuing, orchestrating and concocting fraudulent claims on the basis that if they failed, no harm was done, nothing was lost and there would be no penalty. It is to be warmly welcomed, therefore, that there is a provision requiring parties to swear an affidavit verifying the contents of pleadings. The consequent provision that a person making a false or misleading statement in an affidavit shall be guilty of an offence is also welcome. This provision should have the effect of reducing the number of fraudulent claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The new section 29 contained in the Bill as passed by the Seanad is a cause of concern. I recognise demands have come from some quarters for the preparation and maintenance of a register of personal injuries actions. However, implicit in that demand is a belief that people who make personal injury claims are somehow doing something improper, fraudulent or objectionable. That is not true for the majority of claimants. The majority of such people, have suffered an injury and are, therefore, entitled to compensation. I referred to fraudulent claims previously and I believe that rather than a general register being compiled, provision to compile a register of fraudulent or false claimants would suffice in this instance and perhaps to placate Deputy Costello, the names and addresses of their legal advisers could be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I thank the Minister for honouring his commitment to amend the Bill to include a provision to require the courts to have regard to the book of quantum when addressing damages in a personal injuries action. The Minister also indicated that the section relating to <i>in camera </i>hearings is being revised and we await the amendment to this section. The Bill addresses many burning issues and is welcome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_689">I welcome the Bill. Many of the sections deal with matters proposed by various interested parties over the years and, as such, I welcome them. There is a number of areas about which I have some concerns. I will briefly address the question about which everyone speaks, namely, the compensation culture. I worked in the public service at local authority and health board levels for nearly 30 years and dealt specifically with this area during many of those years. As has been said by other speakers, my experience is that the majority of claims are genuine and are made by honest, decent people who are neither fraudsters nor are exaggerating their claims. Undoubtedly, there is a minority of false claimants. A climate is being created, to a large extent by insurance companies which wish to tar every litigant and claimant with the same brush.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">In that regard, I have concerns about the register of personal injuries actions. That provision reminds me of some local authorities, which are currently publishing the names, addresses and details of claimants and litigants. I hope that on Committee Stage, some method is found to address this matter. It is being used as a naming and shaming procedure in respect of people who are, in the main, genuine and who have taken legitimate cases which they were entitled to bring and which were found worthy before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">While I understand the Minister has extended the limitation period from the one year as originally proposed in the Bill to two years, my experience, particularly in the hospital service where I worked for 21 years and in medical negligence cases, is that a period of two years is not enough to allow cases to be brought. Many litigants are not anxious litigants in the sense that they would not wish to bring cases if it were at all possible. They often leave it as late as possible to do so. They often find, particularly in medical negligence cases, that the information required is not available with the time limit. It certainly would not be available within the one year time limit and, in my experience, nor would it be available in the two year limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">I would like to see it being maintained at the existing three-year limit. I have come across some industrial cases concerning injuries arising from exposure to asbestos. That type of case is not being dealt with properly within the two-year limit, so the matter should be re-examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">I welcome the relaxation of the <i>in camera</i> rule, which I hope will help in family law cases. Consistency is required in regard to these and other cases generally. A procedure should be put in place for training newly appointed judges because there is substantial inconsistency in sentencing for similar cases dealt with by different judges.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterPowerFF" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Mr. P. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_696">Subject to what I have to say concerning some of its provisions I welcome the legislation, which is long overdue. For at least 20 years it has been widely known that there has been a compensation culture of grossly exaggerated claims in many cases and false claims in quite a number of cases. The Bill represents the first attempt to comprehensively address this culture, which has caused many other spin-off problems. I compliment the Minister for having introduced the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Over the years when I was practising law I tried to identify some of the reasons this compensation culture crept into our country. At the most basic level there is no doubt that an element of greed lies behind all such claims, but it goes deeper than that. At one stage, insurance companies were regarded by some as representing a bottomless pit that could easily be tapped by claimants. In addition, when this compensation culture arose during the 1980s the country was relatively poor so many people used claims as a means to get by. That aspect should not be overlooked. It is clear, however, that once the culture began it became self-perpetuating in that once a person heard about a successful claim by a neighbour or friend — perhaps through anecdotal evidence in pubs or clubs — they became caught up in it themselves claiming more than their entitlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">In addition, when the culture began to manifest itself it was encouraged, by certain — and I use that word advisedly — members of the legal profession. The results of the compensation culture that grew up are manifold, but two spring to mind. First, there was the huge increase in insurance premia which drove many companies out of the market and led to many people becoming uninsured including many young drivers who could not obtain cover. A second result of the compensation culture was that the good name of many in the legal profession was called into question and sullied by a few who, unfortunately, for reasons of human nature, became caught up in that culture. The country is now wealthy and we have moved on from that period so we need to call a halt to such activity. The wide-ranging manner in which the legislation is drafted sends out that message clearly and fairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">I welcome the Minister's amendments to the legislation as initiated and he must be commended for having listened to the substantial arguments made concerning the statute of limitations period. As a member of the Law Society, I must disclose an interest but it is fair to say that all credit is due to the society for having done a decent day's work on behalf of its members. The arguments put forward by the Law Society were self-evident, including that the reduction from three years to one year would undoubtedly have given rise to serious injustice in a sizeable number of cases, although it is impossible to quantify how many. For that reason the Minister is to be commended for introducing that amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Part of the arguments made during the debate on the legislation became lost, by concentrating on the amendment to the statute of limitations, which is secondary to the real intent of the Bill — to defeat bogus, fraudulent and exaggerated claims. Having said that, I still consider that injustices may occur due to the reduction in the statute of limitations period, particularly concerning medical negligence and other complex cases. Since consumer litigation is more prevalent nowadays, it is becoming exceptionally difficult even to identify who the defendants in a particular case are, given the nature of modern multinationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Some flexibility should be provided where a plaintiff is making a genuine attempt to claim within the statute of limitations. In the interests of justice and equity if such a claim was to be defeated merely on the basis of having passed the statute of limitations, some discretion should be given to the Judiciary in that regard. The same principles also apply to the two-month notification rule because the same rationale could give rise to an injustice, albeit one that is not quite as serious. That matter should be teased out on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">A distinction needs to be made between exaggerated and false claims. Human nature being what it is, people will not minimise claims, so they will put their best foot forward in articulating the impact and injury they may have suffered. A false claim, however, is an entirely different matter. The legislation represents a tough but fair response to the compensation culture behind false claims. In that context, the Minister is to be complimented on the Bill's provisions, which are practical and wide-ranging. Individual provisions will be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage, including the general endorsement of claim. It is only logical, right and proper that that should be made known to the defendant at an early stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The provision of section 12 concerning the swearing of an affidavit, is a vital component of the legislation. As anyone practising in this area will know, far too often the claimant and plaintiff have been hiding behind the shield of the lawyer, saying it is the lawyer making the claim whereas in reality we all know that a claimant should sign up to the claim and should have no difficulty in swearing an affidavit to that effect. That in itself will encourage — if that is the correct word — the people in the legal profession who prepare these claims to tell their clients that the onus is on them to sign up to and swear their case. Other provisions such as the mediation service are self-evident and logical and must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I compliment the Minister on section 18 in respect of court-appointed experts because, much too often in very contentious cases, judges do not know who to believe because experts on either side can be equally compelling. No one envies a judge's job in this respect and they should be in a position to request an independent third party, whether they are medical or engineering experts, to give his or her view. This aspect of the legislation is especially welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Section 25 represents the key to the Bill. If one component of a claim is proved to be deliberately false or misleading, the claimant should be left in no doubt by his or her advisers that his or her claim will fail. This is why I made a distinction between false and exaggerated claims. The majority of claims have a clear basis in fact but difficulties have been caused by their gross exaggeration. The smallest slip resulting in minor soft tissue damage in the local supermarket can be exaggerated out of all proportion. Claimants should be in no doubt at this stage that we are calling a halt to that culture and practice. The legislation is fair and balanced in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Although I did not expect it in the Bill, an innovative provision in it allows the judge in any case to exclude witnesses from trials. In more complex cases, certain witnesses feed off the evidence of other witnesses and what might begin as a minor exaggeration of what might have happened in a case is suddenly exaggerated out of all proportion by subsequent witnesses. This is a sensible and practical suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">It is no one provision in this Bill but rather a combination of all of them which represents a tough but fair and balanced response to a culture which has developed in Ireland. No one can say adequate warning will not be given to people or that they will be short changed. However, everyone will know that if they try to take on the system, the sanctions will be tough. The financial sanctions are not tough enough, but that can be discussed on Committee Stage. For all these reasons, the Bill must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I ask the Minister to examine the brevity of the two month warning notification period to the defendant because I have my doubts about it. This is because the majority of genuine claimants are not the sort of people who rush to see their lawyers on the way to hospital. Rather, they take their time to get better before approaching them. I support the Bill and commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_709">I thank Deputy Peter Power for sharing time with me. In many cases in an adversarial justice system, a litigant is under extreme pressure giving evidence. Under cross-examination by a skilled barrister, a litigant can often say things that he or she may not have represented when the pleadings were prepared. Nonetheless, I have no fear that there is anything in the Bill of concern in that respect because, when it comes to the issue of the Director of Public Prosecutions proposing to prosecute an offence or of a judge deciding to award costs to penalise someone, there is wide discretion. However, we must not forget that litigants give evidence under extreme pressure and may not represent their case properly to their own detriment.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">In general, I support the Government's policy in regard to the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, fraudulent claims and the work the various Departments are engaged in. I am a barrister and have worked on personal injuries cases for both plaintiffs and defendants. In spite of the fact that these provisions will work against the financial interests of lawyers, as Deputy Peter Power pointed out, many abuses are taking place and there is a great deal of fat in the system which needs to be cut out. I am pleased the Minister has conceded on some of the points on which he was lobbied in the Seanad when the Bill was taken in that House.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">In the United States, the Statute of Limitations in regard to medical negligence cases is two years. I never believed the Minister was that serious about his proposal to make the Irish Statute of Limitations just one year. Moreover, in the US, the limitation period carries exceptions. For example, in one state there is a continuing care principle, whereby the clock does not begin to run until the patient is out of the care of the doctor, hospital or health board equivalent. In another state, a 90 day extension of the medical negligence Statute of Limitations can be applied for and, in another case, the controls only apply if the value of the case is in excess of a given amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The general thrust of this acknowledges that medical negligence is slightly different from other types of personal injury actions which come before the courts. Furthermore, when one examines the discovery rules that apply to medical negligence, there are also exceptions which have been built up over years of experience in acknowledging that it is much more difficult to put together a medical negligence case as compared with, for example, an ordinary personal injury case arising out of a motor accident. We should not ignore the experience which has given rise to such different rules in Ireland and in the US which acknowledge that we have a different set of requirements for medical negligence litigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The Law Society has asked the Minister to keep the limitation at two years, with which I agree. If it is not broken, do not fix it. I have not heard the case made in regard to abuse of medical negligence cases. I have been lobbied by the Spinal Injuries Association of Ireland and Headway Ireland on this issue, both of which organisations deal with serious traumatic injuries. Both organisations were of the view, before the Minister conceded to a two year Statute of Limitations, that those types of traumatic injuries are very difficult to bring to the attention of a solicitor because often the last issue with which one is concerned is the litigation that might flow from an injury one has suffered. The Law Society has made its point clearly and I hope the Minister will acknowledge that, especially in respect of medical negligence cases that give rise to these more serious injuries, there is a need for some kind of exception to be written into the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Another example in regard to medical negligence arises from my own experience in a number of cases, whereby one must always obtain a medical report from someone overseas because, naturally enough, an Irish doctor will not give a medical report stating that a patient was wrongly treated, operated on or not properly informed about the consequences of a procedure. One must therefore often go overseas to get such information which adds time to the process. This again underlines the difference between medical negligence and ordinary personal injuries actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I came across a case in which, as the expiration of the statute approached, the only action which could be taken was to serve writs against multiple doctors. Once the issues crystallised later on, it was then possible to identify the correct defendants in the case. Writs then had to be withdrawn against the other doctors and costs were disputed. If the limitation is brought back from three to two years, it will make that problem much worse. There is also the danger that it will create an even greater division between doctors and patients. One of the major concerns of surgeons and general practitioners is the danger of litigation. To contract the time available in which to make a claim would create more problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">In regard to the letter of claim, like Deputy Power I am not sure if this is necessary. One can imagine a litigant walking into a solicitor's office six or seven weeks after an injury. If the person is a genuine <i>bona fides</i> litigant, he or she will not jump into the nearest solicitor’s office but will wander in later. This will put pressure on a solicitor, especially in the smaller officers. They will have to seek advice on whether it is appropriate for a letter of claim. I agree we should consider removing this requirement, as it is unnecessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The general principle underlying some of the weaker parts of the Bill is that the personal injury litigant is a more indolent species than the other type of litigant. The approach suggests that a personal injury litigant should be tough, have a stiff upper lip and take the injury like a man. I find that principle in the requirement for a verifying affidavit. There is no other type of litigation that requires this. Obviously a special summons requires an affidavit. For example, if I sue a person because he or she owes me money for a breach of contract or I sue my neighbour for being a nuisance, I do not have to swear an affidavit that the contents of my pleadings are true. Therefore, why does the personal injury litigant have to do this? I do not have a problem with it but I would like to see it extended into all areas of legal procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The personal injury litigant, the plaintiff in other words, is the lightning rod for all of our legislation in recent years. There are many fraudulent people within the contract law area. A great deal of time is wasted in the commercial courts, as the Minister will be aware from his own experience. I hope there will be a level playing field in terms of the application of this requirement to those in such categories.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Sections 9 and 10 deal with an application that can be made to the county registrar, which I presume will be in the Circuit Court, to strike out cases where particulars have not been complied with in a personal injury summons. We are adding a layer that is not required. I am concerned as to whether that is necessary. It is not a major concern but I hope it will be considered on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Section 14 concerns the mediation conferences. Having had experience of this type of mediation conference I wonder about them. These were introduced about ten years ago in the Law Library and have never caught on. Effectively, it adds a third person to a settlement which will not cut back on costs. Barristers will be delighted to hear there is work available.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The issue of expert evidence is of concern. Who will examine the experts' evidence in chief? Who will ask them the necessary questions? The court can order that the expert evidence of the court be given on affidavit. Naturally the evidence will favour one side or the other. Somebody will want to cross-examine the expert. There will be a notice of intention to cross examine. Is there a danger of bringing in another layer of bureaucracy? I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_288">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_722">I oppose the Bill, in the main because of its latter section and the announcements made outside the House about the appointment of yet more judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">In 1987 I published a Private Members' Bill, the reform of the courts administration Bill. I spoke with Ms Justice Denham when preparing her report which gave rise to the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 and some of my views were taken on board. It disturbs me that when a Member like me rises to put forward genuine, considered and, I hope, well-argued concerns about aspects of the Bill, he or she is much too easily put down as anti-lawyer. I am not against anybody. I am on the side of the public interest. I am here to speak on an issue, which is of serious concern to me and I ask the Minister and the House to address my concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The method of appointing judges remains something of a mystery. It is that aspect of the Bill to which I wish to confine my comments. Those who are interested in appointment and are otherwise qualified apply to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which, as a general rule, sends at least seven names to the Government for consideration, as provided for in section 16 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995. Where fewer than seven persons apply or where the board is unable to agree recommendations for the names, the names of all applicants are submitted to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This legislation has created the myth of non-party political selection. In reality, with at least seven names to choose from, the Government always gets its man or woman, so to speak. The Oireachtas should repeal this provision to protect the Judiciary from being associated, however inadvertently, with what has become a political smokescreen.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The membership of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board includes the Chief Justice, who is the chairperson, the Attorney General, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court, a nominee of the Bar Council, a nominee of the Law Society and three others. There is little outside input. The Oireachtas does not vet these appointments so the representatives of the people in the Oireachtas are not consulted.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">On 22 June last, the Government, according to a press announcement, sanctioned the appointment of eight new judges "to speed up the hearing of cases in the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court". Speaking in the Dáil the following day I said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_727">The number of judges has doubled since 1960. They are as capable of being corrupt as any politician, journalist, civil servant or other person, and the expansion of the Judiciary in this way is unacceptable ... The House should conduct an independent assessment of that. It could be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">It was further announced at that time by the Government that provision to appoint the new judges would be made by an amendment to the Civil Liability and Courts Bill which is before the House and which the Government hopes will be enacted before the summer recess. This major amendment to the Bill, announced outside the House, is to be rushed through the Dáil and Seanad in a matter of days.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">No case has been made to Dáil Éireann for these additional appointments nor has there been any independent assessment of need. Furthermore, the leader of the Bar, the Attorney General, sits at Government. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a senior counsel and many Members of the Government are personally close to and friendly with judges and senior legal figures. There is nothing particularly wrong with this but there is something wrong with the process which leads to a never-ending increase in the number of judges without any independent assessment of need being presented to Dáil Éireann, and with the reasonable suspicion of specialist pleading by lawyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">In 1961, there were four Supreme Court judges, six High Court judges, eight Circuit Court judges and 28 District Court judges, a total of 56. In 2003, there were seven judges in the Supreme Court, 27 in the High Court, 30 in the Circuit Courts and 52 in the District Courts, giving a total of 109. Eight new judges are to be appointed. Additional judges were appointed gradually in each of the years 1973, 1977, 1979, 1981,1985, 1991 and 1995. Judges were appointed twice in 1997, with further appointments being made in 2002 and 2003. This has been done without significant change in work practices or accountability to the Oireachtas for the resources, which have had to be provided. While judges are and must remain independent in the exercise of their duties, it is a matter for the Dáil to allocate from taxpayers' funds the resources it deems necessary to fund the public services of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The increase in the number of judges has not been justified to Dáil Éireann. While lawyers and other insiders suggest regularly that the number of judges here is low compared to other European states, I simply do not know whether they are comparing like with like. As a Member of the Dáil representing taxpayers, I should know that. An independent assessment on behalf of the Dáil should be made before decisions in this area are taken. Not only is the Judiciary expanding, more than any other institution it blurs the distinction set out in the Constitution on the separation of powers of the institutions of the State. For example, it was a mistake on the part of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to allow itself to be called before the court in the Abbeylara case. I do not suggest that issues of natural justice should have been brushed aside, rather the sub-committee should have asked for the permission of the Dáil and Seanad before agreeing to such an appearance. To seek such permission would have made it clear that the summoning of Oireachtas committee members to attend court was not a routine affair.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">In setting out the rights and duties of each institution, the Constitution does not accord overall superiority to anyone and no institution should be allowed assume such superiority. The increase in the number of judges should involve new provisions to ensure greater transparency in the way they conduct their business. The resignation of two senior judges in the recent past left many questions unanswered. These include questions about the nature of the relationship between counsel and judges, what takes place in judges' chambers and the ethical provisions, if any, which are in place to ensure that judges are beyond question in the execution of their duties. Some court practices appear to be as out of date as wigs and gowns, by which remark I do not intend to cause offence to people in the Law Library, I simply wish to make the point. Clearly, more reform is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">While I am an admirer of the independence of the courts, the Constitution requires that other institutions should be independent also. The Dáil is independent of the courts in the fulfilment of its duties and it is to Dáil Éireann that an assessment on the need for an ever-increasing number of judges should be presented. Such an assessment should not be prepared and presented by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Attorney General but by the Dáil's own constitutional servant, the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Government of the day should no longer be allowed to adopt a piecemeal approach to the appointment of an unlimited number of judges. As the years go by, it is possible and even likely that we will continue to see proposals for the appointment of more and more judges if current arrangements continue in place. Those who claim we need more judges should submit their case to be assessed on the basis of an independent report, which includes an examination of procedures and practices in our courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">I have tried to make my case as reasonably and fairly as I could. While I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not agree with my case, it is a reasonable one. We cannot continue to appoint judges in this way. The Minister and the Attorney General are not the people to make these assessments, it is a matter for the House, which involves the use of resources. It is a question of the independence of the House in terms of its duty to assess the needs of another institution. Each institution has certain duties and among those of the Dáil is the duty to taxpayers to ensure that we do the right thing when committing resources or overseeing matters of law. If the Comptroller and Auditor General were to assess the issue and declare a need for 150 judges, so be it. However, I do not accept a procedure whereby appointments are made incrementally, as happened over the years I listed, and in a manner so offhand that announcements are made outside the House and provisions attached to legislation, which has almost nothing to do with the appointment of judges. That is not a proper way to appoint judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">I wish to make my point as subtly as I can in the presence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We must be careful to ensure we do not debase the currency. The more judges we appoint, the more potential difficulties we create. The issue must be addressed. I ask the Minister not to proceed with this section of the Bill until an independent assessment of the need to appoint more judges has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">I hope the Minister addresses the following in his reply to the debate. Will the Minister tell the House how often the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board meets and how many names have been put forward for each appointment? I have deliberately made a short speech as I wanted to make a deliberate point and perhaps the Minister will reflect on its contents when he has a moment. While we may not agree on everything, I consider the Minister to be a reasonable man and I ask him to listen to what I am saying. This is an issue of public interest. We must all step back from the wood at times if we want to see the trees.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">I have raised a valid point. If there is a case to be made for more appointments, let it be made in the way I suggest. An independent assessment should be made on behalf of the House by an officer who has constitutional status and status conferred in law by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 and the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, and who can by law have other duties conferred on him by resolution of the House. He is the constitutional person who should make this assessment on behalf of the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DennisODonovan" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Mr. O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_738">I listened with interest to Deputy Gay Mitchell's contribution. To make an observation, not a criticism, extra judges are appointed, to whichever court, where the need arises. It has been my experience over the past 20 years that the absence of a sufficient number of judges has created significant backlogs and waiting lists in civil and criminal law. This has cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money. Many of the extra judges have been appointed to the High Court recently as up to seven judges are seconded to do tribunal work which, as a public representative and a lawyer, is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">I have a particularly biased view of tribunals, which I made public in 1982. A system of tribunals is the wrong one to operate. They have made fat lawyers fatter. I expounded my views on the airwaves in the 1980s that tribunals are inappropriate except in cases like the Whiddy or Stardust disasters, which involved significant loss of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Tribunals that examine issues such as planning corruption, etc., are bad value for taxpayers' money. I hope the Minister takes on board my view of the abuse and disregard of the tribunal system over the past decade. When anything goes wrong now, there is a demand for a tribunal but of what benefit are they? Does Joe Soap or the taxpayer get value for money from them? They do not, whether it is a beef tribunal or any other. It is shameful and regrettable that we accept a tribunal can run for 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on it and the forward-thinking and positive legislation his hard work is producing in the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">We have introduced the PIAB in an effort to speed up cases and reduce costs and red tape etc. However, I am somewhat uneasy with regard to the cost of court cases. One issue that bugs me, as a solicitor since the late 1970s, is the cosy cartel that exists between certain insurance companies, firms of lawyers and small cliques of barristers, both senior and junior. These cartels have existed unchallenged for at least three decades, to the detriment of the motoring and general public. No doubt, the reason the old PMPA insurance company got bogged down financially and overcome by problems was that this arrangement existed.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">I am aware of cases such as one where an injury occurred in west Cork and the case was settled in Dublin. The defendant, gardaí and witnesses involved were never called to Dublin to state the case and it was settled behind closed doors, on what grounds I do not know. In some instances settlements are wrong, and totally exaggerated in others. The Minister must examine the issue of these cosy cartels that exist between large insurance companies and small numbers of solicitors and barristers.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">My solution to the problem is to use the same tendering system for lawyers that we have used in the case of some local authorities. The local authority in Cork, of which I was a member for almost 19 years, uses the same system. It adopted the practice of seeking tenders from firms of solicitors throughout the county because of the volume of work involved in purchasing and selling land for housing etc. The local council's practice is carried out through a fair and open tendering process. The firms in Bantry, Bandon or Kinsale etc. are informed the council is embarking on the purchase of land for housing and tenders are sought from them. This is a great idea and should be compulsory across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The PIAB already shows the signs of being a success. All dealings with insurance companies that have obligations to the public should use this tendering process when engaging solicitors, perhaps on a regional basis. Some local authorities use the process for both civil and criminal issues. Why should Cork or Dublin city councils or boroughs, where huge volumes of claims exist against the local authority, select one firm only. Our experience is that the legal teams in the county solicitors' offices in various counties or local authorities were over-burdened by this work and were obliged to hive it out to others. This should be done on the basis of a tender and I urge the Minister to make this compulsory.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The current thinking in Departments and Oireachtas committees is that where lawyers, firms of solicitors, barristers, junior and senior counsel are required, this tendering process should be properly regulated and made compulsory so that we have a transparent system where taxpayers get value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I am not a member of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, chaired by Deputy Cassidy, but I am interested in the insurance area, which is a hobbyhorse of mine. That committee invited several insurance companies for discussion and I attended the meeting and raised the issue of using the tender process. However, I regret I got no answer from those companies on the issue. The Irish insurance industry should be open and transparent. That one or two firms in a region such as Leinster can have a monopoly on civil or criminal litigation, from whatever source, is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I am amazed when I examine the publications showing the various solicitors and counsel who do so well out of the free legal aid system. Inevitably, we see the same half dozen or so names on the list, whether in Cork, Dublin or the west. Are there no other solicitors involved or are they not part of the free legal aid scheme? The system is unfair and a tender process would give much better results.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">We are discussing a civil liability Bill but, whether we are dealing with civil or criminal law, the one point I want to make is that to save future costs we must introduce a clear and transparent tender process for legal services. Every Department, agency, health board, Oireachtas committee, local authority etc. should seriously consider this. It is unacceptable for these authorities inevitably to continue to use the same firm or cartel in accident or injury cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">The Civil Liability and Courts Bill 2004 is a far cry from the 1963 Bill I studied in college. Many changes have taken place over the years to the benefit of taxpayers, motorists, litigants and the legal system. This Bill, following the establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, is a further step towards ensuring that legal costs are controlled.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">I listened to some of the Seanad debate on this Bill and compliment the Minister on it. Section 6 proposes to amend the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 1991, reducing the limitation period for personal injuries actions from three years to two to ensure claims are brought forward in a timely manner. The Minister had proposed to reduce the time limit to one year, something with which I did not agree. However, he must be given credit for listening to the arguments made in the Seanad and increasing the period to two years. A two-year period is fair and is an excellent compromise for deciding what is fair or unfair, particularly in tricky negligence cases or ones where people of tender age or unsound mind are involved in an accident or injury. Three years may have been too long, but one year would have been seen as mean. The Minister was sensible to accept this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">I welcome the provision in section 7 that if a plaintiff fails to serve a notice on a defendant within two months of the date of an accident or the date of knowledge, he or she may be penalised in costs and the court may draw such inference from the failure to serve the notice as appears appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">I was a practising solicitor for many years. From a financial point of view, perhaps I should have remained one given that the joys of politics have been kind and unkind to me in that it has taken me 15 years to get elected to the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">I wish to deal with the defence side of a case. A person who hurt his or her back, fell off a wall in County Monaghan or was involved in a car crash in west Limerick could make a claim and two years and eleven months following the incident proceedings may be issued on behalf of that person. This was the practice in many cases up to recent times but that practice is changing in light of current legislation and court practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">A defendant in such a case would go to court five years after the incident. It could take six years if the case was being heard in Cork given the delays involved, unless the case was heard in Dublin. However, there are logistical difficulties in arranging for medical and engineering experts to travel to Dublin. On the day of the hearing, the medical report of a consultant, be it a surgeon or some other qualified professional, would be read and the defence would have no prior chance to challenge it. The trend was that the legal representatives on one side of a case would obtain a medical report and by hook or by crook they would not show it to the legal representatives on the other side. That practice persisted and it was an appalling way to conduct business.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Only in extreme circumstances should qualified consultants, whether engineers, orthodontists, consultant surgeons or neurosurgeons, be required to appear in court. We have a shortage of such experts. I am aware of cases where the only consultant surgeon in Bantry General Hospital at the time had to be present in the High Court when it sat in Dublin for one or two weeks, and in many instances he was not required.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The system the Minister is advocating is that the legal representatives concerned should show their hands from an early stage. For example, a legal representative on one side should advise the legal representative on the other side that his client, John Murphy, sustained certain injuries, he should outline the circumstances and inquire if the two sides can agree X, Y and Z to process the case in a fair and proper manner. We should go a step further and require a consultant who is qualified, experienced and independent, whether an engineer or an architect, to submit a declaration or affidavit that the statement is his or her evidence, and in so far as possible, such evidence could be agreed in the pleadings before the two sides go to court. That would save the cost of standby fees for a consultant or GP.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">It is a few years since I was in the High Court in Cork when it dealt with civil hearings during three weeks in July in the warm weather and a plethora of 20 or 30 GPs were standing around on call. Consultants and various experts were present like the gathering of a herd. I am sure the Minister was familiar with the old Cork Courthouse. Conditions there were below the standard, which is currently acceptable. When I was practising there the condition of the toilets was such an embarrassment that people used the facilities in a hostelry across the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The Minister is endeavouring to address the practice of the cloak and dagger approach, the secrecy that surrounded the legal system and the notion that one side would appear in court with surprise witnesses and reports. We should put that practice to bed for once and for all and move forward into the 21st century and away from the legal tactics and policies that were more appropriate in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">One of the most salient features of this legislation is covered by section 13 which deals with combating false and exaggerated personal injury claims. It is about time that a Government, Cabinet and Minister grasped that nettle. Having been a legal practitioner since the 1970s, I was aware of clients who have claimed that their back pain was worse than it was and of men who have fallen off the roofs of houses claiming that they will never work again and we would have gone to make a killing against a local builder. The approach taken in many cases was short-sighted, given that the injuries sustained were not as serious as they were claimed to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I recall a retired Circuit Court judge in Cork, Judge Murphy, commenting that some questionable, if not fraudulent, claims came before him. Sometimes it is difficult for a judge to make a call in a case. I am delighted that at long last in this legislation any person who makes such a claim will not only not be financially rewarded but will face criminal charges, which is a positive step.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">In section 14, the Minister provides for a new development of mediation in civil law. This system of mediation is common in Canada and Australia. This is a progressive proposal for our judicial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">I am an associate of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland which along with the Bar Council may have had reservations about the establishment of the PIAB. When one introduces changes that are futuristic and which drags the legal system, process and thinking into the 21st century, the impact of those changes hurt people in their pockets. It impacts on the train of thought they have had for 30 or 40 years. The suggestions in the Bill are brave. The Law Society and the Bar Council should be prepared to admit that these changes will benefit those august bodies into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">I have only covered half of the points I wanted to make but I hope those, I made will be taken on board by the Minister. I compliment him on the legislation. Despite his critics, he should keep up the good work. This is the type of legislation about which, in ten or 20 years' time, law students, legal experts and practitioners, consultant surgeons and orthodontists will say the Minister and the Government did well and they were moving in the right direction.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_767">I welcome the Bill in principle but I have little time to broaden the discussion on it. The Bill seeks to deal with the our compensation culture, about which I have had grave concerns in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The issue of dormant account funds is being dealt with in the Seanad in regard to another area. The Minister is also going to try to nobble the use of dormant accounts on this end. Are we using such money to deal with issues that should be dealt with from national funds? I have an interest in ensuring that the courthouses in Clones and Castleblayney are restructured, but I would have thought the payment for such works should come from other funds. I question that part of the Bill and the direction in which we are moving.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">A previous speaker spoke about all the good work that had been done. The Minister said that section 30, will remedy a fault in the PIAB Act that was only passed a few months ago. However, I wish to deal with the issue of insurance costs. As a former member of a local authority, I know the insurance costs involved and the attitude towards taking claims against a public body such as a local authority. There is also the issue of claims made in the medical field. Questionable claims have been made against the maternity services and facilities at Monaghan General Hospital. Insurance is a major issue. High insurance costs have had a serious impact on the voluntary sector and, if not addressed, there could be an end to many of the voluntary support structures in place, which will cost the State a great deal of money in the long term. In that sense I welcome the Bill in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Insurance claims are still the major problem and insurance charges have certainly caused significant job losses where industry and businesses generally have to compete across the Border. For example, a paintball company owner living and working in Monaghan has to pay €15,000 in insurance while a competitor, who lives in Northern Ireland but also works in Monaghan, is charged only €1,500. How can people possibly compete if this is the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Let us consider medical negligence. The Minister states that a time limit of two years pertains to claims for medical negligence. Drogheda hospital is an outstanding example of a case in which claims took a long time to make. I had personal involvement in another case. My brother died in England from asbestos poisoning 15 years after he left the job that led to his infection. It took ten years to diagnose the problem. Therefore, there are specific issues that need to be handled very carefully and a blanket provision does not cover all eventualities. I welcome the fact that the Minister agreed to the Fine Gael motion in the Seanad to change the one-year period to a two-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Can the Minister indicate how many claims are fraudulent? I ask this in the context of all the big advertisements by the legal profession chasing claims. Is there provision in the Bill to ensure that members of the legal profession who encourage the making of claims, and who may be well aware that that certain claims are dubious, can be found guilty of negligence and fraud if such cases are lost? If there is no such provision, can the Bill be amended accordingly? The ordinary sinner should not be the only person found guilty. Accountants must bear costs. Why should solicitors not do so also?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_773">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Civil Liability and Courts Bill. I particularly wish to refer to the amendment of the <i>in camera</i> rule, as contained in certain statutes relating to family law, to allow publication of reports of proceedings so long as the report does not contain any information which would identify the parties or any child to which the proceedings relate. I have been raising this issue for some time. A key aspect of our justice system is that it is open to public scrutiny and can be evaluated by citizens. Another aspect is that legislators can evaluate and examine how legislation operates in practice through the media reports on the effects of legislation. Publication of information will assist the public and legislators to evaluate the effectiveness of our legal system.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The family courts have taken an increasingly central role in the legal process in overcoming difficulties in relationships, particularly regarding the custody of children. We should examine whether our family courts protect the rights of children to know their parents and to be parented by both parents, regardless of whether they are married or divorced. Family law cases in this area usually deal with parents whose marriages have broken down or who are divorced. Children should be central to the issues examined by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">A child should have automatic access to both parents. We must evaluate whether the family law courts are operating according to this premise. A child should have the right to know and have access to all elements of his or her family tree, including genealogy and medical information. Society and the State should support mothers and fathers equally, for the benefit of society as a whole, in seeking to be equally involved in the shared parenting of their children, both within relationships and marriage and through the promotion of the concept of joint custody of the children as a normal expectation in the cases of separation and relationship breakdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">I cannot judge what role our family courts play in this regard because of the <i>in camera</i> rule. The removal of this rule will allow us to make such a judgment. It will also discipline the family courts on the basis that society, the media and the Oireachtas will be more aware of the effects of the outcome of cases and how the courts approach very sensitive and serious issues, especially those pertaining to children. Of course the issues are very important to the parents but I am referring to the rights of children in a society that has changed dramatically in the past 40 years and the need for systems and approaches to respond to those changes in a way that is of maximum benefit to children. I believe that in all but exceptional circumstances children should be parented by both parents.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_294" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_777">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this afternoon's proceedings, particularly those who supported the Bill and who made nice remarks about its contents. I appreciate the positive tone of much of what was said, which is not to say that everybody was an unalloyed cheerleader for the legislation. It would be strange if that were the case because this is an adversarial process and Members are mandated by the electorate to ask searching questions of what is put before them and not to accept things at face value.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">It was particularly interesting to hear Deputy Gay Mitchell who took pains to put across, in what I would describe as measured tones, the case that no more judges should be appointed at this juncture. He suggested that the Attorney General and I were the wrong people to ask whether there should be more judges and that the Attorney General should objectively assess how many more we need. I fully agree with him in the sense that the process should not be one in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can wander into the House and simply say we need more judges without somebody making an objective assessment at some point in the process as to whether more are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">One point that Deputy Gay Mitchell forgets is that government is a slightly more complex process than is assumed and that a person in my position cannot simply place a memo on the Cabinet table and click his fingers to produce more judges because he feels like doing so on the basis of his having looked at the morning newspapers. The critical view of the Department of Finance on whether more judges are needed must also be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">On this occasion, in contemplating whether more judges were needed, I had regard to the remarks of Ms Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, chairperson of the Courts Service Board. In reference to a recent case, she made the point that there are fewer judges in Ireland per head of the population than in other European and common law countries. One can talk about European countries but one is not comparing like with like when comparing European judges with Irish judges. They do different things. European judges have an investigative function and they begin their careers at the age of 21 or whatever and rise in the judicial service on the basis of promotion.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">It is interesting to note that we share a common law system with a number of other countries and therefore the figures I have available might interest the Members of the House, Deputy Gay Mitchell in particular. In Ireland we have one judge, be it in the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court or Supreme Court, per 32,000 of our population.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">In Northern Ireland the ratio is one judge per 29,000. In England and Wales it is one judge per 15,000, which is half as many people per judge as we have. In Scotland it is one judge per 19,000, in Canada it is one judge per 15,000, in Australia it is one judge per 21,000 and in New Zealand it is one judge per 22,000. Among comparable common law countries, Ireland has the highest ratio of people to judge. I make this point because Deputy Gay Mitchell probably needs some reassurance on it. We do not have a massive number of judges per head of the population. That does not dispose of his point in its entirety but it makes the point that we have a low number of judges per head of the population compared with other countries with similar systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">Our judicial system has changed dramatically since the 1960s, to which Deputy Mitchell referred, and this is reflected across the legal profession. When I joined the Law Library in the 1970s there were, I imagine, approximately 380 barristers. There are now three or four times that number. Penniless barristers abounded in those days as much as they do now so, presumably, the amount of legal work going on in the courts has expanded by the same extent as the number of barristers. Likewise, the size of the solicitors' profession has grown hugely since the 1970s and certainly since the 1960s, to which Deputy Mitchell latched on.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Law, itself, has become immensely more complicated. Far from creating a paperless society, electronic developments, photocopying and the like have made law immensely more complicated than it once was. The number of law books available now is exponentially larger than when I started practising law when there was a handful of Irish legal textbooks. A book shop, which sells law books relating to Ireland now has scores of books, and a number on any particular area. Things have changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Another aspect of law, which has changed since those days is the type of procedures which are deployed. When I was in the King's Inns as a student, discovery of documents was an extreme rarity. I imagine Deputy O'Keeffe would accept that in litigation in the 1970s the deployment of discovery was a rarity by comparison with the present. It was something which only Chancery lawyers ever talked about. It seemed to happen in will suits and the like but one did not hear much about it in any other context. Now, the whole litigation process is immensely more complicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">On top of that, the number of jurisdictions which have been created for the courts has increased hugely. The whole question of judicial review, which was then called State side has grown from something which was quite small to something which is very substantial. When I started practising at the Bar, State side, which is now judicial review, was regarded as an arcane subject which was confined to a minority of barristers and was not the most popular or profitable area of law in which to specialise. Now, virtually every aspect of our complex system of government is the subject, day in and day out, of challenges by way of judicial review not least, for instance, in the area of immigration law and asylum seeking where there is a small industry in challenging decisions and litigating cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I considered a number of facts, including the remarks made by Ms Justice Denham, whose judgment I respect and who is not profligate in demanding the appointment of more judges. I was faced with the situation that in the Special Criminal Court the waiting period of trial has grown to a very long period, that many senior members of the Judiciary were embarked upon tribunals of inquiry, which was a drain on the court's resources and that one member of the High Court has become, effectively, the Public Offices Commissioner on a full-time basis and is discharging that function. I know that most Deputies constantly receive representations from clients saying that to get their cases heard requires a considerable wait. I believe in the old maxim that justice delayed is justice denied. We must, therefore, ensure that people have a reasonable prospect of having their cases dealt with at an early date, whether the cases are commercial, personal, family, criminal, personal injury or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Deputy Mitchell may be arguing, by implication, that the systems in the Four Courts or in the Courts Service are unduly cumbersome or that the courts are inefficient in carrying out their work. Perhaps there is merit in that argument. The Courts Service is going to extraordinary lengths to modernise Irish law and to bring it from the 19th to the 21st century with only a passing acquaintance with the 20th century and to cope with the huge changes, which are happening in the way law is administered in a very short period of time. I have no doubt there are vast opportunities to improve the way our legal system works but there is a process and a climate of change.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">During the local elections I went to a house in what <i>The Star </i>would call the leafy suburb of Ranelagh, near enough to where I live. I encountered a member of the Law Library and I asked him to support our local election candidate.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">I was told — and I do not use the exact term used in reply — that I must be joking. When I raised an eyebrow I was informed that my party leader had already deprived the voter of 40% of his income. This arose from the fact that the personal injuries trade was disintegrating. I remarked that this was strange because the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was only starting and I was only getting the legislation through the Oireachtas. He said it was what I was threatening to do that was having such a dramatic effect on the personal injuries business. It is fascinating that this should be so. One hears much talk about vested interests and the like. When the Irish public hear of my struggles with prison officers regarding overtime, for example, I have no doubt that they would like to know that I suffered equally at the hands of such eminent people for treading on their financial toes in another respect.</p>

Many of these medical negligence cases are mixed cases where a traffic accident, for example, develops into a case about failure to get the bone to set in a broken leg.

          <speech by="#JoeCallananFF" eId="spk_314">
            <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
            <p eId="para_813">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. Disabled person's grants are given to adapt a house to suit the needs of a disabled person by building a downstairs bedroom and bathroom or other adjustments so the disabled person may continue to live in his or her house. It is Government policy to retain the disabled and elderly in their homes rather than in institutional care. The provision of a disabled person's grant or essential repairs grants is part of the policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">I have personal experience of what it means to a person who cannot climb the stairs, to get a disabled person's grant to build a downstairs bedroom en suite. It gives the person a new lease of life. The elderly are also delighted when repairs are carried out to a roof or when new doors and windows are installed under the essential repairs or housing for the elderly grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The level of funding by the Government has increased from €18.6 million in 1999 to €65 million in 2004. The disabled person's grant has been increased from more than €10,000 to €20,000, and provides for a 90% grant. The essential repairs grant has been increased from €1,144 to €9,523. The Government provides two thirds of the cost and the county council provides one third. Providing one third of the cost of the grant was and still is a major problem for local authorities, but thanks to the decision of the Minister to allow the balance to be funded from internal receipts from the sale of council houses, which was approved by the Department in November 2003, it has become easier for councils to fund their share.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">The disabled person's and essential repairs grants are a major success. The number of applications has increased considerably in the past number of years, leaving a large number of unapproved applications. Councils now seek a certificate from a medical practitioner to define the level of dependency so the application may be prioritised. Where the applicant is in the category of full dependency there is no delay, otherwise the delay may be up to ten months, which is unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">The percentage level of the grant being paid by Galway County Council is far short of 90% and I will give examples. A grant of €6,000 was paid for an en suite bedroom extension; a grant of €2,600 was paid to convert a room to a bathroom; a grant of 50% of the cost, or €1,500, was paid to install central heating; a grant of €4,000 was paid to provide a bedroom extension or stairlift or bathroom; a grant of €1,400 was paid to provide a walk-in shower; and a grant of €800 was paid to provide ramps and handrails.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">Many disabled persons are no longer able to avail of the disabled person's grant due to the difference between the overall cost of the work and the level of grant paid. I was disappointed by the statistics provided by Galway County Council which shows a decrease in grants from €215,000 in 2002 to €127,000 in 2003 and also a reduction in essential repairs grants from €185,000 to €110.000. I have full confidence this Minister will ensure that the disabled person's grant and essential repairs grant will continue to give a new lease of life to people who need it.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">I acknowledge the co-operation of the health board and Galway County Council in the administration of the disabled person's grant, the essential repairs grant and the housing aid for the elderly grant. This co-operation has given a better deal for all applicants. Another area that should be examined is the requirement for a C2 certificate from employers for small jobs at low cost. In some cases it is difficult to get a contractor to do small jobs. I encourage the Minister to provide extra moneys in this year's budget to continue the great work done under these schemes and to ensure that a once-off grant could be given to those people who have to make many applications so that their applications are dealt with more speedily.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnCreganFF" eId="spk_315">
            <from>Mr. Cregan</from>
            <p eId="para_820">I am grateful for the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate. The demand under this scheme has grown very significantly in recent years. The regulations governing the scheme provide that a housing authority may pay a grant to provide additional accommodation or carry out works of adaptation that in the opinion of the authority are reasonably necessary for the purpose of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation of a member of a household who is either physically handicapped and the works are necessary for his or her proper accommodation or suffering from severe mental handicap. A physical disability is very obvious and readily seen but for too many years, local authorities did not recognise the need to look after people with mental disability. That has now been recognised and it is a very important development.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">The scheme is quite flexible and that is to be welcomed. The regulations are loosely framed to allow authorities to deal with applications in a flexible manner. To open the grant to as many applicants as possible and to provide a service, which the local authority feels is appropriate in its own area has been one of the strengths of the scheme. However, it makes it more difficult to manage and to ensure that the available funding is directed to those who need most assistance on mobility and income grounds. The more flexible the scheme, the more applications will be received.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">The huge increase in demand for assistance under the disabled person's grant can be attributed to the improvements the Government has made to the scheme over the past five years. The maximum grant has been doubled from €10,158 to €20,320. The percentage of grant available has increased from 75% to 90% of the approved cost of works and level of recoupment at local county level has increased from 50% to two thirds. It is very important that the grant has increased because in many cases, applicants were unable to pay the 25% whereas in most cases, they are able to pay 10%.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">I will quote figures from my own county. In 1998, Limerick Country Council administered 93 grants in total, spending €340,799. In 2003, it administered 187 grant applications, spending a total of €928,000. I am proud that my county can meet demand and can approve all applications, which fit the criteria and pay all grants on time.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">At a recent Oireachtas joint committee meeting, Deputy Allen stated that Cork Corporation refused to pay a grant to an amputee. I thought that was a shameful reflection not on the Government but on the members of Cork Corporation. It is important to obtain maximum funding from the Exchequer for all types of grants but it is equally important to ensure that local authorities acknowledge the local contribution necessary at Estimates time. If we feel strongly enough about the disabled person's grant and essential repairs grant, we must put our money where our mouth is at Estimates time. The issue should be discussed with the housing officers and directors of service. They should be asked for their estimation of the demand over the next 12 months and that price should be delivered in the Estimates. That is the only way demand can be met. I am not having a go at the Opposition when I say it is shameful — many of own colleagues have been in control of county councils and corporations throughout the country — that county councils and corporations have failed to bring in a proper Estimate to ensure the necessary contribution is there from local funding to ensure we can meet demand for the grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">The available funding of €65 million for expansion in 2004 was notified to local authorities on 20 May 2004. Local authorities were advised to notify the Department if their allocation was either inadequate or surplus to their requirements in order to facilitate the reallocation of funds to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. A small number of local authorities have indicated they will seek increased funding. If funding is so scarce and is seen to be so inadequate, why have not more local authorities notified the Minister and sought more funding?</p>

            <p eId="para_829">Unit costs, which are very important was mentioned. Limerick County Council revised its unit costs recently in line with inflation and to ensure the grants offered are within reach of the estimates from builders. I take the point made by my colleague, DeputyCallanan, with regard to C2s requiring to be presented in all cases. That is difficult. In some cases, builders or developers are not willing to carry out small works. They prefer to work on bigger jobs and tend not to accept smaller jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">The housing aid for the elderly scheme is excellent. It provides for the installation of heating for elderly people. This is necessary. It is no longer considered a luxury. There are three schemes, the special housing aid for the elderly, the disabled person's grant and essential repairs grant. These schemes are being reviewed by the Minister and the Department which is to be welcomed. In some cases there is duplication and triplication and in other cases people fall between stools and do not qualify for any one scheme. It is very important to work out something so that all grant applicants can be facilitated.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">With regard to the special housing aid for the elderly I mention the people on community employment schemes who are providing this service. When applying for a disabled person's grant people are obliged to get an estimate from a contractor, but with regard to the housing aid for the elderly scheme, there are people who will do the work for the applicant. I compliment FÁS for its valuable work. I support the amendment. I encourage an increase in funding. My appeal is to my local authority colleagues to ensure they make every effort to prioritise their funding. Our elderly people should be a priority. We have an ageing population and more funding will be required. We must put our money where our mouth is and ensure there is sufficient local contribution to match the Government funds.</p>

            <from>Mr. Nolan</from>
            <p eId="para_832">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. I commend the Opposition for tabling it. It is a subject that affects all local authorities and every Member of the House. In some way every public representative has come across the difficulties encountered by families who want to avail of disabled person's grant schemes in particular. Listening to the debate last night and tonight, there seems to be a divergence among Members of the House as to the success or otherwise of this scheme. Some counties, as has been pointed out by Deputy Cregan, seem to have a better grip of the situation than others.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">I can speak only for my own county of Carlow. We certainly have difficulties in respect of the funding aspect of this scheme. We are prepared to put up our one third and have done so over several years. The councillors are prepared to provide the one third which is necessary for this scheme on an annual basis when the rates are being debated. There has been a demand for this scheme because of its success and this demand far outstrips the supply. The success of the economy and the inflation costs in building have contributed to the cost of small alterations and some alterations are on a bigger scale and the moneys do not cover such work. Individual cases where work has to be carried out without prior applications being made is one aspect I ask the Minister and the Department to examine.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">I am aware of a number of cases of individuals who had accidents or strokes or experienced major health problems and required immediate alterations to their homes, for example, the provision of a downstairs bathroom, temporary downstairs bedroom or, in one case of a mother confined to a wheelchair, the widening of doors and fitting of new doors. Unfortunately, as the people in question were returning home from hospital, they did not have time to go through the long process of making an application, having it assessed and awaiting a decision. In the case of the woman confined to a wheelchair, her family went ahead and made alterations, for which I cannot blame them, only to find that by doing so they had debarred themselves from the scheme. Although the scheme is relatively flexible, health boards and housing officers in local authorities should be allowed more discretion in assessing cases where there appears to be genuine hardship.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">I encourage the Minister to provide more funding for the disabled person's grant scheme. While it has increased substantially in the past four or five years, it must be borne in mind that building inflation appears to be eating into the work that can be carried out for the sums involved. The scheme's flexibility should be extended to give greater power to housing officers to assess genuine cases in which decisions must be made relatively quickly to accommodate the needs of the families of individuals. As I stated, difficulties have arisen in circumstances where members of families have suffered strokes and major alterations have become necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">Another problem arises in various local authority housing estates in which the first floor of two storey houses is not used by the occupants. This occurs mainly in the cases of elderly people who cannot use the staircase and have a downstairs bedroom. This accommodation could satisfy the needs of families living in overcrowded conditions. I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of addressing the problem of overcrowding by arranging to swap housing stock not being used to its full potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">I support the Government's efforts in the area of disabled person's and essential repairs grants. I ask it to bear in mind, however, that building inflation is such that more and more funding is needed for the schemes.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnMoloney" eId="spk_321">
            <from>Mr. Moloney</from>
            <p eId="para_838">The debate on this important motion offers a genuine opportunity to improve the disabled person's grant scheme, rather than a political weapon to embarrass the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">As regards possible improvements to the scheme, I have often come across applicants who have a difficulty with its name. I suggest the Department consider renaming it the disabled person's grant-independent living grant scheme to facilitate fair minded people who would have difficulty applying for a grant because they do not believe they are fully disabled.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">I have been impressed by the figures rolled out this evening and do not propose to go over them again, except to note that the €1.8 billion to be allocated in 2004 across the range of programmes must be welcomed.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">I was a member of a local authority for 24 years until six months ago. The issues facing local authority members in the early 1980s were lights, roads and other matters affecting the public at large. I am pleased to note that local authorities' estimates in recent years have been primarily concerned with finding funding to improve the living conditions of people with disabilities, which is a major step forward. I also compliment those local authorities that have sourced sufficient funding from their own resources to ensure that the maximum grant aid was available to cover disabled person's grant applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">While the allocation increases each year, the number of people applying for the grant is also increasing. People can avail of the grant to increase their mobility in the home. We have spoken at length in various debates on health about the importance of ensuring people can live in their own homes for as long as possible. It is important we promote that policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">I will outline the areas in which the scheme can be improved. While people often complain about the notion of means testing, I would welcome a means tested grant if it ensured that people with more severe disabilities would be given preference over persons with less severe disabilities and a greater income. I am not trying to create difficulties as one of the reasons I admire the scheme is that red tape is minimal. Those whose main difficulty is mobility or disability should be prioritised. Given that the number of applications will always increase, irrespective of the level of funding allocated each year, we should prioritise those most in need. As regards the level at which a means test should be set, I suggest that a figure above the ceiling for a local authority reconstruction loan would be appropriate. Despite proposing that the merits of a means test be considered, my preference is that the maximum possible number of people with disabilities benefit from the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">Deputies have referred to the problems elderly persons face in trying to secure a contractor. I have encountered many cases in my local authority where those awarded grants towards the end of a given year could not find a contractor. A roll-over programme should be introduced to address such cases. In other words, if a local authority is satisfied that all genuine attempts have been made to secure a contractor but have failed, the funding should not be returned to the Department but held by the local authority for at least a year to allow the applicant to find a contractor.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">While I welcome the fact that local authority occupants receive 100% grants, I have often found that home owners, who receive 90% funding, face equally difficult circumstances because they may be in receipt of a widow's pension or old age pension. The stringent criteria applicable in such circumstances should be lifted.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">To try to maximise the level of funding available and ensure it is spread as evenly as possible, and to involve as many applicants as possible, we must examine the possibility of introducing a claw-back mechanism. As regards grants for what are known as granny flats, for example, while I am aware that local authorities cannot determine the longevity of applicants, it should be possible to insert a stipulation that, in the event of the applicant ceasing to live in the accommodation or moving to a nursing home within a period of perhaps two or three years — I do not want to raise the prospect of the applicant dying — the grant, or at least a percentage of it, would be clawed back.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">I will now focus on the role of local authority members. New local authorities have been established throughout the State. My local authority in County Laois found €800,000 for the disabled person's grant scheme from its own resources in last year's estimates. It is always easy to complain about Government action or lack of it, but any independent observer examining the allocations for this year and the past ten years would have to conclude that the Government is serious about the disabled person's grants. The focus should now move back to local authority members. I suggest that if the disabled person's grant scheme is a priority, local authority members must ensure they deal with their lists of applications because it is in their interests that applicants are provided for.</p>

          <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_322">
            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_848">I wish to share time with Deputies Ó Caoláin, Finian McGrath, Cowley and Connolly.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">I thank the Labour Party for tabling the motion as it allows Members to express their continuing frustration and dissatisfaction with the application and consistency of the disabled person's grant scheme. The debate also allows the Government to account for its stewardship of a scheme which has significant potential and has been of benefit but which is proving more of a hindrance than a help to people with disabilities in meeting and improving their accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">Part of the problem lies in the lack of consistency in the application of the scheme, which is a national problem. The Government has failed to define criteria on how the scheme should be applied from area to area. For instance, there is still too much onus on the disabled person or his or her family to do the running in making sure the grant is sought. They must provide medical reports from health board workers, housing suitability reports, engage a contractor and make sure he or she has a C2 certificate. A properly-developed scheme would provide a list of approved contractors in each local authority area. As a consequence, there would be less onus on the disabled person or his or her family to do such leg work and it would be easier to access the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">Ultimately, the problem with the scheme nationally is it is demand-led rather than needs-led. It is similar to the higher education grants scheme, which is also administered by local authorities at a considerable cost to them. A person who receives a higher education grant must meet educational and means criteria. The amount guaranteed by the Government is a multiple of the number who meet the criteria. That is not the case with the disabled person's grant. Until that scheme becomes needs-led, local authorities will only be able to provide so much in each financial year due to their funding difficulties. The farcical position currently is that they can run out of money for the scheme three months into a fiscal year. It is not acceptable that approval for the grant is based on change and that is, ultimately, the responsibility of the Government. That is why I am glad the motion has been tabled.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">Another difficulty relating to the scheme is the introduction of rules on a local basis. Deputy Allen has previously raised the case of an amputee in Cork whose grant application was refused. I have come across cases where a person was entitled to the grant on the basis of his or her disability or means but because he or she defaulted on local authority service charges, rent or commercial rates, funding under the scheme was withheld. A local authority official makes a determination in such cases for the sake of petty points scoring while the needs of a person with a disability are not met. This is the result of the Government's failure to lay down proper criteria. I would like a better response from Government Members to the debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">I agree the amount of the grant needs to be re-assessed. The scale of the redevelopment of houses must be taken into account. Cases may involved a bathroom renovation while others may involve significant room extensions. The economies of scale are high and, therefore, the capital and building costs are proportionately high. The grant scheme should reflect that because it does not do so currently. It is ironic that tax breaks are given to builders undertaking large-scale developments that can be built quite easily, yet the Government is not prepared to target investment at small-scale building redevelopment to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The Government is not prepared to put in the effort or demonstrate the leadership needed.</p>

            <p eId="para_855">On behalf of Sinn Féin, I fully support the Labour Party motion. Reform of the disabled person's housing grant scheme is long overdue. This should include both increased provision for those in need of the grant and an improvement and standardisation of its delivery across the State. Every Member can testify to the problems caused by the way the current grant scheme is rolled out. There is inconsistency and unfairness, as local authorities administer the scheme differently.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">Spinal Injuries Ireland, which represents people who have suffered spinal injury and who are disabled, recently published a comprehensive survey and report which deserves praise. It shows that 45% of those surveyed experienced difficulty in acquiring the disabled person's grant. Approximately 74% of respondents had to make adaptations to their homes as a result of their disability. There is, therefore, a major problem. The report indicates the grant has become more difficult to access in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">There is no excuse for this and we should not have to wait for the outcome of yet another departmental review, as mentioned in the Government amendment. I again refer the Minister to the report from Spinal Injuries Ireland. It sets out best practice relating to the operation of the scheme by one local authority and urges that this should be adopted on a State-wide basis. Time does not allow me to go into detail. Suffice to say it is not rocket science and it could be easily applied by all local authorities. Political will at national level is required first. This should be done and the grant should be put on a statutory basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">The Disability Federation of Ireland is also to be commended for setting out the accommodation needs of people with disabilities in its programme for local government published before the elections entitled Housing — the Vital Element. My party endorsed that programme and in our manifesto we committed ourselves to campaign for the Government and the local authorities to develop a State-wide accommodation strategy for people with disabilities; all local authorities to have a dedicated access officer employed to inspect planning applications to ensure accessibility; all local authorities to work with voluntary and State agencies to develop and implement an appropriate accommodation strategy for people who experience mental illness and for the young chronic sick; and the disabled person's housing grant to cover 100% of the cost of building work and standard qualification criteria to apply throughout the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">We can campaign for these measures but as long as we are on these benches only the Deputies opposite can deliver them. The Government has tabled its customary self-congratulatory amendment. People with disabilities and a wide cross-section of opinion acknowledge that progress has been made. However, there is a long way to go and it should never be forgotten that every advance came about not as a result of vision and commitment on the part of successive Governments because this was absent, but as a result of the earnest campaigning, lobbying and protesting by people with disabilities. It is time we faced up to our responsibilities. I endorse the motion and commend it to the Government.</p>

            <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_860">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the motion which seeks proper funding for the disabled person's grant scheme and raises the urgent need to increase the maximum payable under the scheme to at least €30,000. I support the motion. It is a disgrace that, once again, people with disabilities are on a waiting list. This demonstrates clearly the type of Government we have and its priorities. It also demonstrates the need for a radical change in society. It is no longer a debate about lack of resources but about the way the Government distributes those resources. Even if the Government lacks the bottle to pay for services for those with disabilities, it could still provide funding for quality services on the ground. Last week alone we saw €47 million collected from tax defaulters, while €52 million was spent in the electronic voting fiasco and €15 million was spent on Punchestown. I urge the Minister to consider these real issues. The Government seems to put horses before people. That is the reality for those with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">We have patients on hospital trolleys and 3,000 people with intellectual disabilities seeking respite, day care and residential places. There are homeless people on the streets and young couples cannot afford to buy a house in this city. This is a wealthy society and a booming economy but people are sick and tired of waste and inefficiency in the State. The Government can rush through a referendum in 60 days or a State Airports Bill in a few weeks, yet we are still waiting for a disability Bill which will give rights and services to people. That shows the Government's priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">Today I visited a school for children with disabilities, Enable Ireland in Sandymount, where the Minister for Education and Science is refusing to grant €5,000 to fund the July programme for children with multiple disabilities, and 15 students will now be locked out of the July programme. Those children and their parents are devastated. This is a shame. I received a letter from one of those parents, the mother of a severely disabled child, which states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_863">I am the mother of a child with a brain injury. I think even the Department of Education could understand why these students need this camp. In fact, I would go so far as to say that they should have all-year-round schooling. I will go into my own overdraft to pay €5,000 to Brendan Hennigan [the principal] for this year's summer camp costs if you will give an undertaking that I will get refunded by the Department of Education in the autumn. I am not an angry person. I am sad that Ireland has turned her back on our children.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">This is the reality for people with disabilities. The school was short €5,000 and last week the Government had €47 million coming in. I urge the Minister and the Government to take their heads out of the sand and to support these children and their parents. I urge all Deputies to support this motion, which is about people, justice and equality. Above all, it is about delivering services for all people with disabilities and I urge all Members to support it.</p>

            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_865">In supporting this motion I cite a submission to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. Published in 1996 and entitled A Strategy for Equality, it states that people with disabilities do not want to be pitied, nor do they want their disabilities to be dismissed as of little importance. All that is required is a little respect and basic needs and rights. Surely that is not too much to ask.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">That is the question and I wonder about this history of neglect when it comes to disability. Fianna Fáil has great empathy with this motion but when it comes to voting that is another matter. The problem is that money is provided for these schemes but it is not enough. If it can be proven that a person with a disability has a need, why not provide the essential funds to allow that need to be fulfilled? We hear a lot about independent living and community care being the best option, but that is lip-service being paid to those with disabilities. This is a case where the Government should put its money where its mouth is and increase the grant, which is not sufficient to cover increased building costs. The grant is potentially a very good one and has been important to many disabled people but it could achieve much more. For example, the process by which the grant is paid out needs to be streamlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">I was a member of an SPC in Mayo and I saw many applications from many disabled and elderly people seeking essential services, but the money was not there. Funding had run out and if more money came in it became necessary to prioritise allocations. Those applying were in great need and we were prioritising, but if one were a horse one would be better looked after. There was money for Punchestown and electronic voting but where is the money for those who deserve it? Where is the money to provide essential services which allow people to live independently in their own homes? This is a case of penny wise, pound foolish.</p>

            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_868">The original concept of the disabled person's housing grant scheme was one of the most progressive and far-reaching schemes ever devised to improve the lot of disabled persons. The grant was introduced to help disabled persons adapt their homes and to facilitate independent living. It covers 90% of the costs involved but is currently capped at €20,000. However, many of the grants are for amounts far lower than €20,000 and a lot of them are for less than €5,000. Unfortunately, many disabled persons are forced to go without essential facilities such as chair lifts or downstairs toilets due to cutbacks in the grant scheme which is administered by local authorities. The Government has failed to provide adequate resources for local authorities to adequately administer the scheme. County councils have been given a poisoned chalice in that they must say "No", which is grossly unfair, and some of them have been forced to cancel the scheme altogether.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">The delay in allocating grants to people with disabilities to enable them to adapt their homes to meet their specific needs is a national scandal and is another example of the Government's callous indifference to the plight of disabled persons. Many wheelchair-bound persons have been waiting for over 20 months to have their homes adapted through the installation of ramps, the conversion of baths to showers or the provision of disabled person's toilets. Failure to complete such work invariably results in physically disabled persons having to remain in hospital for longer periods or being transferred to nursing homes at a cost of €2,000 per month to the State. This puts their next of kin and carers through torture night and day because they have neither the facilities they deserve nor the money to supplement the cost of the nursing home. This is grossly unfair on the carer who is left behind.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">Several people have died while waiting for the disabled person's maintenance grant to arrive to convert their homes. I wonder if this is part of the plan — that by waiting long enough the authorities know some of those who are greatly in need will pass on. It can be very distressing for the bereaved to receive notice of authorisation to proceed following the death of the disabled person. There is no doubt that the time spent processing the applications may exceed the time remaining for a terminally-ill person.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">The treatment of the disabled is sometimes an affront to those who want to live at home, with unnecessary delays caused by the assessment of applications. In some cases county councils want to assess an application but the local health board cannot provide occupational therapists to carry out those assessments. This can cause delays of over 18 months and sometimes a date cannot be given for an assessment. A blame game is going on here in that people apply to the county council and are told the matter is with the health board. That is buck-passing and is grossly unfair, as the person falling between two stools is the carer.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">I also wonder about the amounts being spent on assessments. An occupational therapist has to be paid to travel for the assessment and a doctor must also carry out an assessment. The amount of professional time eaten up like that can amount to 50% of the cost of the job. It should be possible for priority systems to be established which could expedite decisions and reduce red tape.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">The grant ceiling of €20,300 is no longer realistic and is inadequate for major structural alterations. I recommend that it is increased to at least €30,000. Adapting and altering houses for those with disabilities frequently improves their health and in many cases it utterly transforms their quality of life. There is no doubt about that. If people can be treated in their own homes they are far more satisfied; they improve and have a far better quality of life. People who were formally compelled to live in residential care are able to choose to live in their own homes. That is the way we should go.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_874">The disabled person's grant has helped many people with disabilities over the years to reach a very much, improved quality of life. Local authority tenants do not have to pay anything towards the cost of the work carried out while house owners pay 10% of the total cost. The maximum grant available under the disabled person's grant scheme is €20,320. This is certainly not enough for certain types of work. The Labour Party motion calls on the Government to increase the maximum amount payable under the scheme to at least €30,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">Another aspect of the €20,320 maximum grant payable under the disabled person's grant scheme is the case where a person with a disability needs to carry out further work having already claimed the grant. As it stands, the person cannot be paid more than an accumulated €20,320 for two or more applications. Raising the maximum grant to €30,000 would at least be an improvement on the above situation. However, where it is clearly demonstrable that a second or third application is justified, each application should be treated as a new one with the €30,000 maximum payable applying. Where a person experiences an unexpected and dramatic worsening of his or her disability, he or she should not be prevented from having the necessary and much-needed work carried out because he or she has previously availed of the grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">For a time, Waterford City Council approved the installation of central heating under the grant scheme but early in 2003, approval for applications relating to the installation of central heating was withdrawn in order to reduce the number of applications competing for approval from a limited fund. A disabled person who can deal with an open fire with difficulty, if at all, would find the installation of central heating an absolute godsend.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">In Waterford city and county, there is another factor which is causing long delays in the processing of applications, namely, the shortage of occupational therapists in the employment of the health board. The input of the occupational therapist is vital in maximising the benefit from the adaptation or extension to the house where a person with a disability resides. Sometimes small alterations to the work proposed can improve matters greatly for the disabled person. This is where the trained eye and expertise of the occupational therapist is vital. The urgency of providing an adequate number of occupational therapists in each health board area cannot be overstated. On the face of it, there is little room for optimism in the short term in this regard. What this deficit amounts to is that scarce resources are not being employed to the best effect. The situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">Special housing aid for the elderly is a scheme which assisted in carrying out vital and very important work on the homes of senior citizens. The maximum grant under this scheme is too low in the context of today's costs. The grant, a maximum of €2,540, is resulting in a significant drop in applications in my constituency. In regard to the disabled person's grant scheme and the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, an ongoing problem has been the difficulty in obtaining estimates from builders for the work to be carried out. To put it mildly, builders are not overwhelmingly interested in these small jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">These schemes are vital for senior citizens and people with a disability living an independent life with dignity in the community. Obviously, support services, such as those provided by public health nurses, home helps and home supports are vital, but if people are living in accommodation that is inadequate and unsuitable, the benefit of these services is undermined. The Government talks about a review of the disabled person's grant scheme being finalised by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The question must be asked about what exactly "finalised" means. Every day that passes is a day lost to many senior citizens and many people with a disability.</p>

            <from>Ms Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_880">I have listened to the debate over the past two days. I must admit that every speaker, both from the Government and the Opposition sides, had a firm grasp of what this debate is about. Equally, every speaker was genuinely concerned about the situation. However, all the speakers I heard, apart from Deputy O'Shea, because of his personal experience, have a difficulty understanding exactly how people with a disability manage. A disability could be short term but, nevertheless, people with a disability are not a separate species. One could be born with a disability or one could acquire one. Disability can come through illness, old age, stroke, heart attack, diabetes and so on. There is a big pool into which any of us at any stage could fall. When one has a disability, it knocks one's confidence but to be put into a category as if one is a different species is fundamentally wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">People with a disability can live perfectly normal lives but they need straightforward alterations to the structures in which they live. We can do virtually anything now. We like to tell ourselves that we can send people to the moon and find cures for new diseases so it should surely be within our ability to alter structures which we built in the first place to ensure people can live decent and respectable lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">All the speakers I heard tonight who were, in the main, from the Government side, spoke about the need to ensure people with a disability have the dignity of living at home without the indignity of having somebody wash them, stand behind them as they go up and down the stairs or assist them into the toilet. These are things we all take for granted and which we could not imagine anyone watch us do. However, people with a disability must endure that every day. They face not only a physical or a mental disability, but also the indignity of having to go through this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">Listening to the speakers tonight, one would say these are caring, compassionate people and that, after all, this is not a political issue, but it is. Not only is it a political issue but it was used as a political football in the city of Cork in 2002. This is a city that returned six out of ten Fianna Fáil Deputies. It is not as if Fianna Fáil looks after its own; it does not. People who reward Fianna Fáil are not necessarily rewarded in return. The Minister for Health and Children comes from Cork but we have an accident and emergency service which is creaking at the seams. It was like a scene from "M.A.S.H." last week. We do not have enough money to open the new accident and emergency service.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">In 2002, the year we were all elected to this House, 300 applications for the disability grant were dealt with in Cork. They were streamlined or fast-tracked. Those people, without let or hindrance, were dealt with in 2002. There was a different scenario in 2003 when everything slowed down and only seven applications were dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">In 2004, however, we have a waiting list of 200. This is in Steve Silvermint's constituency — the Minister, Deputy Martin's, turf. This is the man who is going to deliver to people with disabilities, yet 200 people are on the waiting list. Perhaps those 200 and the additional people who will go on to the list can wait until the next great splurge from the man himself in 2007, but I do not believe they can.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">I do not intend to talk about people with disabilities as if they were a separate species. I want to tell the House about Maura, a woman of about my age. She had a very happy marriage until her husband contracted multiple sclerosis. She says that she feels in her heart for him because if he wants to use the toilet, which is upstairs, she has to physically help him up every step. He is a big man who always looked after himself, but now she has to stand next to him while he uses the toilet, which is embarrassing for both of them. All it would take to solve the problem is the construction of a downstairs toilet, but that man will not get such a facility because there is not enough money.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">The Government side may be well-meaning but I cannot accept their argument that it is up to county councillors to ensure there is enough money for such facilities. It is up to the Government to make sure that sufficient funds are available. In Cork city the matter has become a political football and I pity the 200 people on the waiting list because they will have to wait until 2007 until the purse strings are reopened.</p>

            <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_888">This Labour Party motion is a positive one, whereas the Government's amendment is negative, talking only about something that happened in the past. We want to discuss what is happening now and what will happen in future. The processing of disabled person's grants, essential repair grants and housing aid for the elderly is appalling, yet the Government parties boast about how well the country is doing. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are out of touch. The elderly and disabled are forgotten. The delay in getting occupational therapists' reports, which are required for such grants, is deplorable. This is often the reason for the delay. Government representatives will know that some years ago such reports were not necessary because a doctor's recommendation was sufficient to qualify for a grant. I can see no reason that should not be the case still.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">The Labour Party's motion calls for sufficient funds to be provided by the Government and that the minimum payment should be €30,000 because building costs are higher now than they were last year or the preceding year. It is no excuse for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to say that they have increased the relevant amount over the years. The increasing percentage of elderly in our population is being ignored. It is appalling to see a Government allocating €15 million to Punchestown racecourse and spending over €50 million on electronic voting, while at the same time people cannot obtain necessary grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">Cork County Council has divided its grant allocation system into three priority levels, and grants were suspended in 2003. Despite the Government's commitment to local authorities that the rate support grant would be 100%, the Department has reduced it by more than a half. This is creating financial problems for local authorities in that they cannot offer the services they are obliged to provide. The hallmark of any civilised society is the manner in which it treats the elderly and the disabled. The Government is failing in this respect.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_330">
            <from>Mr. Allen</from>
            <p eId="para_891">This is the fourth Private Members' motion we have had in the past year or so dealing mainly with the issue of the disabled person's grant. Such motions were debated in the House in April 2003, July 2003 and May 2004. We are now debating a motion by the Labour Party on the same issue and it is an indication of how concerned Members are about what is happening in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">After I spoke on this issue the last time in the House, I wrote about it elsewhere. On that occasion, I referred to an 18 year old amputee who was refused a grant application for a walk-in shower. I put on the record my appreciation of a gesture made by a kind, elderly priest in Cork who made the necessary sum available to that family. The priest had very little money himself but was appalled by what was happening, given that the Government is flush with money and can throw it left, right and centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">It is a year tomorrow since the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, who is present, referred to the disabled person's grant. Responding to a Fine Gael Private Members' motion on housing, he stated: "We simply cannot continue with the level of increases in grants that have occurred — 3,000 grants in 1996, 6,300 in 2001 and 9,000 in 2002." He concluded by stating: "I am suggesting that local authorities should live within their means, act intelligently and budget their money over a period, instead of just spending and then wondering how they will cater for urgent needs." He spoke about local authorities whingeing and putting a millstone around their necks.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The Minister of State was reported as having said that the disabled person's grant was in need of reform because some counties approved too many grants, but what does he mean by this? Does he mean that some grants have been approved that should not have been? Does he think there should be a quota system in each county, which would mean that not everybody who needs a grant would get one, or is he saying that there are too many people with disabilities in each county, that they are a burden on the community at large and that, therefore, a quota system should be imposed on them? The Minister of State should clarify his careless talk on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">During the last Private Member's motion debate on persons with disabilities, an amendment tabled by the Minister's party and the Progressive Democrats boasted about increases in the disabled person's grant. In this debate, what one arm of the Government boasts about, the other says is unsustainable. The Minister of State should tell us what the hell is happening. This time last year, he said the system was under review and that an announcement would be made within a reasonable time. Twelve months later, however, we are still being told that the system is under review. Does that mean that disabled people who are dependent on these grants must wait indefinitely until the Minister of State gets his priorities right and focuses some money and resources on those who deserve them?</p>
            <p eId="para_896">The housing stock is largely inaccessible to people with disabilities. Looking around me, it is clear that this Chamber cannot be accessed by disabled people so it would be difficult for them to exercise their duties if they were required to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">The maximum adaptation grant is €20,000 but in reality people receive far less. Many people are condemned to hospitals or are stuck inappropriately in nursing homes, thus contributing to accommodation waiting lists. They may also be living in potentially dangerous homes, putting immeasurable strain on the individuals concerned and their families. The disintegration and dismantling of the disabled person's grant scheme cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">As has been said by other Deputies, there has been a great deal of pious talk in the House for the past two nights. People have been crying crocodile tears about the suffering of others. However, tonight presents an opportunity for those people to put their votes where their mouths are and support the Labour Party motion, which is worthy of such support from anyone with compassion or conviction in their veins.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">Last evening, my colleague detailed the commitment the Government has made in regard to the disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes in recent years, which has shown itself both in terms of the expansion of the terms of the schemes and the level of funding made available to finance them.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">Although I hate citing statistics, it is important to place the various contributions of Deputies in perspective. The number of applications to local authorities for assistance under the two schemes has more than doubled in the five-year period between 1998 and 2002, from approximately 6,500 to nearly 17,000. Some Deputies referred to cutbacks but there has been no such thing.</p>

            <p eId="para_902">Demand for the schemes has rocketed. Allied to the increased amount of grants available and the higher percentage of work payable, it was obvious this would put severe pressure on the schemes and the Government has moved to cater for that situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_904">No one can deny that not only has the funding increased but the absolute number of grants paid has risen significantly. Five years ago, the Government paid out approximately 3,800 grants at a cost of €18 million, whereas last year, the figure had risen to 8,500 grants in a four or five-year period. In money terms, the amounts rose from €18 million to €64 million. Money can often be misleading but by any standards the increase in the number of jobs undertaken from 3,800 to 8,500 represents a significant amount of work in a short period of time. It means that approximately 54,000 people in the past four or five years have had work done, which has allowed them to live in better comfort and enjoy a better quality of life.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">I was in the Seanad last night and did not hear the debate in this House but I heard of the many genuine cases which Members raised and I can understand them because we have all come across such cases. However, in regard to Deputy Allen's comments, it is important to point out that significant resources are going into these schemes and different local authorities spend different amounts. Some seem to manage what they get far better than others. The local authorities, which spend the most are not necessarily those which do not experience trouble. The review will examine the medical needs assessment.</p>

            <p eId="para_932">It is with great regret that I have listened to the Minister of State try to cast blame and doubt over the integrity of local authority officials who administer this scheme. In Kildare, we have some of the best officials of any county in Ireland and I regret that the Minister of State is trying to cast doubts over their ability to carry out this work. I also regret his use of statistics in order to avoid carrying out the work. This is a sad reflection on a Minister of State who has failed miserably in his attempts to get money invested in this scheme to allow ordinary people suffering from disabilities to have as normal a life as possible if their families are eligible to receive the grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">However, sadly, local authority officials against their better judgment must now put in place conditions to prevent people getting the disability grant. Officials now have to draw up conditions A, B and C for people to qualify for a disabled person's grant, just like those for orthodontic treatment. In the latter case, a person in class A has a chance of receiving such treatment; in class B might receive it in two years' time; and in class C would probably be in his or her grave before receiving it. Even worse is the disabled person's scheme, as adopted by the local authorities, because it means people in class A have a possibility of receiving a grant, while people in classes B and C have no possibility of receiving it.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The Minister of State has suggested that local authority officials are taking it for granted and are perhaps pleased they do not have to carry out the work in respect of adopting the system.</p>

          <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_364">
            <from>Mr. Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_936">What the Minister of State has said is an absolute disgrace. I hope he reflects on what he said in the House and perhaps he will withdraw it tomorrow. Local authority officials have no credence in what he said. Last night, I listened to the contribution of my constituency colleague, Deputy Seán Power. He spoke with great sense in regard to the Labour Party motion because he knows what has happened. He knows the problems he and I have encountered in Kildare. A total of 180 cases were sent back to the health board to be prioritised. When they came back just a handful were granted the money because of lack of funding. The money was not there despite what the Minister of State tries to suggest and the blame he has tried to cast on others.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">Only a small number of disabled person's grants have been allowed in Kildare this year. The applications sat there for at least six months while the health board tried to prioritise them. Yet all of the applicants who waited were suffering. This was not a case of having to prioritise since all the grants had been recommended by the occupational therapist. When it came down to the wire the local authority did not have the money as the Department had refused to give it. Now we have the unfortunate development of A, B and C categories in Kildare County Council and probably in every other local authority. Those in the B and C categories have no hope this year or in the foreseeable future of receiving any assistance under this grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">I will not put any more cases on the record. Every Deputy who has contributed, from whatever side, has outlined cases in their own areas. Another case will neither strengthen nor weaken the case. That the Minister of State tries to pass the blame to the local authority shows his lack of credibility. He should have admitted he had failed and failed miserably to obtain the necessary funding for local authorities to ensure that persons suffering from a disability could receive the grant which was recommended by the occupational therapist to enable them enjoy life.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">There is a problem also in regard to housing aid for the elderly. Occupational therapists have said they will not take the rap for the local authorities. The local authority will deal only with matters that do not relate to an occupational therapist's report. There was a time when if an occupational therapist's report was submitted it to the health board the funding would be provided. That is not the case now. That compounds the problem for the local authority as it cannot reduce the waiting lists for disability grants. The health board will do only small works and nothing associated with a possible insurance claim. It will not change a bath to a shower facility for an elderly person unless that person signs a document saying he or she will not take legal action against the health board. All those unfortunate people will suffer because of the approach of the health board.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">The Minister of State has failed miserably. It is his duty, having listened to both sides of the House, to go back to the Minister for Finance and tell him of the need for extra funding to meet the demands of all local authorities. If he does that he will have done a good day's work.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_365">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_941">I thank Deputies on all sides who contributed to the debate on an issue that is of the utmost importance to those who must rely on the disabled persons grant scheme to undertake improvements or adjustments to their homes and to live with a modicum of dignity in their community. The debate was characterised by a number of thoughtful contributions from both sides of the House. That is because Members on all sides recognise the genuine concern about the shocking situation in regard to the disabled persons grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">Deputy Wall has commented on the contribution last night by his constituency colleague, Deputy Power. I pay tribute to the remarks of Deputy Power because week after week, Government Deputies come in to defend the impossible on Private Members' business and to assert the Government line that everything is rosy in the world of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. It is seldom that Government backbenchers contribute to a Private Members' debate in the honest way that Deputy Power did last night. It was one of those rare occasions. As Deputy Wall has said, it is because he recognises the crisis out there. He dealt honestly with the position in his constituency and pointed out that Kildare County Council would have less than €1 million this year for the scheme, compared to €1.6 million last year. He stated: "... with some shame I have to say that no grants have been paid in Kildare at all in 2004, though we are almost halfway through the year..." He went on to say, "A country can be judged on the way it looks after its citizens who cannot look after themselves". He stated further: "In private, few Members of the House would disagree with the motion before us". That is the truth for many Government backbenchers.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">I heard my colleague, Deputy O'Connor, agree with the motion and the Government amendment. It was a grand motion and a lovely amendment. Other than that most Members recognise that the motion, tabled by Deputy Gilmore, is the truth of what we all encountered on the doors during the recent elections and in our constituencies every week of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">This was the first opportunity for the new caring face of Fianna Fáil to manifest itself. We have heard speeches about the social democratic wing, the caring disposition that was the true Fianna Fáil tradition, yet we had a speech from the Minister that would do any Progressive Democrats member proud. I listened this evening to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on television saying he is worn out with Ministers crying and whingeing. He tells them they are the Government and if they do not like it, change it. He told them not to pester him about it, to go out and change it. He said that if they do not like the quango, the authority or the local authority, they are the Government and have absolute power to go out and change it. We have a perfect example tonight of what the Minster for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has to put up with, a Minister of State who is prepared to blame everyone, except himself, for the fact that the scheme has run into trouble. In respect of the manner in which it is manipulated, in Cork last year seven applications were approved. In the previous year which was an election year there were 300 applications were approved. That is disgraceful, blatant, manifest manipulation of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">In proposing the motion last night, DeputyGilmore said the Exchequer returns for the first five months of the year show €632 million in revenue above the budget. What he did not say was that spending is €716 million less than provided for. The spend is down as compared to budget by €716 million. It is not just that the revenue is coming in at a level which was not anticipated, and not for the first time, but there is a deliberate contrived slow down of spend by €716 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">Deputy Wall said there is no point in putting another case on the record. Since my friend Deputy O'Connor said his county is doing quite well he obviously has a route in that I do not have. I will have a word with him after this debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">I give the House the example of a woman called Brigid from my constituency who first approached me about the disabled person's grant three years ago. She had to climb stairs to reach the toilet and go to bed. The council lost the Estimates and is now concerned about the issue. The woman is dying in St. James's Hospital and, because we have told the council this, someone will be sent to inspect the house. Her brother fought in 1916 and she herself was peripherally involved. She rarely used her medical card as she did not believe in being a burden on the State due to the way she was reared. For three years there was no response from the local authority until it became common knowledge that the woman was dying in St. James's Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">This an example, of the kind of extremes to which local authorities are forced to go because they do not have the money they need. The Minster says they should manage better, which some do, but it is impossible to manage if the money is not available. All his suggestion advances is the argument in favour of a national scheme underpinned by statute, which can be implemented uniformly and fairly. Implementation will not be fair and uniform as long as local authorities must produce one third of the grant. Some can and some cannot while the need continues to build in the community. Despite the desperate need of people in some of the cases, which the Minister of State agrees we have all encountered, we can forgo millions of euro to give investors breaks to buy holiday cottages. While we have no difficulty with that, we cannot provide the basic wherewithal for people who have been waiting for years for the enactment of disabled persons legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">As I do not wish to make political capital out of the fact that Fianna Fáil backbenchers supported Deputy Gilmore's motion, I conclude by hoping they will speak in private with the Minister. While they will not vote with us tonight, it was clear from their speeches that they supported the content of the motion. If the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, belongs to the social-democratic wing of the Government, it was, regrettably, in scant evidence in the debate.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_1065">Amendment No. 24 in my name is designed to ensure that landlords are not in a position to rent out hovels. There is much evidence of this happening in the area of the country I represent. I have met many constituents who have raised this issue. Some of them have children and have informed me that they must use an outside toilet in their rented dwellings which are damp, whose windows are decaying and for which they pay a great deal every week. They need local authority accommodation urgently because their children's health is at risk but they have been on the public housing waiting list for up to four years. This problem concerns a minority of landlords. How can landlords get away with providing such living conditions in which people are forced to live and for which they must pay high rents?</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">We are supposed to have a system of registration of landlords with local authorities which are supposed to ensure that registration takes place of all rented properties but are failing in their duties in this regard. The 2002 census figures show that less than 25% of all rented dwellings are registered with local authorities. The Minister of State suggests that registration should take place centrally. It would be much more effective if local authorities were given the necessary resources to carry out enforcement of such registration in an effective way. They should ensure in the case of registration that an inspection of the premises takes place. Surely inspections should take place when an application is made for housing. An inspection should take place in all cases to access the applicant's housing needs. When such an assessment takes place, it seems a blind eye is turned to the conditions under which the applicant is living. I do not foresee local authorities living up to their responsibilities, even where an inspection takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">This amendment is tabled to introduce some control into the quality of accommodation being offered to some unfortunate people. This problem relates to a minority of irresponsible landlords, and such irresponsibility is being allowed to continue without any check by local authorities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_369">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1068">I want to speak to amendment No. 22 and I support amendments Nos. 21 and 24. On some local authority housing schemes speculators or investors will buy properties which adjoin the homes of people who have purchased local houses under the local authority tenant purchase scheme. The difference in two such homes after a few months, much less a few years, becomes evident. The house bought by a speculator quickly becomes extremely dilapidated. One can tell that the edifice of the house has not seen a lick of paint in some cases for more than ten years, drain pipes are hanging off walls and the boundary fences are in bits. The hearts of the unfortunate people who purchased homes adjoining such property are scalded trying to maintain their property and keep their little house looking "middling bright".</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The same situation occurs in private housing schemes where people pay exorbitant sums of money for what to them is a new home. Unfortunately an investor in the private rented market will buy a property and spend little or nothing on it for as long as 20 years while the poor unfortunate people next door put every effort into keeping their home by putting up new curtains and planting trees in the garden. We have canvassed constituents in these estates and know the situation. It is unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">Amendment No. 22 seeks to bring some level of accountability to bear on people who buy such properties as an investment. This is one of the themes that runs through a number of the amendments I have tabled. I very much consider a property to be a home as opposed to a commodity, whereas speculators and investors invest for a cold reason and laudably so in some cases, but they abandon their responsibilities to maintain the area and district to some semblance of a reasonable standard. If this amendment were accepted, it would allow some sanction to be imposed on such wayward landlords to try to bring them back into line. It is aimed at protecting those people who have made a significant investment in their homes or in maintaining them to a high standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">This problem is not unique to my constituency. No matter whether one travels around an urban estate in Dublin or estates in other towns or villages, one will note the same situation prevails. I hope some type of sanction can be brought to bear on these wayward landlords and that they might be obliged to maintain some level of a decent standard to the exterior as well as to the interior of these houses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_370">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_1072">I support DeputyMorgan's amendment No. 22. Over the past decade in particular an increasing number of properties in what were at one time council housing schemes, in more affordable private estates and in smaller townhouse and terrace developments in towns throughout this jurisdiction have been bought up by property speculators and by a new native landlord class or species who collect rents and do little or nothing else to maintain or promote the upkeep of their properties. I acknowledge that some act responsibly, but an increasing number of them ignore their responsibilities to their neighbours and others living in close proximity who have pride in their homes, the areas in which they live and their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">As Deputy Morgan said, one could visit these estates, as we all have done when canvassing in the recent local and European elections, and nearly identify from the obvious state of neglect the status of a property. One could identify whether a property was owner-occupied or rented. The difference between the two is almost as stark as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">Such wilful neglect of property is not acceptable and should be open to legal challenge. I speak of the appearance of such properties, their upkeep in terms of their external presentation, their need of a coat of paint, the cleaning out of guttering and repair of dangling downpipes, and the keeping of the gardens and surrounds of these properties where grass is allowed to grow unattended, trees, bushes and hedges have grown out of control and the appearance is one of general untidiness. All of this seriously impacts on the quality of life of people in an area and on the general appearance of residential areas. There is no means or method of addressing or, more importantly, redressing this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">This Bill offers an opportunity in that regard. I appeal to the Minister of State to take on board the important arguments Deputy Morgan made in speaking to his amendment. He should take on board this problem and recognise that this Bill could be used as a vehicle through which this type of wilful neglect could be addressed. The view of those responsible is that it is only the euro and cent return on a weekly or monthly basis that matters and that they have no other responsibility or duty to the property or to the area in which it is located. It cannot be enforceable in terms of occupants. The responsibility must clearly lie with the owners of these properties, who are demonstrating what I correctly described as wilful neglect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">I am sure the Minister of State will have recognised this problem in his constituency and I hope that, having done so, he will join us in trying to devise a formula that will win redress and allow families who have made a key investment in the development, betterment and enhancement of the community and in improving the quality of life for themselves and their neighbours to be assisted in some way in combating this new urban scourge that has been visited on so many of the housing schemes, particularly those associated with houses in the more affordable bracket. I appeal to the Minister of State to recognise the common sense of the proposition before us and to adopt it.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1077">I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 21. Apart from the fact that the reference to standards is very vague, the amendment is unnecessary. I presume its intention is to insert a reference to statutory requirements relating to standards of private rented accommodation. These are adequately covered by the existing reference to obligations under any enactment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">The Deputy may have raised this issue on Committee Stage. An amendment was made on Committee Stage to ensure an appropriate linkage between a landlord's obligations regarding repairs etc. under section 12 of the Bill and the regulations relating to standards of private rented accommodation under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. I do not know if it fully covers the point the Deputy was making.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">Amendment 22 in the name of Deputy Morgan alludes to the landlord's duty to maintain the exterior of the dwelling so it will not become an eyesore. The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993 prescribe minimum physical standards of private rented accommodation, including maintenance of dwellings in good repair, and they require common areas, walls and fences to be kept in good condition. These regulations continue to apply to rented accommodation. In any event, it would not be appropriate to insert into legislation a provision requiring the maintenance of dwellings to a standard comparable with that of adjoining properties as the concept is too vague and capable of too great a variation. I understand where the Deputy is coming from but the language used is inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">I am a bit confused about what Deputy Morgan spoke about. As I understood it, he was talking about local authority estates where speculators were buying what were——</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1082">It could happen in the private housing sector but in local authority estates, certainly those in Dublin with which I am better acquainted, the local authorities are very fussy about letting somebody who is not prepared to live in a dwelling as his primary residence buy that dwelling, unless it was bought under a sale scheme 25 years ago. However, if it were bought in recent years, the local authority would have been very fussy about ensuring that whoever moved in was the owner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1084">Generally, if my house or the Deputy's house were in rag order and we were living in them, the relevant local authorities could do less in this case than if we were renting them. There are regulations, however imperfect, in existence and obviously more enforcement is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">On Deputy Allen's point, local authorities have not been very proactive in following up registrations. However, one can write to one's local authority and inform it that a certain house is, in one's opinion, rented and that the gardens are in bad order, and one can inquire whether that house is registered and ask that something be done about it. If the house is in private ownership, lived in by a family, there is very little the authority can do. However, if it is a rented house that ought to be registered, regulations exist to allow the authority to follow up and do something about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1111">It is probably the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, which I referred to in respect of amendment No. 22. They outline the standards and it is to these I referred when speaking to Deputy Cuffe. I accept that enforcement is not carried out unless the local authorities receive complaints. However, the rules and regulations exist and what is needed is more enforcement. It is not necessary to have two statutory requirements stating the same thing. What we want — I agree with the Deputy in this regard — is better enforcement of existing provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">On amendments Nos. 26 and 27, I indicated on Committee Stage that I was disposed to accept the Opposition amendment to delete the reference to obligations being imposed by the board being consistent with the standards-regulations, subject to checking for legal implications etc. on the basis that there should be no question of the Private Residential Tenancies Board seeking to impose lower standards on private rented accommodation than are specified in regulations made under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. I am advised that there would be no legal implications and therefore amendment No. 27 deletes section 13(2)(<i>c</i>). It is accompanied by a consequential amendment, No. 26, which deletes the earlier reference. These points were made on Committee Stage and we said we would consider them and try to take them on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_1113">I will press my amendment because of the unsatisfactory situation which exists. It should be brought home forcefully to landlords that they have a responsibility to comply with building and environmental regulations and that dwellings must be in a state fit for human habitation. Until now, they have either been unaware of their obligations under building and environmental regulations or are choosing to ignore them because they know that local authorities are negligent, unwilling or do not have the resources to enforce the regulations. Landlords who read the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 and see that amendment No. 24 is included in the Bill will know their obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">Since the Minster of State is taking responsibility away from local authorities and giving it to the authority, what resources will the latter have to compile a national register and to inspect and monitor all rented properties? Is the Minister of State happy that it will do so adequately? More resources should be granted to the planning and enforcement sections of local authorities to carry out these functions rather than centralise them in a situation where the registration regulations will not be implemented. Will the Minister of State assure the House that the resources will be made available to do this major job of protection of tenants, which is a key element in the Bill?</p>

It would help if there was some enforcement of existing regulations and if local authorities had the resources to enforce them which, unfortunately, they do not. That responsibility does not rest on this side of the House. I hope the Minister of State will improve on that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">While I accept that the term "adjoining" may be a problem in amendment No. 22, the general thrust of the amendment could have been adopted and moulded by the Minister of State's officials, thus giving some sanction to local authorities. It is now nearly as cheap to buy a business as to buy a home. The price of homes is quickly heading towards half a million euro. People who commit themselves to such high levels of investment ought to be protected.</p>

          <p eId="para_1117">The Minister of State is right in what he says about the council housing schemes. I referred to one-time council housing schemes. Local authority houses which were bought under tenant purchase schemes over a period are being targeted along with more affordable private developments because they are within the reach of those who aspire to landlord success. Apart from the significant swathe of landlords who fail to live up to their responsibilities in terms of the upkeep of their properties, the existence of so many investors is putting these homes out of the reach of prospective home owner-occupiers, even couples with two incomes. Home buyers find that speculators are making the cost of homes prohibitive to many who view them as starter homes or as long-term homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">Apart from the deficiency in the construction of the amendment which the Minister of State has pointed out, I urge him to accept its spirit and to take a proactive approach in support of the thrust of Deputy Morgan's amendment, which is eminently sensible and will be warmly welcomed universally. I leave my appeal with the Minister of State and hope he will respond.</p>

One could say it would not be hard for it to do so because the previous system has not been a success. I believe the new system will work because while local authorities are good in many respects, they have a multiplicity of jobs to do and it is hard for them to concentrate on everything. We will have a board with a specific remit and specific functions to carry out and it will be much more focused on what it is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">The board will not take over all power. Local authorities will still have the job of following up and maintaining standards. The board will, in many cases, operate through local authorities, getting them to do inspections and field work.

          <p eId="para_1122">The existing regulations make local authorities responsible for standards. The board will operate through the local authorities. The board will not send inspectors to Cork or Donegal. It will operate through the relevant local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">I accept that much needs to be done with regard to standards. It is my intention to begin a programme to promote standards and to draw up best practice guidelines. I accept that enforcement has not been satisfactory and that we must be proactive in enforcement. When the legislation has been enacted it is intended to review the standard regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">The fundamental issue is one of supply and demand. The pressure that has been felt in all areas of the housing market, from private rented accommodation to the purchase of very expensive houses, has allowed some landlords to get away with murder. If the housing supply had been more plentiful, sub-standard houses would not have been let so easily. The best cure for poor standards is more supply of better quality houses. As more than 68,000 houses were built last year and a similar number will be built this year, the supply of houses will increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">We have all heard that rents, both in Dublin and elsewhere, have decreased from the all-time high of two years ago, although they are still very high. This decrease in rents is because the supply of houses has increased. This make us all a little more choosy and puts pressure on landlords who want to get a decent rent to provide accommodation of an acceptable standard. I intend to review the regulations but I feel that the extra supply in the market will make it more difficult to let bad accommodation. This will also exert a pressure on landlords.</p>

          <p eId="para_1129">I am happy to make one contribution but to double the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">There are two issues, first, the enforcement of standards in rented accommodation, where a tenant finds that the landlord is not looking after the property and the plumbing, electricity and water are not working and essential works that need to be carried out are not being done. Unfortunately, that is a regular feature of the private rented sector. I regularly come across examples of tenancies where the landlord is happy to take the rent and do absolutely nothing for it except bank it. The local authority is unwilling and in some cases unable to enforce the regulations as the property may not be registered. If the local authority takes the enforcement route, it ends up ultimately with an obligation to the tenant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">I remember a case in the middle of last winter when I stood in a flat which was absolutely freezing, as two of the windows were broken. It was a kip and the local authority had not condemned it and was reluctant to do so because if it did, it would have to provide housing for the tenants. There is a problem of enforcement. Under this legislation, the tenant has the right to go to the board and make a complaint and so on. There are flaws in the legislation, which I will outline when we come to deal with amendment No. 23 and related amendments. The issue of enforcement must be seriously addressed</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">The second issue was raised by Deputy Morgan who rightly outlined an issue with private rented dwellings. When one walks on to a road, one can tell immediately the dwellings that are rented. There is a problem with the maintenance of such dwelling, for example, cutting the grass and keeping the hedges trimmed. Incidentally, I see no reason that an able-bodied tenant should not be able to cut the grass if there is a lawnmower in the shed — let us not put all the responsibility on the landlord. The painting of the fascia and the deteriorating appearance of the dwelling is an issue. There is a provision in the Bill for people other than tenants to go to the board in certain circumstances, but it is very limited. It is somewhat flawed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">There is a wider issue that needs to be addressed and I would like to hear the views of the Minister on whether it should be addressed by separate legislation. There is a general problem. The Housing (Miscellaneous) Act introduced by my colleague, Deputy McManus, in the mid-1990s deals with anti-social behaviour, but only in respect of dwellings rented from a local authority. It does not apply to dwellings that have been purchased from a local authority, dwellings that are being rented privately or dwellings that are privately owned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">There is a neighbourhood problem, sometimes with the maintenance of the dwelling but also with the behaviour of the occupants of the dwelling who may not always be tenants. There is a need for legislation that will give neighbours a right to lodge complaints and have them addressed. A constituent told me a story of a neighbour who has a set on him and made his life hell. He makes noise in the middle of the night, knowing that the wife of my constituent is not well. He has created all kinds of difficulties for them and he gave me 12 pages of closely typed print documenting the hell that is being inflicted on him. There is nothing he can do. The Garda Síochána does not see it as the responsibility of the force to intervene in this area. It is a low level niggling irritation, which in this case is absolutely intolerable, and there is nothing the person can do about it. There is a need for this type of complaint to be addressed by legislation that will at least provide people with a means of making a complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">If there is a turn in the housing market, the owners of investment properties may sit on the properties in anticipation of a higher return on another day. We have experience of vacant local authority dwellings but we may yet have a problem when the rental market is depressed, with dwellings left vacant, creating difficulties for neighbours. This may become a growing phenomenon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">There is a way of dealing with this problem in local authority dwellings, but it is an entirely different matter where private dwellings are concerned. This must be addressed. If the Minister will not accept the amendments that deal with the general area, he must outline the consideration that is being given to the problem and how it will be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1143">This relates directly to what we have been discussing because under the two sections we are dealing with, section 12 relating to the obligations of landlords and section 51 relating to complaints by third parties in respect of the responsibility of landlords, one may make a complaint to the board but only in respect of the conditions of the dwelling.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1144">Section 12(5) is the relevant section. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1145">For the avoidance of doubt, the condition in <i>subsection 1(g)(i)</i> is satisfied if, after all reasonable attempts, the landlord or his or her authorised agent could not be contacted to make the request concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">According to this legislation, before a tenant goes to the board, the tenant must have made all reasonable attempts to contact the landlord. Similarly in the later subsection to which amendment No. 103 applies, the third party has to have made all reasonable attempts to contact the landlord. I am referring to cases such as that mentioned by Deputies Morgan and Ó Caoláin involving a rented dwelling on a housing estate. If everybody can see that the grass is not being cut and the place is becoming dilapidated, as I understand it they have the right to go to the board and make a complaint. Before going to the board, however, they must have made all reasonable attempts to contact the landlord.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">What does the word "all" mean? Does it mean they attempted to telephone the landlord? That would not comprise "all reasonable attempts" because they could have written to, e-mailed or sent a text to the landlord. They could have put an advertisement in the newspaper to contact the landlord. They could go to Leopardstown Racecourse and see if they could meet him or her in the betting ring. There are several ways of trying to contact the landlord. Under this legislation, one has to have exhausted all of them before going to the board to make a complaint. The same applies to the tenant if it is about conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">This does not change the general thrust of the Bill but I want the word "all" deleted. It is reasonable that a tenant or a third party would make reasonable attempts to contact the landlord and what is reasonable is perfectly capable of being decided by the board. If the word "all" is left in this section and the later section of the Bill, I predict the board will make a decision. A tenant or other person will go to the board. The board will decide, "You wrote to the landlord and the letter was not accepted but we will accept that you made a telephone call and wrote a letter and left a message on the voicemail."</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">Part of this relates to where a tenant carries out work and seeks to be compensated for it. The tenant says the heating broke down and he made an attempt to contact the landlord on a Saturday evening. He will say he telephoned his house and his office but only got a voicemail. There was nothing much else he could do on a Saturday evening and he got a plumber. He is now seeking recovery of the cost of the plumber. I can see the board will say, "That is fair enough. We will compensate you for the money."</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">What then happens is that some day, some landlord will refer that decision of the board to court. He will argue that the tenant did not make all reasonable attempts to contact him. The court will decide that "all" has no other meaning other than "all". "All" is all. If this word is left in the legislation, some day a decision of the board will be struck down. This whole framework put in place by the Minister of State whereby the tenant and a third party can make a complaint to the board about the responsibility of the landlord will come crumbling down because of that little word. I ask the Minister of State to take the word out.</p>

There could be a danger that by deleting the word "all", a person complaining might argue that it might suffice, if there were two people, to communicate with one of the parties but not the other. I think it is safer for the sake of the effectiveness of the provision to retain the existing wording. The section was amended on Committee Stage to facilitate genuine complaints by third parties by enabling the board to provide it with the name and address of the landlord where necessary. It is a case of which word is emphasised. In my opinion, the word "all" is linked to the other. The phrase is "all reasonable". What is reasonable? It is "all reasonable" measures. The simple example is if there were two people to whom one could make a complaint, would it be sufficient to complain to one of them? I have reconsidered it since ——</p>

          <p eId="para_1178">The only conclusion I can draw is that the Minister of State is leaving the word "all" in the text to provide protection to landlords. This section is an exercise in make-believe because it gives tenants rights they will not be able to exercise. The formula of introducing an arrangement whereby a tenant who finds a problem with the standard of a dwelling can make a complaint to the board is a good one. If an urgent circumstance arises, for example, a pipe bursts, the electricity goes off or a window is broken, and the tenant is unable to contact the landlord and arranges for the work to be done, he or she will be able to go to the board to seek recompense in the event that the landlord refuses to reimburse him or her for the cost of the work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">Similarly, in respect of amendment No. 103, if all manner of carry-on is taking place in a let dwelling, the person living next door may go before the board and make a complaint against the landlord of the neighbouring dwelling. The Minister of State is correct that on Committee Stage we provided for an arrangement whereby the board would, in such circumstances, inform the neighbour as to the identity of the landlord to enable him or her to make contact. This provision was not in the original text but inserted by an amendment in my name.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">The problem is that the requirement for contact is too strict. The tenant must contact the landlord and his or her authorised agent or make "all reasonable attempts" to do so. Members understand what is meant by the term "reasonable attempts" and the Minister of State is correct that "reasonable" is the operative word in this context. I believe the board will be capable of deciding what is reasonable in the circumstances. If, for example, something goes wrong in an apartment, even on a Saturday night, reasonable attempts would involve more than making a routine telephone call. If the landlord is not at home but it is possible to track him or her down, it is not unreasonable to expect the tenant to make some attempt to do so, even if that involves telephoning a function, a golf club or elsewhere and attempting to page him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">The term "all reasonable attempts" has a much wider meaning and will, in due course, make it impossible to enforce these sections. This is due to the inclusion of the word "all", for which the Minister of State has given no justifiable reason. It is interesting that he emphasised the word "reasonable". The word "all" in this context can only be construed as placing an obligation on the tenant to use every means available to make contact with the landlord, including, if necessary, cycling to his or her house.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1182">We have considered the proposals since Committee Stage and I have listened to the Deputy's comments. Ultimately, the board will decide whether people made a reasonable attempt to contact their landlords, which is the purpose of the section. While a tenant may not be able to contact the landlord, the question will be whether he or she made only one telephone call in an effort to contact him or her or tried two or three options. Whether contact was made is another issue and the board will decide on these questions. Tenants would not be expected to travel around town on a bicycle. The board will adjudicate on the circumstances and related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">The section tries to convey that tenants are obliged to make reasonable efforts to contact their landlord. It would not be sufficient for a tenant to telephone one person without bothering to telephone another possible contact. He or she should make all reasonable efforts, with "reasonable" being the important word. The board will adjudicate on the matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1202">Having discussed them on Committee Stage, I am not in a position to accept any of the amendments. As regards amendment No. 28, the insertion of references to agents at particular points in the Bill is not appropriate. The relevant requirements are addressed throughout the Bill to landlords, which means that responsibility in all cases rests with landlords, including responsibility for actions of persons acting as agents of the landlord. This means, for example, that any disputes or complaints to the tenancies board or other proceedings will be addressed in the context of the landlord. This ensures there will be a clear, single, ultimate location of responsibility for all actions or failures as regards landlord obligations, irrespective of whether the act in question involved an agent. Inclusion of a reference to agents could only weaken this provision and create scope for doubt and confusion. Agents will be answerable to landlords who engage them, as is the case in any arrangement in which one party engages another to act on his or her behalf. The same applies in the case of tenants, for example, regarding rent being paid through a bank, although this is a less likely occurrence in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">With regard to amendment No. 29, legal advice is that making penalisation of tenants an offence would not be appropriate. It would not be likely to prove useful in practice. Section 14 prohibits penalisation of tenants and if a complaint to the board is upheld damages can be awarded. Non-compliance should not arise but if it does, the section should be invoked to put an end to the penalisation rather than to initiate proceedings in the courts. This will provide the most effective and speedy remedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">With regard to amendment No. 30, it would not be appropriate or beneficial to insert examples of a few matters that might be deemed to involve penalisation. This would only be likely to detract from the effectiveness of the provision. The section provides the most comprehensive definition of "penalisation" in regard to any action that adversely affects the tenant enjoying peaceful occupation of the dwelling and by specifying that such action may constitute penalisation even if it involves action by the landlord that would otherwise be legal. The amendment proposes a blanket provision and it is not recommended that individual examples should be specified.</p>

          <p eId="para_1226">Amendment No. 34 relates to a drafting issue. As section 14 (3)(<i>g</i>) is phrased, the landlord would be entitled to compensation.

The landlord could repair the damage done rather than be compensated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">Amendment No. 40 relates to the insurance policy. It is extremely vague to state, "It shall be a condition of the lease that visitors are not allowed to do anything that would increase the premium payable under an insurance policy".

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1228">With regard to amendment No. 33, the reason for the requirement for a landlord to agree in advance with a tenant a date and time of gaining access to a dwelling is to avoid scenarios where the landlord or the agent might arrive unexpectedly at the tenant's door and seek access. I am surprised the Deputy wants the words "in advance" deleted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">On amendment No. 34, if a tenant causes damage beyond normal wear and tear and does not repair it, the landlord has no option but to undertake the repairs himself or herself and seek to recoup the cost from the tenant, otherwise the landlord could be in breach of his or her statutory obligations under the standards regulations. It would not be appropriate to make the landlord's right of repair in such circumstances subject to obtaining the tenant's permission. Perhaps Deputy Gilmore might reconsider the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">I refer to amendments Nos. 37 and 38. The absolute right to withhold consent to subletting provided for in the legislation was recommended by the Private Rented Sector Commission. It is appropriate, in the context of the four-year security of tenure measure, and it is accompanied by a provision in section 186 whereby tenants bound by a fixed term agreement are given the absolute right to terminate the tenancy where consent to assignment or subletting is refused. On Committee Stage the Deputy understood subtenant to mean a person or persons residing with the tenant. We have since clarified that it means another person taking a new tenancy from the tenant who then becomes the landlord to that subtenant and, consequently, no longer resides in the dwelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">We re-examined amendment No. 44 but it is still reasonable to require the tenant to obtain the landlord's consent before altering a door lock on a rented dwelling. The legislation imposes specific restrictions and obligations on the landlord in regard to access to the dwelling, including the need to agree a date and time with the tenant. These are designed to ensure there is not an unreasonable intrusion by the landlord or agents. Any breach of these provisions can be addressed by referring a complaint to the tenancies board. Of course if there is a need to repair or replace a locking system this would come under the obligations the landlord must discharge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">Amendment No. 47 is not necessary. If it transpires that a landlord has to incur costs in dealing with a request from a tenant it is reasonable that he or she should be reimbursed by the tenant. One could say that a proposal to carry out alterations or to change the use of a property could mean the landlord would have to engage suitably qualified personnel to assess the implications of the proposal. In any event the provision is qualified in that it is restricted to reasonable costs so that the landlord does not have <i>carte blanche</i> in the matter. Under sections 66, 67 and 68 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1980, landlords are entitled to recoup reasonable costs incurred in considering such applications for consent. Those sections will no longer apply to dwellings covered by section 193 of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">Amendment No. 33<i>a</i> in my name proposes the deletion of the word “to” from paragraph (<i>f</i>). It is a late technical amendment, which was only notified the other day by the draftsman.</p>

          <p eId="para_1234">There is a contradiction in the Minister's position on access to a dwelling. He was surprised that I expressed caution in my amendment about the requirement that inspection of a dwelling would have to be agreed in advance between landlord and tenant. I accept it has to be agreed, clearly, but there are circumstances in which a landlord might want to inspect a dwelling at very short notice. He might well want to knock on the door and see what is going on. I may have given this example on Committee Stage but a landlord showed me photographs of the livingroom of an apartment full of newspapers. In the middle of those newspapers was a lit electric bar heater, and the place could have gone up in smoke. There are circumstances in which a landlord might well want to see what is happening at short notice. The Minister of State does not want to allow for that, he wants to provide for advance notice in all circumstances, but on the other hand he does not want to give the tenant the right to change the lock.</p>

          <p eId="para_1237">As for changing the lock and not allowing the landlord a veto on that, I cited circumstances in which a tenant may be afraid of the landlord. A female tenant may be uncomfortable with her landlord and uncomfortable with the lock on the door. She may not wish to ask for permission to change the lock. She should be entitled to change it, but under the legislation she will not be allowed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">We debated this on Committee Stage and I do not propose to repeat that debate, but I am disappointed the Minister of State has not squared this up.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1275">In page 27, line 41, to delete "market" and substitute "fair".</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">I will also refer to amendments Nos. 56 and 159 because all these amendments are aimed at establishing a mechanism to ensure a fair as opposed to a market level of rent. The best mechanism is a book of quantum with which we are familiar because it was discussed during the debate on the Civil Liability and Courts Bill earlier. I propose a similar book of quantum, which would be a fair and reasonable method to ensure that rip-off merchants are rooted out of the private rented sector. It would go a long way to ensuring an end to rack-renting by landlords. A book of quantum would also ensure that even if the market moved, the book of quantum would move accordingly because its construction would embrace an entire area in terms of arriving at the cost of rent. If the private rented sector is to be a viable long-term option, then we must deal with the overpricing in the sector and I suggest the book of quantum is the fairest means available to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 refer to the notice landlords must give tenants for the purpose of increasing rental levels. The Bill provides for 28 days but I propose an amendment because 28 days is not enough time for tenants to adjust their budget in the case of rent increases. It is important to remember that many people get paid on a monthly basis. To adjust to the new rental level, I suggest an additional month is necessary. We all know many people in the private rented sector pay a substantial proportion of their income on rent, which is their greatest expenditure. That being the case, one month, or 28 days, is not enough for tenants to be able to adjust to meet that requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">In any event, it is unlikely that landlords will decide on a whim to give one month's notice of a rent increase. We would reasonably expect landlords to give some consideration to a rental increase before implementing it. All we are asking landlords to do, therefore, is to give an additional four weeks' notice to the tenant. That is a reasonable request. I hope the Minister of State will consider the amendment positively.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_478">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1279">Amendment No. 60<i>a</i> in my name refers to a similar issue. It brings us back to the three Fs for which Michael Davitt campaigned during the Land League in the 1870s. They included fair rent, fixity of tenure and freedom of sale. In the context of this Bill, there are not three Fs; there is not even one F being delivered in full to the tenant. If there is an F being delivered to the tenant, it is an F that was not envisaged by Michael Davitt and which cannot be repeated in this House. The tenant is not getting a fair deal in this legislation. We need a fair rent as my colleague, Deputy Morgan, said. The Green Party has attempted to define that. We believe a fair rent should not increase dramatically over time and that any annual rent increase should be capped at 5% over the rate of inflation in any given year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">We do not believe market rents are fair in our towns and cities in 2004. Many of the most vulnerable tenants in our society have faced massive rent increases over the past few years — sometimes in excess of 50%. That is not fair on those tenants who are often lone parents. We cannot allow that to continue and we must put some modicum of respect for tenants into the legislation. I am not looking for rents to be cast in stone and not allow any possibility for change. I believe we are allowing for a reasonable amount of change over time. We believe 5% annually over the rate of inflation is reasonable. We do not believe it will grind the market to a halt. It will give a certain quantum of respect for the tenant and for the landlord. I will press my amendment on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">I am not convinced that the fixity of tenure referred to in the Bill is the right way to proceed. After six months, the tenant, subject to various conditions, has a right to remain for four years but, at the expiry of those four years, the landlord can give 16 weeks' notice to the tenant. I do not believe that is the right way to proceed. A fairer way to proceed is for rights to accrue to tenant and landlord on an incremental basis. We suggest that, after one month, a right of a 20% time to remain should kick in. In other words, after five weeks there should be one week's tenure in favour of the tenant, after five months the figure is one month, after five years it is one year, and after 20 years it is four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">On a sliding incremental scale, rights should accrue to the tenant, which would be a fairer way to proceed. It would bring about a more mature market since many people are renting in fear because they feel they can be kicked out without too much notice. If the Bill is enacted as currently drafted, tenants could be kicked out after four years with 16 weeks' notice. Even after 16 years, the fourth period of occupation, they could still be kicked out with 16 weeks' notice. That is not fair, particularly for elderly tenants who are seeking some continuity and certainty concerning the period they can remain as tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">It is fair that after 16 years one can give four years' notice. It gives the landlord a reasonable expectation of what he or she can do, as well as giving the tenant a reasonable expectation of what can happen. It is not fair, however, every four years to be dumped in it, and told that one can be kicked out with 16 weeks' notice. That principle does not apply in the rest of Europe and it is not one that should be applied here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">The legislation does not provide for fair rents or a fair analysis of fixity of tenure. My amendments, along with Deputy Morgan's amendment seeking fair rents, would go a long way towards improving the legislation by giving a degree of maturity to the market. They would give respect both to the landlord and tenant. That is the least we should expect in this type of legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_479">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_1285">Rents in the private rented sector are daft. In Dublin and other large urban areas, the levels of rent that private sector tenants are required to pay are higher than the mortgage for the same property. People are paying €1,000 to €1,200 per month in rent for a three-bedroom dwelling, but it would cost them less to pay the mortgage for the same property and they would still have a considerable amount left over.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">There is some evidence that the rent situation may be turning. There is certainly anecdotal evidence that the increased supply of rental properties over the past year or 18 months is beginning to have some impact on rents. For the past four or five years tenants have been the victims of this market, which has been distorted by the Government's failure to deal with housing. The market is distorted because it is full of people on low incomes who cannot get local authority housing and so have to rent privately. They cannot afford to buy because of what has happened to house prices. If people are on social welfare they will at least get a rent allowance, but if they are working and on a low income they are being screwed by high rents. Such people have been the victims of rising rents in an upward market in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">I realise this is a judgment call, but if we are now at a point where the market will begin to work somewhat in favour of the tenant and cause some kind of downward pressure on rents, then I would be in favour of allowing the tenant to benefit from that. I understand the aim of Deputy Morgan's amendment is to ensure that the new rent would not kick in for 56 days, rather than 28 days. If the rent is going up, I am in favour of that and make no apology for it. If however, rents are being adjusted downwards, which may be happening in some cases, I do not see why the landlord should have the benefit of an additional month at the higher rent. While I accept what is behind Deputy Morgan's amendment, in a situation where there may be a downturn in rents, it may work the other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">In respect of my amendment No. 52, where a landlord is seeking an increase in rent, the burden of proof should be on the landlord to show that the increased rent is not higher than the market rent. Or the burden of proof should be on the landlord to show that the existing rent is in line with market rent, and not ahead of it. In the absence of that, the burden of proof will shift to the tenant but many tenants cannot shop around and there is no list of prevailing rents in a given area. The amendment is important in that it seeks to place the burden of proof on the landlord to show that the rent is in line with market rent.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_480" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1289">I cannot accept amendments Nos. 51, 56 and 159 to sections 19, 24 and 152, respectively. They would in effect amount to a form of rent regulation by the private tenancies board, which is not one of the functions envisaged for it by the commission on the private rented sector. The board will not necessarily be bound by everything the commission said, but its report is the base document from which we have derived the legislation. It also contravenes the commission's strong opposition to all forms of rent control, in view of the adverse effects rent control has had in the past, both here and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">The rent provisions in the Bill are based on ensuring that the rent charged to any tenant does not exceed the going market rent for the type, standard and location of property involved. That is the term the commission went by — not fair rent, but market rent — and that is the concept we are working on. The provisions proposed by Deputy Morgan would not be compatible with this approach. Moreover, they would allow the charging of rents above the market rate where the commission considered such rents to be fair. Such provisions would not mean that tenants would always benefit from the impact that a greater supply of rental accommodation should have on rent levels. However, one of the functions of the board is to advise me of any legislative amendments that seem to be necessary, particularly concerning the operation of the provisions in Part 3 dealing with rent setting and rent reviewing. If the board ever forms the view that market rent is being manipulated, it will advise the Minister of the day that this aspect of the legislation is not working as was intended, and will make recommendations for its amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">As regards amendment No. 52, which seeks to prove that the increased rent is not above the market level, the legal advice is that it is not necessary or appropriate to include specific provisions in the Bill concerning the onus of proof in disputes about rents, or any other disputes coming before the board. It will be primarily for the board, in developing its disputes resolution procedures, to adopt an appropriate approach to the onus of proof it will apply in respect of any dispute coming before it, subject to all the usual requirements. It is considered that the dispute resolution provisions are as explicit as would be appropriate. It would not be appropriate to assign the onus of proof to landlords on an across-the-board basis. Deputy Gilmore referred to the onus of proof, but the position is that whoever brings the case will have to prove it, which is as it should be.</p>

            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_1292">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. The school to which I refer was built in 1918 and since then nothing has been done with it. It is located in the outskirts of Ballina in a growing area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">The proposed extension is costed at €100,000 but will fail to address the pressing needs of the school, even though sanction had been given for satisfactory development of the school in August 2001 — before the general election. Sanction for that extension would have cost in excess of €300,000 but was withdrawn after the general election even though planning had proceeded to stage 3. This plan was replaced by the scaled-down development with instructions that the costs were not to exceed €100,000, which is a case of penny wise and euro foolish.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">The location of the post-election cut-back extension is governed by and based on a decrepit and rat-infested terrapin which will have to be torn down in any case and which will interfere with the existing permanent classrooms, requiring further futile expenditure while pupils and teachers continue to lack proper and adequate accommodation and are confined to draughty and unhealthy conditions. There is a great need for temporary accommodation in the meantime. The original plan was the best one and, in the interests of sanity and common sense, it should be reverted to. What is now proposed is idiotic, futile and a recipe for disaster.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">In May 2000 an application was submitted. In October 2001, the Department agreed to planning for improved accommodation including a general purpose classroom, three store rooms and two rooms of 20 sq. metres. On 29 October, after the general election, the Department announced it was not in a position to grant-aid the project. That is the sorry saga of this school project. What was proposed would have been adequate for the area and would have included a PE classroom, a general purpose classroom to replace the existing prefab, a multi-purpose room to include a teaching staff room, a library resource room and so on. It is unfortunate that the cut–rate plan was introduced, which is totally unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">The school was built in 1918 and is like any old country school when it all began, with one single classroom. This is now a growing area in the suburbs of Ballina. Housing estates have been mooted opposite the school. There is no proper space and pupils and teachers are very discommoded. The board of management and parents are very concerned about the lack of proper accommodation for the recently appointed learning support teacher, who currently tries to create a suitable learning environment in the entrance lobby of a prefab. This is totally unsatisfactory for teacher and pupil. Furthermore, the teacher has no storage space for the necessary materials or to keep pupil profiles.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">The requirements are a room for the learning support teacher, a room for the resource teacher and a general purpose area. If, for instance, health screening or immunisation programmes are required for the children, as they are from time to time, it requires the complete evacuation of a classroom. This is very disruptive. Physical education is part of the revised curriculum and is extremely important but it cannot take place in the school because of the lack of facilities. Similarly, library storage space, the new reading initiative, the introduction of science and increased awareness of the need for materials in the classroom lead to a need for extra storage space which is not available. The increased amount of paperwork, together with the increased number of meetings of educational psychologists, resource teachers, learning support teachers, parents and so on, demands extra office space.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">The Department's proposals in regard to the school are idiotic. The plan is ridiculous because it renders useless the existing building which will require major expensive alterations and the retention of the terrapin. If the terrapin rots, how will the school be extended? The entire situation is nonsensical and the planning is based on a prefab which is past its best before date and is falling down. It is an irrational basis for any type of development. No business or house would be developed along these lines. The situation is unacceptable and in the meantime there is a great need for temporary accommodation. Will the Minister of State outline what is happening in regard to the school?</p>

            <p eId="para_1299">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, to outline to the House the position regarding the proposed building project at Knockanillo national school, Ballina, County Mayo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">The board of management of Knockanillo national school applied to the school building section of my Department in April 2000 for the provision of additional ancillary accommodation at the school. A design team was appointed in October 2001 and architectural design began. The project progressed, as the Deputy stated, to stage 3 of the Department's procedures. Following an examination of this submission the school authorities were informed that an extension-cum-refurbishment project could proceed at the school, provided that it could be delivered within an upper cost limit of €100,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">In May of this year the school authorities of Knockanillo national school were offered a devolved grant to alleviate their accommodation needs. This initiative operates on a devolved basis and allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding. There is minimal interaction with my Department and schools are fully empowered to drive the design and construction process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">Under the scheme, 70% of the funds must be drawn down before the end of November this year. Provision for the remaining 30% will have to be included as a commitment in the 2005 budgetary allocation which will be in the context of the multi-annual approach which my Department is adopting, further details of which will be available later this year. In the event that temporary accommodation is required in the short term, pending the provision of the proposed extension, the school should contact my Department in the matter.</p>

            <from>Mr. Finneran</from>
            <p eId="para_1304">I ask the Minister for Education and Science to address the proposed refurbishment and extension at Scoil Mhuire Convent of Mercy, Strokestown, County Roscommon. I have tabled this motion for the Minister's attention because of representations, which have been made to me by the principal, staff, parents and the community generally in Strokestown and its catchment area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">I acknowledge the contribution which has been made by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to the education system in County Roscommon to date. In particular, I compliment him on his enormous contribution to the primary sector. He has provided new or refurbished schools in three areas within the catchment of this post-primary school. He has been a great friend to County Roscommon regarding the provision of new schools and the extension and refurbishment of schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to respond to the debate. I raise this matter because of representations I have received from the principal on behalf of the teachers, parents, pupils and the community. They have been in contact with the Department since 1999 regarding refurbishment, extension and provision of PE facilities at Scoil Mhuire Convent of Mercy, Strokestown. They are disappointed they are still at stage one, band 2, and are seeking that progress be made on their application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">I fully endorse the sentiments of the principal on behalf of all involved, on the basis that Strokestown is a vibrant town that has found a new lease of life in recent years, given that a large number of new houses have been built there. It has an active development association and much development work is taking place in the catchment area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">It has been clearly stated by the principal that there is insufficient space. They work under poor conditions and must use a community hall for their PE activity. Unfortunately, the community hall did not get finance under the sports capital programme to carry out the necessary works to enable the PE activity to continue. There is a need to expedite the refurbishment and extension and the provision of PE facilities at Scoil Mhuire Convent of Mercy, Strokestown.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">I appreciate there are many demands on the Minister and that he has made an enormous contribution to the education system and the provision of education facilities in County Roscommon. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to convey to the Minister the urgent need to progress this project. A genuine case has been put forward by the principal and all involved. I wish to align myself with their request and ask that it be progressed at a faster pace than in the past four or five years. It is imperative that this case be moved forward and that the principal, staff, pupils and others should be made aware of the timescale involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1311">A full design team has been appointed and architectural design of the major project at the school is progressing. This school is listed in section 9 of the 2004 school building programme which is published on the Department's website. This proposed project is currently at stage one of architectural planning-site suitability-site survey. It has been assigned a band 2 rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">The 2004 school building programme at primary and post-primary level amounts to €387 million and outlines details of over 200 large-scale projects proceeding to construction, 120 projects recently completed or under construction and over 400 projects at various stages of the architectural planning process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">When publishing the 2004 schools building programme, the Department outlined that its strategy would be grounded in capital investment based on multi-annual allocations. Officials from the Department are reviewing all projects which were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme, including Scoil Mhuire Convent of Mercy, Strokestown, with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme for 2005. The Department expects to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year.</p>

I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, who will reply to this matter. He has a particular responsibility for this brief and I appreciate his presence at this late hour. It is an indication of his concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">This question has been raised on behalf of approximately 60 general operatives who are employed throughout the country by the various fisheries boards, all of which come under the umbrella of the Central Fisheries Board. Coming from an important lake district of the midlands, I have an obvious interest in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">I am pleased to note that thousands of employees of the various health boards and local authorities throughout the country and officers within the fisheries boards can look forward to the second payment of 50% under the recent benchmarking agreement. This is important in the context of increasing the wages of various personnel in those areas who were on low wages for a long period. While these people can look forward to their deserved moneys under the agreement, the 60 general operatives employed by the fisheries boards still await their first payment. These workers still await the release of a document from the Central Fisheries Board or the Department of Finance on which to ballot. Payment under the benchmarking agreement has been protracted in regard to this sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">These State employees are sick and tired of being treated like second-class citizens. A certain amount of frustration and anger is building up among them when it comes to the payment of such national agreements. It is worth reflecting that in 2001 these same workers experienced similar frustration and anger as payment of moneys due under the analogue agreement was extremely protracted in its execution and final implementation. Three years on history is repeating itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">So far as I am aware - and the Minister of State has the full facts - a letter was forwarded by SIPTU in November 2003 to the management of the Central Fisheries Board. This raised concerns pertaining to the protracted nature of the 2001 scenario and requested that a repetition should be avoided at all costs. Since then numerous representations by SIPTU, on behalf of the general operatives, have resulted in little or no relevant information emanating from the Central Fisheries Board or the Department of Finance. Perhaps it is the dead hand of the Department of Finance that is delaying this matter. It was essential to ascertain the timeframe and the structure of the payment of the first phase of the parallel benchmarking for these workers to which they are duly entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">This matter has dragged on. Somebody has to grasp the nettle and ensure the payment to which the general operatives are duly entitled is forthcoming. I ask the Minister of State for a positive reply.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
            <p eId="para_1320">I thank Deputy Penrose for raising this issue. The pay relationship referred to by the Deputy applies to the general operative grades employed by the central and regional fisheries boards which are modelled on similar grades within the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">Under the general operatives and related grades parallel benchmarking pay arrangements, these employees of the fisheries boards are entitled to pay awards subject to the agreement of management and unions to a modernisation plan. In this case the modernisation plan had to be modelled on the plan for the local authorities which was approved and published last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">The preparation and drafting of the modernisation plan had to be discussed and agreed with the unions and management of the seven regional fisheries boards and the central board. It must be recognised that there is a process to be followed in the granting of these awards and that negotiations on issues of this nature can understandably take some time to complete. In addition, payment of an award is contingent on Department of Finance approval of the revised scale amounts and the proposed method of implementation of awards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">The formally agreed and signed modernisation plan must also be approved by the performance verification group which operates within my Department. This is a high level group which is responsible for verifying performance as set out in modernisation action plans for fisheries boards and other non-commercial semi-State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">On 17 May 2004, the Central Fisheries Board submitted on behalf of the regional fisheries boards a draft modernisation plan covering pay and modernisation for the general operative grades. In addition, details of the draft scales, which will apply to the general operative grades, together with the proposed method of implementation of the awards, were submitted to my Department on 4 June 2004 for consideration and approval by the Department of Finance. Approval of the draft scales and method of implementation is expected to be forthcoming from the Department shortly. My Department has been informed by the Central Fisheries Board that approval of the draft scales must be received before the draft modernisation plan can be formally agreed and signed by management and unions. When the formally agreed plan is received by my Department, it will be assessed as quickly as possible by the performance verification group. I am advised that arrangements to pay the awards will be made as soon as possible after the plan, has been approved by the verification group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">While I appreciate that employees of the fisheries boards are anxious to receive their pay increases, I emphasise that this is not a straightforward pay round. Increases are linked to the adoption of a modernisation strategy, the formulation and adoption of which necessarily takes time to complete. The timeframe since receipt of the revised scales by my Department for approval on 4 June cannot be considered unreasonably long. I assure the Deputy that all necessary steps are being taken to ensure that payment of the awards to the general operative grades will be made at the earliest possible date with appropriate retrospective effect.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_487">
            <from>Mr. Allen</from>
            <p eId="para_1326">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter. I do so because the reply I received to Question No. 321 submitted for written answer yesterday was not satisfactory. The reply was not specific enough to deal with the issues I raised. As a result, I intend to set out the position in more detail here tonight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">I am concerned that in the wake of the Lindsay tribunal no consultant haematologist with an interest in haemophilia has been appointed by the Southern Health Board. Recommendations Nos. 4, 5 and 7 of the tribunal are not being implemented. The Southern Health Board has sought a haemophilia consultant appointment, the paperwork for which was sent to the Department in autumn 2003. Despite this, the post has not yet been sanctioned and two recent letters from the health board on the matter have failed to elicit an explanation for the delay. I ask the Minister for Health and Children to explain why there is a delay in sanctioning this badly needed post, why haemophilia facilities in Cork are not being upgraded and why the recommendations of the Lindsay tribunal are not being implemented in Cork University Hospital, which has the highest number of patients with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders after St. James's Hospital in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">The gap between facilities in Cork and Dublin is enormous. While there are three consultants specifically detailed to deal with these issues in Dublin, Cork is awaiting the appointment of one. The Lindsay report was published in 2002 although the problems it highlighted were known before then. The Southern Health Board had a haematologist from 1979 to 2002 who dealt with leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, general haematology, a laboratory, blood transfusion, haemophilia and teaching. Even this list is not complete. In November 2000, there were 62 patients with bleeding disorders recorded on the database in Cork. In 2002, 150 patients were registered and by January 2004 this number had increased to 221.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">Currently, there are no facilities for adult haemophilia patients at Cork University Hospital. There is no haematology day unit and patients are seen as a result at locations which include the accident and emergency and radiotherapy departments. The Minister must agree that both locations are inappropriate. Basic equipment such as needles and syringes are carried around by the haemophilia nurse who has no clinical base. There is only one whole-time equivalent haemophilia nurse as a result of which adequate patient follow-up is difficult to arrange in advance. There is no facility for private consultation or counselling, which Judge Lindsay referred to in recommendation No. 7 of her report. There is no current facility for recording patient attendance other than the record kept by the specialist haemophilia nurse and there is a danger that record keeping will be inadequate without a dedicated base. In this regard, I refer the Minister to Lindsay tribunal recommendation No. 5.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">This is a serious issue. Requests have been made to the Department but neither a response nor an explanation has been forthcoming.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1331">I thank Deputy Allen for raising this matter. In the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I will respond to the issues raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">The provision of hospital services and the appointment of staff at Cork University Hospital are matters for the Southern Health Board. Among a number of applications for consultant posts, the board has submitted an application to the Department of Health and Children for a new post at the hospital of consultant haematologist with an interest in haemophilia. The question of funding for additional consultant posts can only be considered in the context of the Southern Health Board's priorities for services in the acute hospitals sector. The matter is under consideration and the Department will revert to the Southern Health Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">Officials of the Department are working with the Irish Haemophilia Society and treating physicians under the auspices of the National Haemophilia Council to progress the implementation of the recommendations in the Lindsay report. The establishment of the council was a key recommendation. I assure the Deputy that the needs of the Southern Health Board together with the needs of the other regional boards will be fully taken into account in the implementation process. Furthermore, a consultant from Cork University Hospital is the nominated representative of the Irish Haematology Society on the National Haemophilia Council and the product selection and monitoring advisory group. The Council and the group are the principal representative bodies advising the Minister on haemophilia care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">The major recommendation made by Judge Lindsay in her report is that persons with haemophilia must have continued access to blood products of the highest standard and safest nature available. In 2003, priority was given to the work of the product selection and monitoring advisory group. As a result of the considerable time and effort dedicated to ensuring that the views of stakeholders were given due consideration, the group was in a position to advise the Irish Blood Transfusion Service on the safest and most efficacious products for the treatment of haemophilia nationally for the period 2003 to 2005. This represents a major achievement of the collaborative process undertaken by all concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">Last April, the Minister was invited by the National Haemophilia Council to launch a major quality initiative in the delivery of haemophilia care. This project, which will meet a number of the recommendations of the Lindsay tribunal, will provide a new international standard to ensure excellence in the storage, delivery, prescription and administration of haemophilia products. The project will help to ensure that the care provided to persons with haemophilia will be of a consistently high standard regardless of where they live. Another initiative which is well under way is the development of a national viral assessment programme and haemophilia database which will meet key concerns outlined in the Lindsay report, especially those relating to medical records, including test results. The programme will support the delivery of patient care both in the national centre for hereditary coagulation disorders at St. James's Hospital in Dublin and treating centres nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">The Irish Haematology Society is working with the National Haemophilia Council on the development of national treatment protocols and a patient information day is being planned for November to launch them.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1341">The indemnity agreement provided that the property contribution of the congregations was to be divided into two separate and distinct schedules of properties: (a) properties to be transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies or local authorities after the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002 — the total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be €36.54 million; (b) properties transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations between 11 May 1999 and the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002 — the total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be €40.32 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">With regard to (a), agreement in principle has been reached with the religious congregations on the transfer of properties and cash to the value of €36.54 million. Just under €5 million has actually been provided by the congregations in cash rather than property, as provided for in the indemnity agreement. With regard to (b), my Department has accepted in principle properties to the value of approximately €27 million. This leaves a current shortfall of approximately €13.5 million. In this regard, my Department is awaiting a valuation on a school property which has been accepted in principle and a number of other properties that have been offered by the congregations are under consideration. It is possible that the conclusion of the position on these properties could finalise this schedule. In this regard, it is anticipated that a meeting between officials and the congregations with a view to reaching agreement in principle on all outstanding property matters will take place shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">I do not intend to give details regarding the identity of the properties at this point. However, I hope to be in a position to publish the full list of properties in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1348">Children with dyslexia have, up to now, generally been catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools where they can be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. At present, there are approximately 2,600 resource teachers and 1,531 learning support teachers in the primary system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">However, the Deputy may be aware that my Department has recently developed a new weighted system of allocation of teaching supports for special needs pupils. An additional 350 teaching posts are being allocated to facilitate the introduction of the new system. The new arrangements will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, such as borderline mild and mild general learning disability and dyslexia and those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs. Further details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">Where the condition of a pupil with dyslexia is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 9:1. My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment, such as computers, to assist children with special needs with their education, including children with dyslexia, where recommended by relevant professionals. Schools may apply, through the special education section of my Department, for this support. Supporting documentation should include reports of psychological and other relevant professional assessments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1352">It is my intention that all applications for special educational resources received by 30 June 2004 will be responded to before the commencement of the 2004-05 school year. Applications for resource teacher support that were received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 for which a response is outstanding have been considered and schools have now been notified of the outcome. This outcome indicates to schools the resources that may be put in place immediately. Applications received after 31 August 2003 and by 30 June 2004 will be processed in the near future and the outcome will be notified to schools before the commencement of the 2004-05 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">The teacher allocations involved will be made in the context of a new weighted system which I announced recently. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability and also those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of giving children an even break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils. It is intended that the details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher incidence special educational needs and this will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in the higher incidence categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities. My Department now proposes to devise clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. The Department will communicate with schools in this regard before the commencement of the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1356">Schools which have applied for special needs assistant support will be advised of the outcome of their applications as soon as possible in advance of the next school year. Account is being taken of existing levels of special needs assistant support allocation in schools. In cases where a reduction in the level of special needs assistant support is proposed, there will be provision for schools to appeal, having regard to the care needs of the pupils concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">Finally, my Department recognises the difficulties some schools have been experiencing while awaiting the outcome of applications for special educational resource and the introduction of the weighted model. The process has been complex and time consuming and I am endeavouring to have all aspects completed as quickly as possible. I also wish to acknowledge the co-operation and support of schools in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1362">Plans for the establishment of the teaching council are at an advanced stage. I have recently announced the appointment of Ms Áine Lawler as first director of the council and it is anticipated that she will take up her position in the near future. I wish Áine well in this important and challenging position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">The drafting of the regulations for the first election to the council is also nearing completion and I expect that these regulations will be laid before the Dáil in the near future. The first election to the teaching council is planned for the autumn with a view to the council sitting for the first time before the end of the current year. The teaching council will provide an important and influential forum for shaping the development of the teaching profession from initial recruitment and induction to in-career professional development. The responsibilities of teachers in promoting teaching as a profession and in recruiting the next generation of teachers will also form an important role for the teaching council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">I am confident the teaching council will raise the public profile of teaching as a profession and will be of benefit to teachers, the education system generally and to learners.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1367">I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 141 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has carried out a comprehensive public consultation process on the future direction of senior cycle education in Ireland. This concluded with the publication by the NCCA of "Directions for Development — Developing Senior Cycle Education", which was presented at a national forum in Dublin Castle on 23 September 2003. This forum was attended by representatives of all the partners in education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">The NCCA proposals set out a vision for the type of school system which might exist by 2010. The proposals envisage a restructured senior cycle curriculum consisting of transition units, short courses and subjects. Innovatory features of the leaving certificate vocational programme and the transition year programme would be incorporated into transition units that would focus on areas such as work related learning, special studies, community participation, arts education, ICT literacy and study skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">The option of a two or three year cycle would be retained and the leaving certificate applied programme would continue as a discrete programme. All pupils, including LCA pupils, would follow at least one transition unit and many pupils would take a greater number. The proposals provide also for an increased emphasis on a wider range of modes of assessment such as practical, portfolio or project work and continuous assessment, with assessment events spread out during courses of study and available at a number of points during the two-or three-year cycle. As the innovatory features of the transition year programme are being retained, there are no plans to provide for inclusion of elements of the programme within the junior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">Publication of "Directions for Development" has been followed by further analyses and consultation by the NCCA in the lead-up to the council's presentation of advice and recommendations to me on the future of senior cycle. I met representatives of the NCCA on 16 June 2004 to discuss the broad outline of its proposals and the written initial advice that has been approved by the NCCA council will be submitted to me formally in the coming days. The advice will be in two stages. While the first stage will be overview advice, the second will include an elaboration of the possible configuration of subjects, short courses and transition units, details of how assessment might be managed, an analysis of the implications for staff development and infrastructure and a detailed action plan for implementing the proposal. This advice is due at the end of the current calendar year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">The NCCA's overview advice proposes that the existing senior cycle will continue until 2007. Over the period 2005 to 2007, extensive actions are planned to rebalance subjects to reduce content and allow more time for embedding of core skills, to develop transition units and short courses and to implement practical bottom-up pilots in schools to develop models of practice and assess implications. It is envisaged that by 2007, junior cycle would commence for new students in year 1 and they would be ready to begin the restructured senior cycle in autumn 2010.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1374">My Department has provided annual funding of €63,500 to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland since 1999. This funding has helped the association to operate an information service for members and the public. In addition, this funding has assisted in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">My Department has received representations from certain branches of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland expressing concern at the escalating costs of running the workshops, particularly in the context of current taxation laws which they say are resulting in increased costs for the association and, by extension, for the parents of the children availing of the service. Issues relating to tax affairs are a matter between the Dyslexia Association of Ireland and the individual teachers concerned. The question of exempting voluntary groups from tax requirements is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and my Department would have no role in this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">I am satisfied that there have been significant improvements in the level of school based education services for children with dyslexia in recent years. Such children have, up to now, generally been catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools where they can be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. At present, there are approximately 2,600 resource teachers and 1,531 learning support teachers in the primary system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">My Department has recently developed a new weighted system of allocation of teaching supports for special needs pupils, including those with dyslexia. The allocation of an additional 350 teaching posts for special needs and a new system for the allocation of resources for special needs in primary schools have now been approved. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, such as borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, such as dyslexia, and those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of giving children an even break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils. In addition, all schools will be able to apply for separate specific allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities. It is intended that the details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">Where the condition is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 9:1. My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special needs with their education, including children with dyslexia, where recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply, through the special education section of my Department for this support. Supporting documentation should include reports of psychological and other relevant professional assessments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1381">A new physical education, PE, curriculum is being introduced into primary schools as part of the primary curriculum. It is planned that the new PE curriculum will be in place for the start of the 2006-07 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">My Department is aware from recent media reports of an INTO survey on physical education facilities in primary schools. The issue of PE facilities in primary schools was one of a number of matters discussed at a meeting in June held between officials in my Department's planning and building unit and the INTO. At this meeting the INTO accepted that, with regard to schools where such facilities were inadequate, a balance was required in the division of the funding allocation for the various sub-categories of the school building programme with appropriate priority being given to the provision of mainstream classroom accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">The provision of multi-purpose space for primary schools will continue to be considered within the design brief for new schools and/or renovation and extension school building projects. This is being done in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects. In terms of resources, the Government is delivering on its commitment to provide modern facilities in schools and has progressively increased funding in recent years, with an aggregate total of almost €2 billion being provided since 1998, the largest investment programme in the history of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">My Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of underinvestment in school infrastructure. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme, which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing to tender in this year's programme. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1386">I am satisfied that the new weighted model of teacher allocation for pupils with special educational and learning support needs teaching will significantly improve the level of service provided for such pupils. To facilitate the introduction of the new system, an additional 350 posts are being made available. This will bring the total number of such posts for pupils with low achievement and special educational needs to almost 4,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with learning support needs and those with higher incidence special needs, such as borderline mild and mild general learning disability and dyslexia. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with more acute needs. The general weighted allocation system will greatly reduce the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments and will put resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty over their resource levels. This will allow for better planning in schools and greater flexibility in identifying and intervening earlier with regard to pupils' special needs, as well as making the posts more attractive to qualified teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">The previous allocation system placed significant demands on principals, teachers and psychologists. It has also proven to be time consuming, thereby delaying the allocation of resources for special needs. Action had to be taken to reform the system and the model now being introduced will, over time, significantly improve the capacity of the system to cater for children with special needs in a speedier, more effective way. The revised system will reduce the administrative burden on schools and allow them to concentrate on the delivery of services to pupils with special needs. It will also allow psychologists to devote more time to advising teachers on planning for individual children and for whole school provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">My Department has communicated with schools about their allocations. Permission will be given to fill all specific allocations immediately. The general weighted allocations will be filled following the determination of clustering and reallocation arrangements. To ease the transition to the new system, my Department has already agreed not to redeploy teachers from full-time posts via the panel redeployment process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1430">The numbers of entrants, not sits, in the leaving certificate examinations in 2004 are as follows: leaving certificate, established — 48,143; leaving certificate, applied — 3,620; other, including adults — 4,331; total — 56,124.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">The decline is in line with changing demographic trends and declining birth rates in the 1980s. The decline in the numbers sitting the leaving certificate as a result of the falling birth rate has been substantially mediated in recent years by an inflow of immigrants and returning emigrants into Ireland. In September 2003, 3,546 students from abroad entered State-aided second level schools in Ireland. Further modest reductions in pupil numbers are expected in the coming years but assuming current trends in inward migration, the reduction is expected to be only of the order of 4% to 6%. By 2013, based on rising birth rates in the 1990s, the numbers of students sitting the leaving certificate one expected to rise again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">The reducing number of students at leaving certificate level does not reflect a decline in the proportion of students remaining in school to completion of senior cycle. In fact, the available data suggest that retention rates have been stable since the early 1990s at 81% to 82%, and a range of actions are in place across the system to prevent early school leaving and increase retention rates in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">With regard to entry to third level education, the actual numbers of students entering full-time third level courses have remained relatively stable since 1999 at approximately 35,800. However, the proportion of school candidates who sat the leaving certificate and subsequently entered higher education on a full-time basis has increased from 55% in 1998 to 66% in 2003, allied with an increase in the proportion of mature student entrants from approximately 5% to10%. The modest decline, therefore, in the numbers sitting the leaving certificate is not expected to result in a reduction in third level places in the future but rather an increased entry rate from initial schooling and more opportunities for adult re-entrants.</p>

            <p eId="para_1435">Since coming into office, the Government has continuously increased capital funding for educational infrastructure. Since 1997, and to the end of the current year, in excess of €2 billion will have been expended on primary and post-primary infrastructure alone. This clearly demonstrates the Government's unequivocal commitment to addressing our school infrastructural needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">This year, my Department's school building programme of €388 million will deliver in excess of 260 significant school building projects at primary and post-primary levels. In excess of 200 of these projects will commence on site in the current year; the remaining projects commenced in previous years and are currently nearing completion. Furthermore, over 570 additional schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme directly by means of temporary accommodation, permanent accommodation and/or improvements works. All primary schools will benefit directly from the devolved grant scheme for minor works.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">This programme of works involves in many instances the replacement with permanent structures of old prefabricated classrooms. While an extensive refurbishment or rebuild project is either progressing in the building programme or under consideration for inclusion it is sometimes necessary to meet the immediate needs of a school with temporary accommodation. In many instances this arises because of the significant numbers of extra teachers allocated to schools. Putting a high quality prefabricated classroom on site quickly is what enables the appointment of an additional teacher in many instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">Major building projects cannot be delivered in a short period of time. A complex range of factors governs the life cycle of any potential building project from design through compliance with the planning process to construction. My Department sanctions the wide use of external consultants to expedite the design and delivery of the vast majority of projects. New ways such as the devolved building initiative for small rural schools, the permanent accommodation initiative and the summer works scheme show my Department's commitment to finding innovative and flexible solutions to the difficulties faced by schools seeking to refurbish their buildings or to provide additional accommodation quickly. There is minimal interaction with my Department and schools are fully empowered to drive the design and construction process. I fully expect that these initiatives will inform future policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme which, in turn, will provide greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing to tender in this year's programme. I will make a further announcement on this matter later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1445">The most recently published analysis by my Department of retention rates at second level was released in August 2003. The report indicates that of those pupils who commenced the junior cycle programme in September 1994 approximately 3,900 or 5.7% left school before completing the junior certificate three years later and approximately 12,500 or 18.2% left school without the leaving certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">My Department's commitment to tackling early school leaving is reflected in the national anti-poverty strategy, the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, 2003-2005, and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative on tackling educational disadvantage in literacy, numeracy and early school leavers. My Department's approach to addressing the issue of early school leaving comprises legislative and curricular reforms as well as preventative interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">The Education (Welfare) Act, which was fully commenced on 5 July 2002, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">My Department operates a number of programmes, including the giving children an even break programme and the home school community liaison scheme, which provide additional supports for children in primary and post-primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. My Department's main programme for tackling early school leaving is the school completion programme, which was launched in 2002. This programme incorporates the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, SSRI. It is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling early school leaving. There are currently 405 schools — 295 primary and 110 post-primary — participating in the school completion programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">With regard to curriculum reform, my Department's strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students. These strategies aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision through such programmes as the junior certificate schools programme, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, vocational preparation and training, VPT, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA.</p>

At present, the central vetting unit of the Garda Síochána processes requests for clearance from my Department for bus escorts and special needs assistants provided to children with special educational needs and to staff working in children detention schools. However, other employees and volunteers working in the education sector are not covered and I am aware that schools have experienced difficulties having other prospective employees vetted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">A cross-governmental working group was established to consider proposals for reform of vetting by the central vetting unit run by the Garda Síochána. Its terms of reference included defining the type of organisation which should come within the ambit of the vetting process. The group was chaired by a chief superintendent and included officials from the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General. The working group has submitted its final report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner and I have been informed that it is being given full and careful consideration with a view to early implementation as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">Considerable work has been done by my Department on the preparation of a draft discussion paper.

The issues involved do not relate only to my own Department and continuing co-operation between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science will be required in bringing forward reforms.</p>

            <p eId="para_1473">In circular 24/03, which issued to all schools in September 2003, my Department stated its intention to engage in discussions with representative interests with a view to developing a weighted system of teacher allocations for special needs teaching. Since then, significant developments have taken place and, in consultation with representative interests, a new system for the allocation of teaching resources for special needs in primary schools has now been approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">I am satisfied that the new weighted model of teacher allocation for pupils with special educational and learning support needs will significantly improve the level of service provided for such pupils. To facilitate the introduction of the new system, an additional 350 posts are being made available. This will bring the total number of such posts for pupils with low achievement and special educational needs to almost 4,500. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with learning support needs and those with higher incidence special needs, such as borderline mild and mild general learning disability and dyslexia. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with more acute needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">The general weighted allocation system will greatly reduce the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments and will put resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty over their resource levels. This will allow for better planning in schools, greater flexibility in identifying and intervening earlier with regard to pupils' special needs, as well as making the posts more attractive to qualified teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The previous allocation system placed significant demands on principals, teachers and psychologists. It has also proven to be time consuming, thereby delaying the allocation of resources for special needs. Action had to be taken to reform the system and the model now being introduced will, over time, significantly improve the capacity of the system to cater for children with special needs in a speedier, more effective way. The revised system will reduce the administrative burden on schools and allow them to concentrate on the delivery of services to pupils with special needs. It will also allow psychologists to devote more time to advising teachers on planning for individual children and for whole school provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">My Department has communicated with schools about their allocations. Permission will be given to fill all specific allocations immediately. The general weighted allocations will be filled following the determination of clustering and reallocation arrangements. To ease the transition to the new system, my Department has already agreed not to redeploy teachers from full-time posts via the panel redeployment process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1500">A range of actions are being taken to promote an increased uptake of science in second level schools, in line with the recommendations in the report of the task force on the physical sciences. In particular, important progress is being made in regard to curricular reform and inservice support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology, physics and chemistry; revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science beginning in schools in 2003-04; and work under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus. All of these developments are being or have been supported by national inservice programmes for teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">The following resourcing was provided: substantial grants issued to schools at primary level in 1999, 2001 and 2002; an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate; a capital grants programme for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment; allied with the announcement in 2003 of a once-off grant scheme, likely to cost of the order of €12 million, to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus. To date some 614 schools in the free education scheme have opted to provide the revised junior certificate science syllabus from 2003-04. Grants of €5.1 million were issued to these schools at the end of January 2004 and a further tranche of payments to certain schools is currently being processed. The revised junior certificate science syllabus provides for a more investigative approach to science education, with some 30 experiments and investigations which have to be carried out over the period of the programme. This hands-on approach is seen as critically important to enhance the attractiveness of the subject and encourage more students to choose the physical sciences at senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">There are ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative and there is the new TV scope programme in partnership with RTE, NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education. Other measures include provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path; reviews on mathematics, grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science, and initial reports on teacher training undertaken; awareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges linking with schools; the launch of the new discover science and engineering programme in October 2003 bringing together all the existing awareness activities in a unified strategy; the announcement by the Tánaiste in December 2003 of plans for Ireland's first interactive learning centre for children and adults, designed to give visitors a hands-on experience and understanding of science, and to be an education and outreach centre for teachers and pupils. The exploration station is due to open in 2006 and will be sited in the OPW Heuston Gate development in Kilmainham, Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_1505">The report by ESRI/NCCA examines the experiences of students in their first year at post-primary school. It shows that although students have both positive and negative feelings about moving to a new school, most students settle into post-primary school quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">Among the findings in the report are the possible negative effects that streaming of students by ability may have on how students settle into school. It is encouraging that the research indicates that the prevalence of streaming in first year is declining and that the great majority, 70%, of schools surveyed used mixed ability classes in first year, with 16% using banding and only 14% using streaming. We should keep in mind that "streaming" can take different forms and that sometimes different ability groupings may be helpful for the individual pupils at a later stage in their education: for example, various syllabi are available at higher, ordinary and foundation levels and it may be appropriate for classes to be organised along these lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">Schools have a certain amount of latitude in how they organise their classes and this is essentially an organisational issue for principals and school boards of management. The school development planning initiative, supported by a full-time support service, has an important role in achieving the best organisational arrangement for all pupils. In general, the view of my Department is that mixed ability classes are preferable, particularly in first year. This issue is dealt with through provision by the second level support service of whole school inservice on mixed ability teaching, through the work under the school development planning initiative, through the ongoing work of the inspectorate in evaluation and quality enhancement, and through dissemination of the findings of the ESRI/NCCA report. An information leaflet for schools and parents summarising the key findings and recommendations of the research has been launched and this will inform school practice and planning.</p>

            <p eId="para_1521">I am aware of the survey, conducted by the ASTI, referred to by the Deputy. It is important that, while acknowledging that student discipline is an issue in schools, we do not talk this up to being a crisis. It is undoubtedly the case that a small proportion of students cause serious problems in schools. The reasons for this are not simple and are societal as much as educational. That said, today's generation of young people is no more disruptive than its predecessors. The reality of the situation is that as we have progressively increased the retention rate in our formal education system, we are retaining students who in the past would have dropped out of school early. This poses challenges for schools and for society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">A school's code of discipline and the inclusive way in which it is framed is important, particularly in harnessing student and parental support. We also must look at whether the formal school model best meets the needs of all students and whether other models need to be developed. As against this, we must careful not to promote the exclusion of problem students as this will leave us with a greater problem down the road.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1524">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally. The board has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate services and educational welfare services and the necessary support and service delivery staff. The overall authorised staffing complement is 84, comprising 16 headquarters and support staff, five regional managers, 11 senior educational welfare officers and 52 educational welfare officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas, including areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and an educational welfare service is now available, for the first time, in the cities of Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny. Twelve towns with significant schoolgoing populations, 11 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">The board has also moved to provide a service to families who decide to have their children educated in places other than in recognised schools. A small number of people with the appropriate skills have been allocated to this work and assessments will commence shortly. My Department has recently issued guidelines to assist the board in meeting its responsibilities in this area. An information leaflet and an application form have issued to families who are educating their children at home. Work is also proceeding on the establishment of the register for 16 and 17 year olds who leave school to enter employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">As provided for under section 10 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, I have arranged for officials of my Department to work with the board to ensure that any opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes, whose work involves a school attendance element, are exploited to the maximum. I consider the implementation of protocols for such integrated working on attendance matters between the NEWB and, in particular, the home/school/community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the visiting teacher service for Travellers to be most important. When in place, these will assist the NEWB in carrying out its remit and ensure that all available existing resources are utilised to the full.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">The board has sought the first comprehensive data returns from schools regarding attendances and absences in the 2003–04 school year and these will assist it in keeping the level of need for the new service in particular areas under review.</p>

     the measures he has taken to address the serious issue of alcohol abuse among the student population.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1531">I am aware of the concerns expressed by teachers and parents regarding the issue of alcohol abuse among the student population. While education has a role in addressing the problem of the misuse of substances, particularly alcohol misuse, effecting change in this area also depends on consistent support from the drinks industry, parents and society as a whole. A responsible attitude to the promotion of alcohol, especially in targeting young people, and ensuring rigorous implementation of the law on legal age limits regarding the sale of alcohol are an essential part of this approach. Parents also have a responsibility in helping children and young people to adopt sensible and responsible attitudes and behaviours. In general the community as a whole needs to reflect on the general attitude to the misuse of substances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">Schools can play an active role in addressing the problems and consequences of the misuse of substances through the SPHE — social, personal and health education — curriculum which focuses on developing an informed and sensible attitude to substances. Through the SPHE curriculum, students are enabled to develop a framework for responsible and informed decision making about their health, personal lives and social development. In particular, the substance use module of the SPHE curriculum focuses on the issues relating to the use and misuse of a range of substances. While most young people are aware of the implications and consequences of misusing substances, the SPHE curriculum actively seeks to promote healthy and responsible choices by students in their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">All post-primary schools were required to implement the SPHE curriculum as part of the junior cycle core curriculum from September 2003. The 2003-04 return of pupil information from 743 post-primary schools indicates that all post-primary schools are complying with this requirement. Ongoing support in the implementation of SPHE continues to be provided to schools through the post-primary SPHE support service, which is a partnership between my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">Supports are also being provided to schools through the SPHE support service for the development of their substance use policies within which alcohol can be addressed alongside tobacco and drugs. Guidelines for developing a school substance use policy were prepared by my Department together with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards and circulated to schools in 2002 in accordance with action 43 of the national drugs strategy. The central objective of a school substance use policy is the welfare, care, protection and education of every young person. The school policy can ensure schools have a coherent framework for providing appropriate education and managing issues relating to substance misuse, including alcohol misuse, in a planned and considered way. In 2002, schools were asked by my Department to engage with the process of developing their substance use policies, if they were not already engaged with this process or if they did not have one in place already.</p>

            <p eId="para_1536">On 24 September 2003, together with my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I announced details of the membership and terms of reference for a working group on undergraduate medical education and training which has been jointly established to make recommendations on the organisation and delivery of high-quality training for doctors in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">The membership of the working group draws on a broad representation from medicine, academia, university, hospital and health board management and Government Department officials. The working group will examine and make recommendations on a range of aspects of medical education and training in Ireland. This will include the areas of course curriculum, teaching methods, interdisciplinary working and other issues relating to the organisation and delivery of undergraduate medical education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">The working group has been asked to consider and provide advice on issues arising from the recent Higher Education Authority, HEA, report that recommended a move to all-graduate entry for medicine and other health science disciplines. The report was commissioned by the HEA, at my request, on foot of a commitment in the programme for Government to address the issue of the distortionary impact of these high points courses on the points system. The report recommends that students should undertake an undergraduate programme of their choice in any area before taking a decision to enter medicine or one of the other health science disciplines. The other programmes in question are physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, pharmacy and radiography, all of which currently require extremely high points for entry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">The initial consideration by the recently established working group of the detailed implementation issues that arise for medical education will also inform my approach to the proposed later introduction of changes for the other health disciplines. I expect to receive the recommendations of the working group later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1541">In line with the commitment to tackle sub-standard school accommodation outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government, the level of capital investment in schools has progressively increased since 1998 to a total of almost €2 billion, the largest investment programme in the history of the State. This year my Department's school building programme of €388 million will deliver in excess of 260 significant school building projects at primary and post-primary level. In excess of 200 of these projects will commence on site in the current year, the remaining projects had commenced in previous years and are currently nearing completion. Furthermore, over 570 additional schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme directly by means of temporary accommodation, permanent accommodation and/or improvement works and all primary schools will benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">The challenge facing my Department is how to ensure the State gets best return on investment in educational infrastructure. New ways such as the devolved building initiative for small rural schools and the permanent accommodation initiative, both initiated in 2003 and expanded this year, show my Department's commitment to find innovative and flexible solutions to the difficulties faced by schools seeking to refurbish their buildings or to provide additional accommodation quickly. These schemes fund schools to respond quickly to accommodation difficulties. There is minimal interaction with my Department and schools are fully empowered to drive the design and construction process. I fully expect that these initiatives will inform future policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">My Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of underinvestment in school infrastructure. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme, which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing to tender in this year's programme, including this particular school. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in the agreed programme for Government.</p>

Post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses represent one such option. In dealing with the question of PLC numbers, the Department is not in a position to approve all the PLC places applied for in any particular academic year. A total of 40,733 places, for example, were sought nationwide for 2003-04 from a planned pool of approximately 28,500 places.

            <p eId="para_1547">It should be recognised that uncapped growth of the scale featured in the applications for PLC places may not be supported.

            <p eId="para_1550">I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 153 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">In circular 24/03, the Department stated its intention to engage in discussions with representative interests with a view to developing a weighted system of teacher allocations for special needs teaching. The allocation of an additional 350 teaching posts for special needs and a new system for the allocation of resources for special needs in primary schools have now been approved. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability and those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of giving children an even break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils. It is intended that the details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher incidence special educational needs and this will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in the higher incidence categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities. At present, there are no plans to establish an appeals process for the allocation of teaching resources under the new weighted system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">It is now proposed to devise clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. My Department will communicate with schools in this regard before the commencement of the coming school year.

            <p eId="para_1558">I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 151 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">A new physical education, PE, curriculum is being introduced into primary schools as part of the primary curriculum. It is planned that the new PE curriculum will be in place for the start of the 2006-07 school year. My Department is aware from recent media reports of an INTO survey on physical education facilities in primary schools. The issue of P.E. facilities in primary schools was one of a number of matters discussed at a meeting in June held between officials in my Department's planning and building unit and the INTO. At this meeting the INTO accepted that in the case of schools where such facilities were inadequate, a balance was required in the division of the funding allocation for the various sub-categories of the school building programme with appropriate priority being given to the provision of mainstream classroom accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">The provision of multi-purpose space for primary schools will continue to be considered within the design brief for new schools and/or renovation or extension school building projects. This is being done in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects. In terms of resources, the Government is delivering on its commitment to provide modern facilities in schools and has progressively increased funding in recent years, with an aggregate total of almost €2 billion being provided since 1998, the largest investment programme in the history of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">My Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of underinvestment in school infrastructure. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme, which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing to tender in this year's programme. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">With regard to the PE grant, I decided to withdraw payment of this in the light of the current budgetary constraints. The position will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process in the coming years. In addition to the specific grant referred to, both primary and post-primary schools can use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula, including PE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">My Department has no plans to conduct an audit of PE and sports facilities in schools. However, with regard to the proposed nationwide audit of sports facilities, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism intends to establish an interagency steering group shortly to commence work on developing a long-term strategic plan for the provision of sports facilities. One of the first tasks for this group will be to oversee the commencement of a national audit of sports facilities. Careful consideration will be given by this steering group to the scope of such an audit, in terms of the type, size and location of such facilities to be included.</p>

            <p eId="para_1570">I have not had discussions with the INTO on the issue of class size since last April. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 18.0:1 in the 2002-03 school year. The projected ratio for the current school year is 17.35:1. Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">I am committed to reducing class sizes still further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis having regard to available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.

            <p eId="para_1573">The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. As part of this process, the school planning section of my Department receives draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans from local authorities. These plans are monitored and, where necessary, meetings with local authorities are arranged to establish the location, scale and pace of major housing developments and their possible implications for school provision. Where appropriate, the local authority may be requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">The school planning section works closely with local authorities throughout the country and especially in the Dublin region in monitoring demographic changes and assessing the likely impact of planned new developments. In Dublin, a specific forum, the Dublin school planning committee, chaired by the school planning section, interacts with the Dublin local authorities. This forum comprises representatives of the local authorities in Dublin together with representatives of the patron bodies of primary schools and meets three times a year. This process of ongoing dialogue with the local authorities obviates the need for direct discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">The high cost of sites for schools, especially in rapidly developing areas of major cities, is a cause of major concern to me. I advocate the acquisition of school sites at no cost to the State but I realise that this a complex area. Ultimately, the acquisition of school sites at a reasonable and proportionate cost is a key objective of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1577">The adult literacy service is organised by and delivered through the vocational education committees throughout the country. The service is resourced and managed by the VECs, with funding from my Department. Funding for adult literacy has increased in recent years from just under €1 million in 1997 to over €19 million in 2004. Client numbers rose in the same period from 5,000 to 30,000 per year. The increase in funding has also enabled the introduction of special programmes targeted at groups with particular literacy needs. Such programmes include family literacy, literacy for deaf people and workplace literacy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">In the area of workplace literacy, joint initiatives have been developed at local level through co-operation between the vocational education committees, FÁS, the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and local employers. Funding has been provided for a course in workplace basic skills training for experienced group literacy tutors in the VEC service. The course is designed to familiarise the tutors with key issues in basic skills training in the workplace and also identifies strategies for the introduction and implementation of programmes in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">Programmes under way at national level include the return to education programme, which is a joint initiative between FÁS, VECs and NALA, which provides an intensive literacy programme for community employment workers on FÁS community employment schemes. In addition, a focused workplace literacy programme, jointly funded by my Department and the local authority national partnership group, is available nationwide for local authority outdoor staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">The commitment and support of employers is a fundamental requirement for the successful implementation of workplace literacy programmes. In seeking to support and encourage employers to participate in such programmes, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has approved a project proposal from NALA to design and deliver a workplace basic education programme for SMEs. A pilot programme for the development of a certificate in workplace skills has also been approved by that Department under the ESF-aided in-company training measure of the human resources development operational programme.</p>

Failure by me, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance to discharge our duties to make the necessary resources available for the implementation of this Bill could very well give parents who are affected grounds for a judicial review to ensure that resources are provided.

            <p eId="para_1601">In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy is a principal and one mainstream post based on an enrolment of 12 pupils at 30 September 2002. The enrolment in the school at 30 September 2003 was ten pupils. The agreed figure for the retention of the one mainstream post is 12 pupils.

            <p eId="para_1605">My Department has not carried out a survey for the purposes outlined in the Deputy's question. However, in line with action 32 of the National Drugs Strategy 2001 to 2008, my Department arranged for the implementation of the "Walk Tall" and "On My Own Two Feet" drugs education programmes in all primary and post-primary schools, respectively, in the local drugs task force areas during the school year 2001-02. These task forces were set up in the areas experiencing the highest levels of illicit drug use, in particular the areas where heroin abuse is most prevalent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">Schools play an active role in addressing the problems and consequences of the misuse of substances, including drugs, through the SPHE, social, personal and health education, curriculum which focuses on developing an informed and sensible attitude to substances. Through the SPHE curriculum, students are enabled to develop a framework for responsible and informed decision making about their health, personal lives and social development. In particular, the substance use module of the SPHE curriculum focuses on the issues relating to the use and misuse of a range of substances. While most young people are aware of the implications and consequences of misusing substances, the SPHE curriculum actively seeks to promote healthy and responsible choices by students in regard to their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">All post-primary schools were required to implement the SPHE curriculum from September 2003 in line with action 33 of the national drugs strategy and as set out in my Department's circular M11/03. The 2003-04 return of pupil information from 743 post-primary schools indicates that all post-primary schools are complying with this requirement. Ongoing support in the implementation of SPHE continues to be provided to schools through the post-primary SPHE support service, which is a partnership between the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">Supports are also being provided to schools through the SPHE support service for the development of their substance use policies. Guidelines for developing a school substance use policy were prepared by my Department, together with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, and circulated to schools in 2002 in accordance with action 43 of the national drugs strategy. The central objective of a school substance use policy is the welfare, care, protection and education of every young person. The school policy can ensure that schools have a coherent framework for providing appropriate education and managing issues relating to substance misuse in a planned and considered way. In 2002, schools were asked by my Department to engage with the process of developing their substance use policies, if they were not already engaged with this process or if they did not have one in place already.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1616">As the Deputy will be aware, differing funding arrangements have historically applied to the three sectors at second level. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding. There are, however, significant differences in the approaches to the funding of back-up services, such as for secretaries and caretakers. The Government and its predecessor have removed some of the anomalies and the process continues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">The standard <i>per capita</i> grant for voluntary secondary schools has been significantly increased in recent years and now amounts to €274 per pupil as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. For disadvantaged schools, the increase has brought the <i>per capita</i> grant to €312 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">These significant increases build on my commitment towards enhanced equalisation funding measures for voluntary secondary schools. In addition to the <i>per capita </i>grant of €25 that was introduced under the school services support initiative for second level schools in September 2000 and now stands at €99, secondary schools have benefited from further increases bringing the grant for such schools to €131 per pupil from January last. This <i>per capita</i> grant is in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools. For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to additional equalisation funding of almost €30,000 per annum and overall additional support services funding of approximately €80,000 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. As the funding provided under the schools support services fund is flexible, schools are permitted discretion as to the manner in which support services are provided. In particular, it allows schools with difficulties in provision for secretaries and caretakers the additional funding to make a meaningful impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that by comparison with 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives extra annual funding of over €105,000 per annum. I am committed to improving further the funding position of voluntary secondary schools in light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity highlighted by the voluntary school sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1623">I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 152 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">I wish to advise the Deputy that Irish sign language, ISL, has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998 and that my Department has given practical effect to that legislative recognition through a series of initiatives, outlined below, which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system for the deaf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">My Department has provided resources and implemented a number of initiatives over the last number of years to promote the use of Irish sign language in the education system. It has established an advisory committee on the education of the deaf to examine all relevant matters in the education of the deaf and hard of hearing, including making recommendations for the promotion of ISL in the education system. A deaf person was chosen to chair this committee and a number of deaf representatives are also on the committee. I have asked this committee to report to me by October 2004. The special schools for the deaf in Cabra, Dublin, have been encouraged in regard to the use of sign language in classes. All teachers now receive ongoing inservice training in the use of ISL which is funded by the teacher education section of my Department. My Department has sanctioned and funded the employment of deaf people as special needs assistants, SNAs, in the schools for the deaf in Cabra who act as communication support workers in classrooms and as role models for deaf pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">It should be noted that the number of sign dependent profoundly deaf pupils is a relatively small proportion of the total number of deaf and hard of hearing pupils in the education system generally. My Department has provided funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf schoolgoing pupils to provide training in ISL for deaf children and pupils, their siblings and parents. The value of ISL has already been acknowledged in the Education Act 1998 and my Department has sanctioned a pre-school for deaf children on a pilot basis for five years until June 2007. The personnel in the pre-school deliver a programme through the medium of Irish sign language as a first language.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">Funding is also provided for ISL classes for immediate relatives of the children attending the facility. My Department, through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has established and fully funds a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College, Dublin, which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. Funding is provided for the Link UP project which delivers literacy training to deaf adults in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1629">On 15 July 2003, I signed the Church of Ireland College of Education order. The purpose of the order is to reserve 32 places in the first year of the Bachelor of Education degree course in the Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines, for students who are members of the Church of Ireland or who belong to the broad Protestant tradition. The making of the order and its laying before the Houses arises from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and is designed to ensure that the rights and interests of the college, schools with a Protestant ethos, and the students in those schools are provided for.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">Teachers who have trained in another member state of the European Union, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by the Department of Education and Science but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in national schools. During this period of provisional recognition these teachers are required to work towards meeting the Department's Irish language requirements and to prepare for the Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge. I anticipate that it will be easier for students to gain this qualification, on the basis of my announcement in April in regard to changes in the structure of this exam. These changes include a reduction in the overall pass mark to 40%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">I would, however, point out that as part of the minimum academic requirements specified by my Department for entry to primary teacher training courses provided in the colleges of education, all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a grade C in higher level in Irish in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent. This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student's proficiency in Irish. My Department considers it to be the minimum standard in Irish necessary for students entering a teacher training course which will equip them to teach Irish to pupils at all levels in primary schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1636">In recognition of the difficulties third level students can experience in obtaining accommodation and following consultation with third level colleges, a special tax incentive was introduced to encourage the provision of dedicated student residential accommodation in section 50 of the Finance Act 1999. The Act provides for relevant guidelines to be issued by the Minister for Education and Science in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">I assure the Deputy there is no discrimination in regard to third level students with disabilities. My Department was very conscious of this in drawing up the guidelines by ensuring that disabled access and the provision of accessible bedrooms was incorporated in developments. In this regard, developers are required to provide a minimum of one out of every 50, or part thereof, of the total number of bed spaces, for students with disabilities. The study bedrooms must be fully wheelchair accessible and complete with <i>en suite</i> bathroom facilities. The residential accommodation must comply with Part M of the Building Regulations 1997 which sets out the legal requirements in regard to access to and use of building facilities by disabled persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">The guidelines define an "educational institution" as an institution in the State which provides courses to which a scheme approved by the Minister for Education and Science under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992 applies or an institution which offers an approved course for the purposes of tax relief under section 474 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The National Training and Development Institute, NTDI, does not fall within these definitions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">The guidelines define a "student" as a person who is a registered student of and is pursuing a course of study on a full-time basis at an educational institution. Apprentices attend institutes of technology for a maximum of 13 weeks on each of two phases of their four year apprenticeship and are, therefore, not regarded as full-time students as defined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">A review of the guidelines is currently being conducted by my Department in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Finance and the issues raised by the Deputy will be considered in the context of that review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1642">I recognise that high quality early education prior to entry into formal schooling can lead to lasting social benefits that persist throughout life, both for the individual and for society. Research also indicates that early childhood education is particularly beneficial for children who are disadvantaged and for children with special needs. Parents, too, can benefit significantly from involvement in early education through improved self confidence and better relationships with their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">The Early Start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk during 1994 and 1995. The Early Start service has not been expanded since 1995.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">In regard to future development of early childhood education provision for disadvantaged children, my Department, as part of a detailed review of educational disadvantage programmes, is currently exploring how such provision should best be delivered in the future. I am particularly concerned to ensure that any future actions by my Department in this area are based on a collaborative approach with other Departments involved in the overall early childhood care and education, ECCE, sector. Meeting the overall objective of providing the best possible service to the communities and children involved requires that any educational provision by my Department takes account of child care measures under the remit of other Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645">The future development of the Early Start pre-school project is being considered as part of this process and I will make an announcement in this regard as soon as the detailed review of all initiatives to tackle educational disadvantage has been completed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1647">Several actions have been taken by my Department that will have the effect of reducing waiting times for assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">My Department has established the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. Provision of individual psychological assessments is part of the work of the educational psychologists in NEPS. The psychologists do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are dealt with in chronological order. School authorities refer children for assessment and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologist's visits. This allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and such children will be seen or referred on in a matter of weeks, if not days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">In order to add value to the psychological service, NEPS is pursuing a policy of enhancing the skills of teachers in the areas of group and individual testing, programme development and behavioural management. This means that many children's needs can be speedily met without the necessity for individual psychological assessment, although the psychologists are available as consultants to teachers and parents, thus helping the children in an indirect way. This is also having the effect of reducing waiting times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">NEPS is being developed on a phased basis over a number of years and has not yet reached its full staffing complement. Pending expansion of its service to all schools in the country, my Department has allocated funding to NEPS to allow for the commissioning of psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS has issued details of how to avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments to all schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">There have been concerns in the past that some children may have been referred to more than one agency, thus increasing the waiting lists in schools and in health board clinics and leading to a duplication of effort. A joint working party, established by NEPS and the health boards, reported during 2002 with a series of recommendations aimed at promoting effective liaison at national, regional and local level. This report has been accepted by the relevant management groups and will now be implemented. It includes recommendations for effective protocols in regard to referrals and waiting lists and is the third initiative aimed at reducing waiting times for assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1652">My Department has been aware for some time that a substantial proportion of referrals for psychological assessment were made in order that children might be identified as eligible for additional resources to meet their special educational needs. I have recently announced the introduction of a new method of allocating such resources to schools, the weighted system. It is clear that children with certain categories of special educational need are so prevalent that every school may be expected to have to meet their needs. I have, therefore, introduced an automatic resource allocation to all schools, based on school population and expected prevalence of special educational needs. These resources may be assigned to individual children by the school authorities without the necessity for individual psychological assessment. Although there will always be a need for some individual psychological assessments, this initiative will lead to a marked reduction in waiting times for assessment and will allow NEPS psychologists more time to advise schools on the identification of children who need additional resources.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1654">In 2003, I received requests from a number of governing bodies of institutes of technology for approval to apply the student service charge to defray the costs of registration, examinations and student services, to students enrolled on FÁS apprenticeship courses. The institutes argued that a <i>pro rata</i> charge should be levied on apprentices on the basis that they avail of the full range of services provided to students in the institutes. The institutes considered that it was unfair to levy the charge on full-time students only, as this gave rise to a situation whereby full-time students were effectively subsidising apprentices through their contributions toward the cost of providing student services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">The institutes also pointed out that, unlike other categories of student, apprentices receive wages and either a travel or an accommodation allowance while studying in the institutes. Nevertheless, the institutes have indicated they are prepared to consider reducing or waiving the charge in cases where it would cause hardship to apprentices or their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">Following consideration of the case made by the institutes of technology, I decided to approve the introduction of a <i>pro rata </i>student services charge for FÁS apprentices from January 2004. I understand the majority of apprentices have paid the charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">Having regard to the question of the dispute over institutes withholding examination results from apprentices who have not paid the student services charge, the position is that institutes of technology are statutory bodies established under the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992 and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992. Under those Acts, the governance and day to day activities of the institutes are matters for which the governing bodies and the management staff of the institutes are responsible. This includes matters in regard to examination results. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1665">There were some 39 recommendations in the report of the task force on the physical sciences, with costed proposals totalling €244 million extra, of which €66.3 million is a recurring annual cost. Funds are not available at present to progress the strategy on the scale recommended in the report. Of the 39 recommendations, four are not for the education sector. Of the remainder, progress has been made on 25 of the recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">In particular, important progress is being made in regard to: curricular reform and inservice support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology, physics and chemistry; revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science beginning in schools in 2003/04; and work under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus. All of these developments are being or have been supported by national inservice programmes for teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">Substantial grants issued to schools at primary level in 1999, 2001 and 2002. There was an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate; a capital grants programme for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment; and the announcement in 2003 of a once-off grant scheme, likely to cost of the order of €12 million, to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus. To date, some 614 schools in the free education scheme have opted to provide the revised junior certificate science syllabus from 2003/04, and grants of €10.1 million were issued to these schools this year. The revised junior certificate science syllabus provides for a more investigative approach to science education with some 30 experiments and investigations which have to be carried out over the period of the programme. This hands-on approach is seen as critically important to enhance the attractiveness of the subject and encourage more students to choose the physical sciences at senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">Progress has also been made on ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative and the new Scope TV programme in partnership with RTE, NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education. Materials and publications have been provided to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path. Reviews on mathematics have been undertaken and changes made to the grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science, and initial reports on teacher training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">Awareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges have been linked with schools. The launch of the new Discover Science and Engineering programme in October 2003 brings together all the existing awareness activities in a unified strategy. In December 2003, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced plans for Ireland's first interactive learning centre for children and adults, designed to give visitors a hands-on experience and understanding of science, and to be an education and outreach centre for teachers and pupils. The exploration station is due to open in 2006 and will be sited in the OPW Heuston Gate development in Kilmainham, Dublin. This work continues to be progressed and enhanced as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forfás and industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and progress to third level options in this critical area as a vitally important part of the national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1672">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 became fully operational with effect from 5 July 2002. This Act provides for the repeal of the previous school attendance legislation under which responsibility for the enforcement of school attendance rested with four local authorities in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford and the Garda for the remainder of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">Under the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board was established to ensure every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare focused services to children, families and schools. It has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate services and educational welfare services and the necessary support and service delivery staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas, including areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and an educational welfare service is now available, for the first time, in the cities of Limerick, Cork and Kilkenny. Twelve towns with significant schoolgoing populations, 11 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">The Act provides that a parent may be prosecuted where the board forms the opinion that he or she is failing in his or her duty towards a child's education. This is a step of last resort after every possible step to improve attendance has been taken and where the board feels that a prosecution will bring about change. I am informed by the board that the practice and procedures for taking legal proceedings are being developed at present and it is intended that they will be in place from the commencement of the next school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1680">My Department's policy in regard to the retention of young people who are at risk of early school leaving is to support young people in school and to support schools to adapt to the needs of the young people experiencing difficulties. It also involves the development of a range of appropriate interventions in the community to support pupils, who are still of compulsory schoolgoing age and are outside the formal school system, with a view to supporting their progression over time back to mainstream education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">The school completion programme, SCP, which was introduced in 2002, is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. Eligible schools were selected on the basis of their retention rates from the Department's post-primary pupil database. Schools are grouped into 82 clusters of one or more second-level schools and their major feeder primary schools. To date, 405 schools have been included in the SCP, 110 post-primary and 295 primary, with six post-primary schools and 22 primary schools participating in County Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">With regard to curriculum, my Department's strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students, which aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision and meet the needs of the diversity of pupils in our second level schools, by expanding funding for programmes such as the junior certificate schools programme, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, vocational preparation training, VPT, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">In addition, the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, was established under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education. The board has recently written to all primary and post-primary schools requesting an annual attendance report for the school year 2003/04 which will provide comprehensive data on the levels of non-attendance by pupils. Such data are essential for the planning of the development of the National Educational Welfare Service and for the development of services and programmes designed to prevent non-attendance. My Department will be guided by any recommendations and advice on school attendance and early school leaving received from the NEWB following an analysis of the annual attendance data.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">At present, there are no plans to build a further third level institute of technology in County Donegal. The north west region is currently served by two third level institutes of technology, namely Letterkenny Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology, Sligo, in addition to the Tourism College, Killybegs. It is deemed that these institutions provide adequate provision of third level places for the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1692">Day to day responsibility for the administration and enforcement of occupational safety and health legislation, including the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act 1987 and the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) (Emergency Procedures) Regulations 1991, made under that Act, is a matter for the Health and Safety Authority. I am informed by the Health and Safety Authority that the company referred to in the question owns two fixed production platforms/installations in the Kinsale Head gas field.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">I understand the company has recently tendered to have a single self-relieving dual purpose standby/supply boat vessel. I am informed there is one certified temporary standby vessel capable of carrying supplies and cargo available. When a crew change is needed at a platform, which is usually every two to three weeks, the certified standby boat will come out from port and replace the original standby vessel while it goes into port to change crew and get supplies. This temporary standby boat will be certified to be a standby vessel. The Health and Safety Authority has informed me that this arrangement will satisfy regulation 13 of the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) (Emergency Procedures) Regulations 1991, as at all times there will be a certified standby vessel in the vicinity of both platforms, which are approximately three nautical miles from each other.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">Regulation 13(1) of the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) (Emergency Procedures) Regulations 1991, relating to standby services, requires that there shall be on hand at all times, except when prevailing weather and climatic conditions may endanger the crew, passengers or vessels, in the neighbourhood of every offshore installation a suitably equipped standby vessel, prepared to render immediate assistance in the event of an emergency on, in, at or about the said installation or involving persons working from the said installation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">Regulation 13(2) requires that a written risk assessment be made of the geographical limits within which the standby vessel may manoeuvre so as to operate safely and effectively and satisfy the provisions of Regulation 13(1). Regulation 13(4) requires that a copy of the risk assessment be made available to an inspector on request.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">Health and Safety Authority inspectors carry out periodic inspections of offshore installations to ensure compliance with relevant occupational safety and health legislation. I am informed that the authority has not had occasion, to date, to seek a copy of the particular risk assessment in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1800">EU enlargement on 1 May saw Belarus become a direct neighbour for the first time. Belarus now has a land border with three members of the Union, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. As a result contacts with Belarus have never been so close and the Union's relations with Belarus have never been so important.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">During the Irish Presidency enlargement was underpinned by several important initiatives. These included the adoption of a neighbourhood policy for the new neighbours and an intensive review of the Union's relations with its neighbouring states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">The period of the Presidency coincided with a significant deterioration in human rights in Belarus, an increased repression of the opposition, the media and civil society, and the intensification of a peaceful democratic struggle in the country. The EU's three goals were: to maintain the EU's Presidency led dialogue with the government of Belarus to encourage basic democratic reform; to maintain pressure on the Belarusian Government to end repression of human rights groups, the opposition and the media; and to ensure that the people of Belarus benefit from the incentives and funding that will become available under the European neighbourhood policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">A number of meetings with the Belarusian political opposition were held in the course of the Presidency. A meeting at official level took place in the US embassy in Minsk during the first ever joint EU-US mission to Belarus in March. Its purpose was to underline EU and US concern about the human rights problem and to encourage the administration to embark on a series of reforms. During the course of the mission the Presidency, on behalf of the EU, invited a number of the opposition leaders to visit Brussels. The visit was co-funded by the Irish and Swedish Governments and lasted from 24 to 26 May. Leading figures from Belarusian human rights organisations were also included in the Belarusian delegation. An allocation of €15,000 was made available towards the cost of the visit. Travel costs were shared by the Swedish and Irish Governments. Ireland also co-funded interpretation costs, local travel and subsistence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">The opposition leaders also met Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State at my Department, in Brussels. He acted on behalf of the Presidency. They also met Commissioner Verheugen and the High Representative-Secretary General, Mr. Solana. Deputy Kitt's discussions with the delegation were positive and conducted in a frank, open and friendly atmosphere. Members of the Belarusian delegation underlined the need to increase EU assistance for civil society and to maintain pressure on the government in Minsk on a range of issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">Deputy Kitt confirmed that the EU was ready to engage in a constructive dialogue with Belarus to promote common values. He stressed that it was vital, in the period leading up to the forthcoming elections, that the opposition parties consolidate their efforts to provide a genuine democratic alternative for the people of Belarus. He underlined the EU's deep concern at the deteriorating human rights problem. He also confirmed that the EU insists that an independent investigation be held into the cases of the disappeared and the early release of political prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">Ireland does not believe that Belarus should be isolated from the international community. I was pleased that the ENP conclusions, that were agreed by the Union's Foreign Ministers in June, confirmed that it would be possible to extend the full benefits of the ENP to Belarus when it established a democratic form of government, following free and fair elections. I was particularly happy that the Council confirmed its intention to strengthen support for civil society in Belarus under the ENP and to examine possibilities for further supporting the humanitarian needs of the people of Belarus, including addressing the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">As regards contact with the President of Belarus and his government, I wrote twice to the Belarusian Foreign Minister, in my capacity as President of the Council of Ministers, on specific human rights cases. My first letter concerned the attempted closure of the European Humanities University in Minsk. My second letter was on the harassment of the Belarusian Helsinki Committee and its president, Mrs. Tatiana Protko. I was particularly pleased that the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, joined me in making representations in the latter case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">During our Presidency we broke new ground in co-ordinating EU policy with the US Government's policy on Belarus. This was witnessed by the joint EU-US mission to Belarus and co-operation with the Secretary of State on human rights issues. We have also regularly raised the human rights problem in Belarus as part of our dialogue with Russia. I have no doubt that the initiatives that were taken during the Irish Presidency will be developed during the Netherlands Presidency so that the democratic transformation of Belarus, that we all wish for, can be further advanced.</p>

            <p eId="para_1829">The distribution of this year's schemes of student support has been earlier than last year. They were issued to the awarding bodies in early July.

            <p eId="para_1830">The following is a copy of my press release on Sunday, 27 June, for the Deputy's information. I announced full details of the increases in the reckonable income limits and various rates of maintenance grants under the terms of the 2004 schemes.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1831">The Minister for Education and Science, Noel Dempsey, T.D, today reaffirmed his commitment to the promotion of equitable access to higher education, on the issuing of the 2004 student support schemes to the awarding bodies, the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees. Minister Dempsey stated that in line with the principles which underpinned the €42m package of student support measures provided for the 2003/4 academic year, this year's schemes are giving particular priority to addressing inequities in participation of students from the lower socio-economic groups through the Special Rates of Maintenance (Top -Up) Grant. There will be a significant increase of 18.6% in the "Top-Up" element for the 2004/5 academic year. The higher, non-adjacent rate has been increased to €4,855 an amount based on the maximum personal rate of Social Welfare Unemployment Assistance. The adjacent rate has been increased to €1,945. These rates represent ‘top-ups' on the ordinary grant of €1,910 and €765, respectively. The annual income threshold for the special rates of maintenance grant has been increased by 6.8% to €14,693, ensuring that at least 10,000 students will benefit. Minister Dempsey said that an increase of 2.0%, in line with inflation, is being provided for in the ordinary maintenance grant to give a maximum grant of €2,945 in the 2004/05 academic year. The reckonable income limits for these grants have been increased for the 2004/05 academic year in line with the increase in the average industrial wage, as has the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education. The top income limit has been increased from €40,000 to €42,360, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the Student Service Charge of €750. It is anticipated that up to 56,000 students will benefit as a result of the full range of increases announced. Minister Dempsey said: — "I have continually highlighted, as a key Government priority, the need to promote and facilitate equitable access to education including, in particular, higher education. Support has to be targeted at those who are most in need and at an appropriate level. The improvements which are being effected in this year's schemes are giving effect to this objective and are central to its achievement." The Minister said that he is also taking steps, including consultations with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, to ensure that students will be aware of the financial assistance available. The Minister thanked the CAO for agreeing to issue an information leaflet to all CAO applicants in the coming weeks.</p>

This means that pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability and learning support needs are included. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">The weighted allocation will be made as follows. In the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of giving children an even break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater that 30% boys, there will be one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, there will be one for every 200 pupils. I intend for the details of the new model to be set out in a comprehensive circular. It will be issued to schools for the commencement of the new school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher incidence special educational needs. It will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in the higher incidence categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">My Department proposes to devise clusters of allocations under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in that context and the weighted arrangements. My Department will communicate with schools in this regard before the commencement of the coming school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1867">My Department is committed to providing a full educational psychological service to all schools. Over the past few years the National Educational Psychological Service has expanded gradually on a national basis in accordance with the Government's decision of February 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">It was envisaged that approximately 180 psychologists would be employed in NEPS by the end of the five year development period. Notwithstanding the time consuming aspects of recruiting professional staff, there are 130 psychologists in NEPS, including three on career break. Since Easter four psychologists have taken up posts. They will be assigned to schools after they have completed an induction course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">The psychological service has not reached its full staffing complement and, therefore, it cannot offer a service to all schools. In County Kildare approximately 67% of pupils at both levels have access to the service. This is the typical situation in many counties. NEPS psychologists and administrative staff are included in my Department's overall staffing complement. The future recruitment of psychologists must be dealt with in that context. I cannot say when the service will be fully staffed even though it remains a priority for my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">An element of the service is the provision of psychological assessments, where needed. During its development phase some schools experienced difficulties in accessing such assessments. I funded schools that did not have direct access. They can avail of the scheme for commissioning private assessments that NEPS administers. The organisation circulated details of SCPA to all schools and full information is also available on my Department's website. The scheme is an interim arrangement and is not a substitute for a full educational psychological service. Such a service provides a wide range of supports for schools, including assessments.</p>

My Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of under investment in school infrastructure. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme, which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing to tender in this year's programme. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.</p>

My officials are reviewing all projects which were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme, with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005 onwards. As part of this process, consultations were held with the education partners about the prioritisation criteria used for large scale building projects. The purpose of these consultations is to ensure that the criteria have optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of the primary and post-primary sectors. The revised criteria are being used to frame the multi-annual programme. I expect to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1880">It is my intention that all applications for special educational resources received by 30 June 2004 will be responded to before the commencement of the 2004/05 school year. Applications for resource teacher support received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 for which a response is outstanding have been considered and schools have now been notified of the outcome which indicates to schools what resources may be put in place immediately. Applications received after 31 August 2003 and by 30 June 2004 will be processed in the near future and the outcome will be notified to schools before the commencement of the 2004/05 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">The teacher allocations involved will be made in the context of a new weighted system which I announced recently. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability, and those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1882">The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools as per the urban dimension of the programme, giving children an even break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils. It is intended that the details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1883">The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher incidence special educational needs and this will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in the higher incidence categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities. My Department proposes to devise clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. The Department will communicate with schools in this regard before the commencement of the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1884">Schools which have applied for special needs assistant support will be advised of the outcome of their applications as soon as possible in advance of the next school year. Account is being taken of existing levels of special needs assistant support allocation in schools. In cases where a reduction in the level of special needs assistant support is proposed, there will be provision for schools to appeal, having regard to the care needs of the pupils concerned. My Department is considering applications submitted by schools for the establishment of special classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1899">The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools as per the urban dimension of the programme, giving children an even break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with high incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900">It is intended that the details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year. The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with high incidence special educational needs which will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in the high incidence categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with low incidence disabilities. My Department proposes to devise clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. The Department will communicate with schools in this regard before the commencement of the coming school year.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1967">The foster care allowance can only be paid in respect of children who are taken into the care of a health board under the Child Care Act 1991 and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care Regulations 1995.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">In 1998, the then Minister of State in the Department of Health and Children set up a working group on foster care. The task of the working group was to make recommendations on all aspects of foster care. The report recommended that all payments made in addition to the basic foster care allowance should be abolished and that the basic allowance should be increased. In line with the report, the foster care allowance was substantially increased in August 2001 and all discretionary payments were abolished. There are only two instances where discretionary payments may still be considered — educational fees, excluding expenses such as books, school uniforms, school trips and so forth, and medical expenses not covered by the general medical scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">The issue of relative care was dealt with in detail in the 2001 report of the working group, entitled "Foster Care — A Child Centred Partnership". The report sets out a number of basic principles that should guide placements with relatives. These are: that the best interests of the child are paramount; that the child should be placed only in an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment; that the standard of care must be equivalent to that provided in a traditional foster care arrangement; that relative placements should only be made where a secure attachment exists or has the potential to develop between the child and the relative concerned; that a partnership approach should be used in developing skills and supports for relatives providing foster care; that placements should not be made as a means to provide income support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1970">The working group considered the possibility that some children are placed in the care of the health boards in order to provide income support for the family of the child. The group was strongly of the view that such a practice would be highly inappropriate. Income support is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and those in need of such support should contact that Department. The working group stated that children should only be brought into the care of the health boards if they meet the criteria regarding the need for care and protection set out in the Child Care Act. In addition, the choice of placement of any child in the care system should be based on the particular child's individual best interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">Under the current legislation, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">In view of the consideration given by the working group on foster care to the issue of relative care my Department has no current plans to review the Child Care Act 1991 or the Child Care Regulations 1995 in this regard.</p>

The board, in consultation with its European colleagues, has continuously monitored the safety of the class of medicines known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, since they were first licensed for the Irish market. The board has taken regulatory action on these products when deemed necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">Most recently, the board took part in a Europe wide review of medicinal products containing paroxetine, which is one of the group of SSRIs which is used to treat mild to moderate depression and which includes Seroxat. This review was undertaken on the basis of safety concerns relating to these products. The board actively participated in this review, which involved a complete benefit/risk re-assessment, and concluded that the benefit/risk profile of products containing paroxetine remains positive. A number of recommendations were made for inclusion on the product's licence documents, the purpose of which was to harmonise the information on these products across member states. The majority of these recommendations are already reflected on the licence documentation currently approved in Ireland. This documentation includes special warnings and precautions for use, particularly about the need for close monitoring of patients using medicinal products containing paroxetine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1976">The board will continue to actively monitor the safety of all medicinal products licensed for use in Ireland, evaluate all new scientific data that emerge and take any regulatory action deemed appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2014">The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority and the local authority concerned, in this case, Kilkenny County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_2015">With regard to the Piltown-Fiddown bypass, I understand from the NRA that the scheme was opened to traffic in February 2002 and involved the realignment of 9.3 km of single carriageway, bypassing Piltown and Fiddown. The project contains three road bridges and one railway bridge and 13 junctions to cater for traffic using local roads. The scheme was constructed in accordance with applicable design standards for national roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">Design standards for national roads are kept under review by the NRA and are updated, as appropriate, at intervals. The current design standards were comprehensively reviewed and updated in 2000. The Piltown-Fiddown scheme, which had been planned and approved prior to publication of these standards, was reviewed in the light of the updated standards to assess the need for incorporation of ghost islands. The latest standards require that consideration be given to providing such islands in circumstances where minor road traffic flows exceed 500 annual average daily traffic or where other conditions so warrant. Following a review of the junctions on the Piltown-Fiddown bypass ghost islands were provided at Owning Road and Rathmore Road.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">At-grade road junctions such as those on the Piltown-Fiddown scheme are a common feature of the road network throughout the country. Road users must exercise due care and caution when approaching or using such junctions. Road design standards seek to reduce the risk of accidents at such locations and generally provide for measures to improve definition in an effort to enhance safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">Four fatalities have occurred on the bypass since 2002. I understand that driver behaviour was a contributory factor in these cases and that a truck driver has been charged with dangerous driving in connection with the fatal accident on 18 June 2004. I also understand that specific junction design features and the absence of ghost islands at certain junctions is not regarded by the NRA to have been a significant contributory factor in the case of the fatalities that have occurred having regard to the particular circumstances involved in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2019">The NRA is, however, arranging to review the safety situation on the bypass. As part of this process, the NRA will liaise closely with the Garda Síochána and Kilkenny County Council and will revisit accident reports as part of the effort to identify possible additional measures that could further reduce the risk of accidents attributable to road design.</p>

            <p eId="para_2027">The person in question, a 21 year old non-EEA national, made a visa application in March 2004 for the purpose of coming to Ireland for a period of about three months. The application was refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa. In particular, it was felt that the applicant had not displayed evidence of any obligations to return home following her proposed visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">It was noted that the applicant named a reference in Ireland on her visa application form, and that he would provide for all her funds and accommodation for the proposed three month visit. However, no evidence was provided with the application to show that the applicant and her reference had ever met.</p>
            <p eId="para_2029">An appeal against the refusal, which included a letter from the Deputy, was received in my Department on 20 May 2004. Although the Deputy stated in his letter that the applicant owned a farm in Thailand, no evidence of this or any other commitments was submitted with the application. The visa appeals officer considered the application afresh and upheld the decision to refuse the application. On 28 May 2004, a letter to this effect issued to the applicant's reference in Ireland. The letter also indicated that if the applicant still wished to travel to Ireland she should make fresh visa application with up to date supporting documentation. The applicant was not informed that she could not re-apply for a visa, as suggested by the Deputy in the details provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_2033">Under section 6A of the Guardianship Of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987, an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including directions as to custody and access. In addition, the section provides that the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for orders on custody and access. Section 3 of the Act provides that, in deciding on an application relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">I believe the existing provisions, which I have outlined, strike a good balance between the interests involved. In particular, they provide that, where a mother does not consent to the appointment of the father as guardian, he may apply to the court to be made a guardian. Even if he is not a guardian he may still apply to the court for custody or access. The overriding point is the weight which the court is obliged to give to the welfare of the child under section 3 of the 1964 Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_2057">The definition of an orphan for the purpose of orphan's pension and orphan's allowance was extended in 1995 to include children where the parents are still alive but have abandoned or refused or failed to provide for them. This was seen as a necessary response to changes in family and social circumstances. I am aware of concerns raised in recent times by social workers and representative organisations about the appropriateness of the titles of these payments. Any change would involve legislative change to the social welfare code. I am keeping the matter under review for further consideration in the context of future social welfare legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">At present, the weekly rate of the orphan's contributory allowance and maximum rate of orphan's non-contributory pension is €107 per week. This is a substantially higher rate of payment compared with other payments made by my Department in respect of children. The foster care allowance paid by the health boards is paid at a rate of €289.50 per week, per child under 12 years of age, and €316.50 per week, per child of 12 years and over. Foster carers operate within a very specific framework; they are subject to rigorous scrutiny and ongoing monitoring by the health boards and the children in their care are subject to a care plan. This means that foster carers have additional responsibilities and duties in respect of the children in their care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2059">The two payment systems have significantly different objectives and purposes and I do not consider that there is a case for standardising payments in this area.</p>
