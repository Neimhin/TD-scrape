#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	0	In September 2004, Deputy Brian Cowen was appointed Minister for Finance.  In accepting the seal of office as Minister for Finance, he undertook to defend the interests of the Irish taxpayer and to protect the stability of the Irish economy in so far as that was possible.  Yesterday, we saw the culmination of the stewardship of the Taoiseach.On 24 April 2008, a month before he became Taoiseach and in his capacity as Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen attended a private dinner organised by his good friend, Mr. Drury, along with Seán FitzPatrick and the board of Anglo Irish Bank at a restaurant in Dublin.  At that stage, because the IMF report was on his desk indicating that the property situation in Ireland was about to burst, he knew, because he had extended the facility for loans in respect of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority site, that Mr. FitzPatrick and others were both on the board of the authority, as pointed out by Deputy Hogan, and on the board of Anglo Irish Bank.  The Taoiseach also knew of the difficulties that a senior investor in Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Seán Quinn, was having in respect of shares as the Taoiseach and the regulator had been informed of that.All of this took place during the Taoiseach's tenure as Minister for Finance, when his duty was to defend the interests of the Irish taxpayer and to protect the stability of the Irish economy.  It is the Taoiseach's view that Anglo Irish Bank was systemic to the Irish economy and he spoke to those bankers about the Irish economy.  At the private dinner in 2008 with the board of Anglo Irish Bank, did the Taoiseach discuss these issues with the board and these bankers?  Did he ask questions that a good Minister for Finance should ask in respect of what was a situation clearly beginning to spiral out of control, and which culminated yesterday in the Taoiseach and his Government imposing an extra debt of €50,000 on every family in the country which they did not ask for, did not cause and for which they are not responsible?  It is the Taoiseach who is responsible.

I always did and always will defend the actions of Government in the past.

I want to make it clear that this has no relevance whatever to this situation.The situation Deputy Kenny wants to raise concerning the challenge to liquidity in the banking system, which subsequently turned into a serious problem on 28 September, as we saw, was dealt with by me on the basis of the best possible advice available to me at all times.  I reject the contention the Deputy continues to make.  I take full responsibility for my decisions——

What we were seeking to contend with, as, indeed, was the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, was an issue regarding liquidity challenges in the Irish system.  That was well known and well documented at the time.  Therefore, I do not accept for one moment this idea that Brian Cowen is personally responsible for the collapse of the banking system in Ireland.

I do not accept the contentions made by Deputy Kenny and I treat them with contempt.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Taoiseach will not take any other proposition from any other quarter except his own.  He comes to the House this morning having imposed a levy — an extra debt of €50,000 — on every family in the country through what he did yesterday.  He said the meeting he had in his capacity as Minister for Finance had no relevance to this situation.  That is the same thing his predecessor said when he addressed a meeting in Manchester as a citizen as distinct from being a Minister.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	26	For heaven's sake.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	28	My charge is not against Brian Cowen, citizen.  It is against the Taoiseach in his capacity as Minister for Finance.  He attended a private dinner organised by a person who was then a member of the board of Anglo Irish Bank and was dealing with risk competition in the bank.  He met those bankers and he knew there were difficulties in the property sector because of the IMF report on his desk.  He knew of the dealings of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority because he extended borrowing facilities to them.  He knew from the Financial Regulator of the difficulties with a senior investor in Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Seán Quinn.  Yet this function, one of many functions the Taoiseach attended, had no relevance to the Irish taxpayer or the Irish economy, whom the Taoiseach, in his capacity as Minister for Finance at the time, was expected to defend.The situation with regard to Anglo Irish Bank is deteriorating on a continuing basis.  The published element of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report told us that the extent of liability was about €3 billion, then it became €6 billion.  Yesterday, the Government injected €8.3 billion into the bank and we are told of a further €10 billion on top of that.  To boot, the Minister for Finance has said that may not be all.  The cost of dealing with what the Taoiseach considers is not just a systemic bank but one that is very close, guarded and protected by the Taoiseach and his party, is rising on a consistent basis——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	29	A question, please Deputy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Taoiseach can treat this with contempt if he wishes——
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I do.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	32	That is the Taoiseach's nature.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	33	It is not my nature; it is the truth.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	34	He also treats the citizens of this country with contempt because he has levied their sons and their daughters for the next generation with a burden they did not cause and for which they were not responsible.  In view of the lack of regulation and oversight by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance and now as Taoiseach, he has caused this cataclysmic financial consequence for every person in this country.  How does he defend protecting the interests of the Irish taxpayer and protecting the stability of the Irish economy in his time to date as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach, when it is clear he oversaw this spiralling and out of control situation and when he has asked the taxpayer to take on the private debts organised and raised by Seán FitzPatrick and his crew?

When I became Minister for Finance in 2004, I made my first budget speech for the 2005 budget a couple of months later.  I set up a tax strategy group and reviewed all the property reliefs, etc.  I used independent consultants, Goodbody and others.  The tax strategy group and all those papers are on the website——

He is the gurrier in chief when it comes to that sort of thing.I will not have my integrity challenged here by Deputy Kenny or the guilt by association he is trying to impute.  When I became Minister for Finance in 2004, I set up such a group.  Those papers are in the public domain and they can be found on the website of the Department of Finance.  They set out at that time how we were going to deal with a situation where we had to move from the dense tax structures relating to property developments.  It is all laid out on the website how we might arrive at a soft landing position where growth of 4.5%——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Let us get the facts clear.  In autumn of 2007, we had a major problem with regard to liquidity in the international system.  The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and everyone else including the Central Bank of Ireland, were working in the context of trying to ensure we could maintain liquidity in the system.  This is all documented for anyone to see.  By autumn 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, there was a solvency crisis at that point because the whole banking system was broken.  The investment banking model was broken.  The regulatory system that applied then was no longer appropriate, as we have now seen from the response of every other jurisdiction.  Almost every other country has had to recapitalise its banks.  Every other country has been involved in having a state guarantee——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I want to make a distinction and I will defend my position as Minister for Finance with anyone.  I continue to take, as every Government should, full responsibility for its actions at all times but I am not going to take the revised version of history coming from Deputy Kenny who had an even looser fiscal policy framework to put to the Irish people when he sought this job at the last election.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	47	We gave the Government an economy in surplus and they blew it.

I was the person who refused to take all that advice from Fine Gael which it regarded as an opportunity to win middle class votes in the general election.  Those are the facts and I will not take the revisionism that Deputy Kenny is coming up with and I will not take the attack on my personal integrity that is part of Deputy Kenny's whole strategy for dealing with this matter.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	51	The people of this country are in a state of shock this morning and somewhat bewildered by the huge size of the figures and scale of the amount of money that will have to be paid for the bail-out of Anglo Irish Bank.  I saw a figure this morning of €200,000 million a year in the budget.  This is the sum of all the cutbacks that have taken place in health, education and social welfare.  We are being told it could cost up to €40,000 million to keep Anglo Irish Bank going and the Taoiseach says it could cost even more to wind it up.  The reason we are between such a rock and a hard place now over Anglo Irish Bank is because the Taoiseach provided a State guarantee for it.On 28 September 2008, the day before the State guarantee was brought in and which included Anglo Irish Bank, that bank was a private bank.  The Taoiseach could have told anyone who had invested in that bank or purchased bonds in it or loaned it money they had made an unwise business decision and that they would have to take the consequences or at the very least, if there was to be State intervention at that stage, that the State would have been in a position to negotiate with those bondholders.  Instead, the Taoiseach told them not to worry about it because the State would look after it and the taxpayer would pay.  He wrote a blank cheque for them.  Yesterday, the details of that blank cheque were filled in.I can understand the case for a State guarantee for high street banks and building societies but I have never been able to understand what is the case for the State guarantee and the nature and extent of that guarantee provided to Anglo Irish Bank which, after all, was a piggy bank for property speculators.  The Taoiseach has stated he made that decision on the best possible advice.  Earlier this year, he refused a motion from the Labour Party for an investigation or an inquiry into how that decision was made to provide such a guarantee to Anglo Irish Bank and for which we had to pay up yesterday.Will the Taoiseach release all of the papers and all the advices available to him in September 2008 when he and his Government decided to provide a State guarantee for Anglo Irish Bank?  Will he tell the House who lobbied on behalf of Anglo Irish Bank in advance of that decision being made?  Will he tell the House why a decision was made, as I asked at the time, to include dated subordinated debt in that extensive guarantee?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	52	In regard to yesterday's decisions and how they were portrayed, the capital that is being provided by the Government to the banks involves, first, the conversion of preference shareholdings in AIB and Bank of Ireland.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	58	No, if I may say so, Deputy Gilmore's introduction suggested it is a question of paying out €2 billion per year with nothing to be gained from it.  In respect of the capital we have provided, we set out a promissory note arrangement over ten years.  In return for this, we have the shareholdings in the bank and the assets that have been bought by NAMA.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	62	It paid €8.5 billion for €15 billion in loans and it expects to recover the value of those loans over its seven to ten year lifetime.  That is the purpose of the NAMA operation.  Elements of this morning's debate seem to suggest that we are handing over money to the banks and getting nothing in return.  We are getting assets to the value of the bonds we are giving to the banks over that period.If the Deputy asked anyone, including present and past governors, they would say Anglo Irish Bank was of systemic importance.  I am not simply saying that; it is acknowledged.  The Deputy does not acknowledge it and argues instead that it should have been let go to the wall.  He has just heard that if we had not guaranteed Anglo Irish Bank on that occasion and it went to the wall with a disorderly failure in the system, the result would have been a contagion throughout the entire system because of the interconnectedness of our banks.  It was not a case of letting something go to the wall without consequence.  We were not in a position to take any risk in regard to the financial system.  The financial guarantee provided us with the means by which we could avoid an implosion in the banking system in Ireland.  The Deputy might not want to accept that but it is a fact.  That night's decisions were made on the basis of advice from and discussion with the relevant people, including the Governor of the Central Bank, Department of Finance officials and regulators.

We made the decisions on that and no other basis.In regard to the question of what else was involved, we made the decisions that night and the discussions continued until the early hours of the morning.  It was not a question of me getting papers.  It was a case of examining the situation and asking what was the challenge to the system on that occasion, what needed to done and whether the Government was prepared to act.  We had to take those decisions and I believe they were the right ones because the advice of the people to whom I referred was that the financial system was at risk.  I was not prepared to take that chance and no responsible person in our position in government at the time would do otherwise.  The suggestion to the contrary is simply not true.

He leads us to believe that the decision was taken in the national economic interest.  Nothing I have heard since September 2008 convinces me that was the case.  I believe that the Taoiseach and the Government made that decision in September 2008 not in the best economic interest of the nation but in the best personal interests of those vested interests who I believe the Government was trying to protect on that occasion.

I believe that is why the decision was made and I have heard nothing to the contrary since then.  That is why I am asking the Taoiseach to publish all the advice he had available to him on that occasion.  If my belief is correct, and I have not been convinced to the contrary, that decision was an act of economic treason for which this country is now paying very dearly.Yesterday, we got a very big bill for Anglo Irish Bank.  That rotten institution acted as a piggy bank for property speculators, was described in strident terms by the Minister for Finance as having been reckless in the manner in which it conducted its business and has caused the huge problem we now face in our economy.  We will get the new unemployment figures in a few minutes.  People have lost their jobs as a result of this.  This bill is equal to the sum total of the pay cuts and pension levy in the public sector.The responsibility is on the Taoiseach to explain why it was necessary to provide Anglo Irish Bank with the extensive and broad guarantee that has now landed us in a situation whereby it will cost €40 billion to keep it going and even more to wind it up.

As I will be making a statement to the House later today, I will confine myself to giving a summary account of the proceedings now.The meeting discussed a new European strategy for growth and jobs, often referred to as EU 2020, which is intended to improve Europe's competitiveness in light of increasing global competition.  The draft strategy is consistent with Ireland's efforts to move towards a smart economy with innovation and sustainability at its core.  The council agreed the five headline targets for the strategy which centre on labour force participation, educational attainment, research and development, climate change and sustainability, and poverty reduction.  I will elaborate on these in my statement later.There are different views on how best to measure poverty fairly.  As a result, we agreed that we would have to come back to this target, as well as that on education, at our June meeting.  The elaboration of the strategy, including the setting of national targets and implementation arrangements, will be the subject of intensive work at several sectoral councils in the coming period.  It is intended that the European Council will sign off on the strategy at its meeting in June.The European Council discussed competitiveness and there is a considerable focus throughout Europe both on competitiveness vis-à-vis the external world, as well as relative competitiveness giving rise to imbalances among member states.  The issue of competitiveness is at the heart of the EU 2020 strategy.  The Heads of State and Government also discussed the situation surrounding global climate change negotiations following the disappointing outcome at the summit in Copenhagen last December, and agreed on a number of steps intended to support those negotiations.Further to the statement agreed at the informal European Council meeting of 11 February, the Heads of State and Government of the eurozone countries concluded that, should it prove necessary, all eurozone member states would contribute assistance to Greece by means of bilateral loans, and that this would occur alongside significant support from the International Monetary Fund.  The availability of this mechanism, which is heavily conditional, is intended to ease the pressure on Greece as it seeks further funding in the market place.  I have arranged for a copy of the agreed statement by the Heads of State and Government of the eurozone countries, which sets down the arrangements, to be laid in the library of the House along with the conclusions of the spring European Council.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	115	What is the Taoiseach's response to Social Justice Ireland's assessment of the European Council's failure to set targets for poverty reduction and educational disadvantage?  The Social Justice Ireland commentary on the European Council meeting concluded that European leaders seem to be abandoning the most vulnerable people in Europe.  Let us consider the draft EU 2020 strategy presented by the Commission to the council.  It set very modest targets indeed but it was not even accepted.  It was overturned and rejected by the Heads of Government in favour of what Social Justice Ireland has described as meaningless aspirations.Does the Taoiseach agree with the European Anti-Poverty Network that this sends a remarkably negative message about our commitments, that of the Taoiseach and the Government and about the EU's purported desire to tackle poverty and social exclusion given that 4.2% of our population live in consistent poverty, 14.4% live in relative poverty and, at present throughout the European Union, some 84 million live in relative poverty?  How does the Taoiseach explain the failure on his part and that of the Irish representation and the European Union to act against this very sorry set of statistics?  It is very important because sometimes the view is that job creation of itself is the entire panacea for the issue of tacking poverty.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that some 30% of those here living in poverty have jobs?  They include the heads of households who are at work but they are living in poverty because of the low-pay circumstances in which they work.Does the Taoiseach not accept that a more complex and broad response is required to truly tackle all causes of poverty?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that a poverty reduction strategy with binding periodic targets enforced by the European Union with at least the same vigour with which it pursues its economic goals should have been adopted at the European Council meeting last Thursday and Friday?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I do not accept that the EU is unmindful of the need for social cohesion.  As part of the fundamental objectives of the union there is a cohesion policy to provide for a socially inclusive society and one which is economically dynamic and which can provide standards of living, jobs and a quality of life for the European Union.  We must do this in the context of a very competitive world trading environment.  From a consideration of world investment patterns it is clear Europe has much work to do if it is to deal with some of the disadvantages it has in terms of demographics vis-à-vis other parts of the world.  Social costs will increase inevitably and we must improve and increase the potential of our human capital.  People must be able to create greater productivity and wealth to fund the increased social costs that will inevitably emerge as we try to maintain the political, social democratic model that is at the heart of the European Union.In that context, the 2020 strategy is being devised in an effort to learn from the lessons of the Lisbon Strategy, where there were many targets and many, as they call them, score sheets on a range of criteria, which unfortunately became a box-ticking exercise in some respects rather than looking at having a better outcome with fewer targets.  The President of the Commission outlined that one would have these five targets but underneath that one would have flagship initiatives by the European Union cutting right across all of its area of activities in social and economy policy to help achieve these targets.  It would not be a question of setting targets, letting matters flow along and hoping that one reaches them.  It is an integrated strategy that is trying to minimise the number of targets — five, as have been outlined.Deputy Ó Caoláin mentioned one of them, coming specifically to his question on poverty reduction.  There is a need to look at more than merely the initial indicators that were set out in the draft, and we suggested that.  We felt further work should be done on it.  They have agreed that further work will be done so that we can try to ensure the poverty reduction target can be met.  Therefore, more work is to be done between now and the June Council to satisfy Heads of State and Government that there is a sufficient level of work done that would convince us that we would be more likely to achieve it than simply using it based on the information we have at present.  Far from it being dismissive of some of the social objectives set out in Lisbon 2020, the fact that more work needs to be done on it is an indication of the need to have a robust and rigorous analysis of that aspect of the targets no more than one would have on the more strictly economic ones.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	117	There is nothing in the Taoiseach's response, in what I have been advised of the European Council engagement last week or, indeed, in the commentary from Social Justice Ireland and others such as the Anti-Poverty Network, that gives me a sense that he utilised his opportunity of representing us at that Council meeting last week to press for a robust anti-poverty strategy.  Ireland is not playing the part that it can and should.The Taoiseach will respond in his own words, but the fact of the matter is I fear that he is leaving it to the big wigs to make all the decisions.  What objection did the Taoiseach raise to the rejection by the Heads of Government of the draft 2020 strategy presented by the Commission?  They were basic propositions.  Why could that not have at least been accepted instead of being rejected for what have been widely described as meaningless aspirations in the commentary by SJI since?Ireland has not played the part that it must on the European stage in seeking to put robust targets in place.  Only a week before the European Council meeting, in a written response to parliamentary questions from the Sinn Féin team, the Taoiseach indicated that Ireland supports inclusion of a target to capture progress towards greater social cohesion.  The precise position he would adopt, the Taoiseach went on to state, would depend on what emerges from the ongoing analysis and preparatory discussions.  That gives me no confidence that the Taoiseach was going there with a clear purpose and intent to argue the position cogently and forcefully.

With so many other voices looking over the work apparently done over the last two days of the past week, these were not good days work in the interest of people who are suffering at the margins of our society and the European Union community.  Does the Taoiseach realise that if we do not take this lead, a position that he, the Government and this country can take within the European Union, certainly we cannot depend on some of the other member states to provide the answers?  They will not do it.  It will need leadership from countries such as ours.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that we should be to the fore in demanding the most stringent targets over a ten-year plan with reviews at periodic points along the way to ensure that the targets are being met?  Can he give us any hope that he will approach this issue with the robustness and determination that it quite clearly requires?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	120	As I explained to the Deputy, this issue was raised by our delegation and others.  This was a work-in-progress discussion the Heads of State and Government were having and it was agreed by everybody that further work was needed in this area.  The fact it was highlighted and such work will now take place is an indication that there was not a dismissive attitude being taken to this target no more than other targets.  Much official work will be ongoing and Ireland will make its views known.We have had our own national anti-poverty strategy.  The basis upon which these European Union strategies can work is that we need to reflect them as well in national strategies.  The total budget of the European Union is less than 2% of total spend in budgets throughout the European Union.  National governments have a considerable responsibility to try to integrate the strategies outlined at EU level with national budgets and priorities.  Mr. Felipe Gonzales, the former Minister of Spain, who is chairman of the reflection group and who attended the dinner that night and spoke on this question, made this point, that it is important when there are EU strategies that national strategies tie into them.  Otherwise getting the outcomes that one expects is less likely unless one applies the resources, the far greater proportion of which are spent at national level than at European level.On the question of legally binding targets, one is outlining a strategy here.  There are directives and various other legal instruments in the implementation of strategies during the course of the period between now and 2020 that can be considered in terms of how one improves the lot of those who are at the lower end of the income scale, but I do not envisage the strategy going into that sort of detail.  The strategy must outline the orientation, priorities and general direction in which we can take Europe forward, and how would that feed into subsequent debates on the budget review, etc.On our own situation, for example, at the meeting I highlighted the fact, which was reflected in the conclusion, with total support from President Sarkozy after I made the intervention, that when one is looking at the future of Europe and providing more jobs in Europe, the biggest manufacturing industry in the European Union is the food and drinks industry, which depends for its primary source of production on agriculture.  It is almost getting to be the case in some quarters that one cannot mention agriculture as if one is some hidebound dinosaur from the past who should not be mentioning probably the one effective common policy the European Union enjoys at present.  We have competitive advantages in that area and certainly within the European system of agriculture, we ourselves have competitive advantages vis-à-vis other European countries.  Whether in food safety, environmental sustainability, the future of rural communities, maintaining indigenous industry, providing for research and development tranches to go into that industry as well as the more esoteric bio-tech, bio-pharm and other such industries, we want to ensure that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water in terms of new strategies.  It would not make sense, in any corporate review or in any company looking at what it needs to do for the future in the context of a more trading environment, to decide that the business at which one is biggest within one’s own operation, that is, in terms of manufacturing, should no longer be a fundamental part of how one will compete in the future.  That was strongly reflected in the conclusions.At these work-in-progress meetings, pending the June Council meeting, Ireland makes its voice heard and seeks to make an input to ensure a balance is achieved that not only reflects our priorities but makes sense of the European strategy.  There is no point in attending them simply to make a national case.  If it can be shown to be in the interests of Europe generally, one is likely to get greater support at the summit table.  The new format for European Council meetings, with just Heads of State and Government around the table, allows for better interaction and political debate than in the past when there were large meetings which tended to be more pro forma and scripted.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	121	At a recent European People's Party meeting, which several Heads of Government attended, much concern was expressed about the Greek economic situation and how it had got so far out of line.  Germany and France broke the Stability and Growth Pact several years ago.  Accordingly, the general feeling was there was little point in imposing financial penalties on a country in serious financial difficulties arising from the condition set out in the pact.It was reported from the recent European Council meeting that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, commented on the possibility of a requirement for a European monetary fund, similar to the International Monetary Fund.  As the Taoiseach is aware, this would require another treaty.  I do not think anyone here wants to get into that again.  What is the Taoiseach's view on this proposal?In addition to the loans Greece may receive from the IMF, will the Taoiseach inform us as to how much Ireland will be expected to contribute to a bilateral loan for Greece and what conditions will attach to it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	122	There was no request from Greece for funds before the Council.  This meeting was a follow-up on the February Council statement which said it would provide support for Greece.  That was to satisfy the markets from which Greece is trying to obtain funds.  Greece wishes to handle this matter itself as a sovereign state and it is taking tough measures to do that.  There was no request before the European Council for support for a fellow member state.  Instead, there was a request for the Council to devise or indicate what mechanisms would come into play as a matter of last resort should such a requirement arise.The statement from the European Council sets that out clearly in the interests of showing solidarity in the Union and that it is serious about defending its currency.  That is important for Ireland, even if the problem pertains to Greece or another member state.  Any attack on the currency is an attack on the whole zone of stability the euro represents.We indicated, as did all other member states, the basis on which we would be prepared to assist should a request come.  I refer Members to the statement by the European Council which sets out the mechanism as distinct from the idea we were committing specific amounts of money.  We indicated the majority of assistance would come from Europe but would include the participation by the IMF.  That represented a compromise from previous views expressed prior to the Council meeting by various Heads of State and Government, notably Germany's.There is also an agreement to have work completed by the end of the year to ensure such a situation does not arise again.  The economic difficulties that arose in Greece during its change of government were because the real public finance position was different from what had been submitted to the European Commission.  That cannot happen again.  Every member state needs to know each other's true economic position.Speculation is idle on how the Stability and Growth Pact should operate with excessive deficit procedures and what carrot-and-stick approach should be adopted until this detailed work is done by all member states.  It will be at the end of the year when we will know from ECOFIN and the European Council precisely what amendments are needed for the pact.  The question will then arise whether there needs to be an amending treaty.  We all hope it would be possible to provide the necessary rigour and improvements to the system without such an amending treaty.  I cannot anticipate the outcome until we see how the situation develops, it is resolved and what is regarded as a proportionate response to the developments with which we are contending.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I support the protection of the euro.  I listened to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, describe what might trigger leaving the euro, a view I do not share.Greece has to re-finance serious loans due shortly.  It will have to borrow €53 billion this year to re-finance debts that are expected to rise to €290 billion.  The Council's decision has given a stay to allow some sense of stability to be brought back to the Greek position, and as a consequence, to the eurozone.As the level of debt and borrowing requirements for Greece will become evident in the next eight months, was there a view at the Council meeting that the strategy adopted will be able to deal with it?  Will the member states agree to some conditions attaching to a bilateral arrangement with Greece?  Has a framework being worked out if, at the request of Greece, the IMF will have to give it serious financing while the other member states do so in proportion to their capacity?  Has a detailed framework for Ireland's contribution, one that would be repaid with normal interest conditions, been sent on to the Taoiseach subsequent to the meeting?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	124	First, Greece has not requested such an outcome.  Should that eventuality occur, the European Central Bank and the European Commission would work out what conditionality they regard as appropriate and necessary which would then be put to the Council.  Tables have been set out outlining the nature of our contribution.  It would not be a question of each member state deciding what conditions it would put on such a loan.  The Council, if it came to it, would then decide to formally adopt such a decision.The point made after last week's meeting was about the nature of the mechanism and how it would work should it be required.  Coming to the amounts involved and the conditionality, that will be based on a composite proposal by the ECB and the Commission to the Council for consideration.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	125	What is the Taoiseach's estimate of the amount Ireland will contribute in the event Greece draws down the loans from the EU and the IMF?  I understand the figures amount to €15 billion of EU money and €10 billion from the IMF.  There is speculation in some newspapers that Ireland's contribution will be in the order of €250 million.  Is that speculation accurate or close to the mark?Regarding the quid pro quo Chancellor Merkel sought in return for the package from Greece — strengthened powers of supervision from the EU over the finances of member states — what is the view of the Taoiseach?  Does he agree or is he opposed to it?  My understanding is that as a country we were opposed to any such role for the European institutions in respect of the finances of individual member states.Regarding the 2020 strategy, my understanding is that each member state must draw up a national programme to set out in detail the action taken to implement the strategy.  The live register figures have just been published and are in excess of 435,000 for March, the tenth successive month in which the live register figure has been over 400,000 and it amounts to 65,000 more than this time last year.  Apart from the European agreement on the matter, this is of some urgency.  Of the Government members, who will be responsible for drawing up that programme and when is it likely to be presented?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	126	In the aftermath of the strategy being adopted at EU level, national programmes are devised thereafter.  We are in the process of discussing the European strategy and the national programme will be devised in the aftermath of decisions adopted by Europe.  The general thrust of the strategy proposed, considering the importance of research, development and innovation, is in line with the consensus approach nationally to the general direction the economy needs to go in terms of export-led growth, providing more prospects for business, developing more business and having a good entrepreneurial environment in order to create jobs and get entrepreneurs to come up with ideas to provide the goods and services of tomorrow that provide the jobs of today and tomorrow.  I do not have a fundamental problem with the general orientation of the strategy but obviously there are issues, such as those I have mentioned in previous contributions here, which we will highlight.  This is so there will not be an understanding that those industries are being relegated or not part of the future of Europe.  If the question is what is the national strategy that comes after the adoption of the European strategy currently under debate, dealing with employment is part of the European approach.  We will look to Europe to assist to complement the efforts we are making to provide a greater degree of social inclusion in society.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	127	This time last week, prior to the trip to Brussels for the summit, I raised the issue of whether the Taoiseach would make a statement or enter into discussion in the Dáil on his intentions at the summit, particularly in respect of the eurozone and Greece.  Where this country commits a certain amount of money for the Greek bailout, which we understand to be €250 million, it is imperative that there is some discussion in this House prior to that move.  In the future can we adopt the same position adopted by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs whereby the Minister for Foreign Affairs comes before the Joint Committee on European Affairs?  The Taoiseach should come before a plenary session of the House prior to the summit where important decisions are being made, important positions are to be taken by the Government and commitments are made in respect of finance.  The Taoiseach should give the House some opportunity to hear his position and his intentions and give Members the opportunity to express views on the matter.The target of 25% poverty reduction by 2020 is the subject of non-governmental organisations throughout Europe exercising the citizens' initiative.  They are collecting 1 million signatures in order to put it on the agenda for the Commission.  Is it not desirable that over the next ten years, from now to 2020, the national reform programme includes that as one of our targets and objectives?  We should include in it a statement on overseas development aid and whether we would meet the target.  We have less than 0.5% at the present time despite having had a commitment to 0.7%.  We should at least include that in the 2020 strategy.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Taking the last point first, the economic and social strategy of the EU does not get into the detail of overseas development aid commitments, even though the European Union is the largest contributor of overseas development aid in the world.  I do not envisage that point being incorporated into the strategy.  That is not to say it is not an important issue but it is not part of the parameters of discussion in respect of this aspect of European policy for the future.Deputy Gilmore raised the point that there is a capital key in the order of 1.2% and if the figure mentioned by him was the total amount to be raised, it would be in that ballpark.  We must show solidarity with colleagues in the Union and that involves everyone taking on national responsibility as well.  I do not have a problem with the statement issued by the European Council in respect of the mechanism mentioned.  We will not have a situation where the lending state will pay more.  If we are borrowing money at X%, the state to which we lend money will have to cover the X% as well.  Costs are covered.  The state provides the money but ensures the interest costs are recouped in the repayment arrangements by the state one is assisting.  That is an important point when people are considering this matter.  Technical arrangements have been devised to allow that to happen.  Without going to the detail, it is a point I want to make for the purposes of clarification.Regarding the preparations for the European Council, the General Affairs Council is the Foreign Ministers Council and is the Council that still has a requirement under the treaties to prepare the content and agenda items of the European Council meetings.  I suggest, therefore, that the Foreign Affairs Council, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continues to be utilised by any committee seeking to know what is emerging on the agenda of a European Council meeting prior to the holding of such meeting.  Members will be aware that agenda items are often overtaken by events.  A debate held one particular week might not be relevant to what emerges the following week.  An example is the Greek situation, discussion on which again took place at the European Council owing to the emergence of an agreement on the mechanisms.  This discussion took up the first part of the meeting.  Having a prior meeting does not necessarily mean one gets an accurate reflection of what will take place at a forthcoming meeting.  I believe the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs remains the best forum for that type of interaction between Parliament and the Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, together.In answering these questions I am interpreting "working groups" as groups which are working towards completion of particular projects or tasks rather than groups which meet on a continuous or ongoing basis to provide strategic direction.As part of the transforming public services agenda, a working group, chaired by my Department, has been established to develop proposals for reducing barriers to information sharing between different parts of the public service.   Proposals developed by this group will be submitted for consideration to the Cabinet committee on transforming public services.  This is the only working group chaired by my Department.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	130	How often does this working group meet and is there a regular arrangement in regard to its meetings?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	131	In respect of particular projects, it would meet reasonably regularly.  The level of work involved would dictate how regular it meets.  I do not have with me the dates in respect of the meetings of that working group but I can obtain them for the Deputy.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Does the senior officials group on social inclusion still exist?  My understanding is that group is chaired by the Taoiseach's Department and part of its brief is to maintain a broad overview in regard to social inclusion issues and to bring emerging topics to the attention of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will outline its current status in terms of, if it continues to function, when last it met and when it will meet next.  The Taoiseach might also state whether developments in regard to the misuse of illegal drugs and the growing dire effect the drugs scourge continues to have on communities comes within its broad remit.  Was this group consulted before the cuts which threaten the national drugs strategy were imposed?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	133	As I outlined in my reply to Deputy Gilmore, I have interpreted "working groups" as groups working towards the completion of projects or tasks rather than to groups which meet on a continuous or ongoing basis to provide strategic direction which, for example, would include the senior officials group on social inclusion.  If the Deputy tables a specific question in that regard, I will be able to provide a more specific response and dates in regard to meetings and so on.  I do not have that information to hand.  I did not interpret the question in that way.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 8 and 9 shall be decided without debate; and the proceedings on No. 21 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 85 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements shall be confined to the Taoiseach and to the main spokespersons for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin, who shall be called upon in that order, who may share time, and who shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, a Minister or Minister of State shall take questions for a period not exceeding 20 minutes and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply, which shall not exceed five minutes.  The suspension of sitting under Standing Order 23(1) shall take place at 1.30 p.m. or on the conclusion of No. 21, whichever is the later, until 2.30 p.m.  Private Members' business shall be No. 72, motion re special educational needs, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after three hours.

I have two questions for him.  Has the Government made any arrangement in respect of the proposed children's referendum?  Is it likely to be held this year?  Perhaps the Taoiseach will outline the position in that regard.While we argue in this House in regard to the various positions we adopt in respect of policies and so on——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I am coming to it.  Is the Government prepared to bring before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service or the Dáil the options it considered in respect of the bail out of Anglo Irish Bank?  Would it be appropriate that we have a mechanism for independent assessment of the propositions put forward by Government, Fine Gael and Anglo Irish Bank so that Members of this House will have at their disposal truth and fact in regard to the judgments that have been made?  In the interests of what has happened and the extent of the liabilities here, it would be an exercise which deserves that kind of scrutiny.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, will meet senior officials after Easter to discuss what sort of recommendations can be made to Government in respect of the first matter.  I do not accept the continuing argument made by the Deputy about the relative merits of his proposal because it has been proven, on a fairly consistent basis by reputable people, that his banking policy is not a credible alternative.  That has been confirmed.

The Taoiseach indicated yesterday that some agreement would be made by the Whips for questions and answers some time tomorrow.  The Labour Party is anxious that it should be more of a question and answer format.  I understood, from what the Taoiseach said yesterday, that what he had in mind was continuing statements with a number of questions at the end.  It is important that it is a question and answer format in order that the detail of what was announced yesterday can be teased out more fully.  I see the Taoiseach will respond with enthusiasm to this suggestion.

When will that legislation be introduced?I draw the attention of the Taoiseach to the fact that in the schedule of sittings which has been published there is provision for a week in early June when there would be no sittings.  That week normally coincides with the holding of a referendum.  Last year, it coincided with the holding of local and European elections.  Am I to draw from the fact that it is on the calendar that it is the intention of the Taoiseach to hold the three by-elections in the first week in June?

One of the great things about trying to be generous with time here is that people always have further suggestions which go beyond what was originally proposed, but that is the nature of the game.  The idea was that tomorrow would provide an opportunity for others to make statements in the House through the statements format, at the end of which the Minister for Finance would make himself available for some questions and answers for, I suggest, half an hour.  The Whips can decide on it but it is not a question of having a series of questions and answers.  Deputies want to have an opportunity to contribute to the discussion and should be allowed to have that opportunity.  We can then provide for questions and answers at the end.  It is a matter for the Whips to finalise, but that was what was envisaged.

The Labour Party was only given short briefings an hour or two before the announcements yesterday.  During the Minister's speech we were given the blue book about NAMA, but there are very many unresolved issues in it, including the valuations attached to what are described as investments and hotels which were not dealt with in the statements yesterday.  People are struggling to cope with the horror of what the Government unveiled yesterday but we need answers to what is in the blue book.

That is quite shocking because the taxpayer is taking on a doubling of the national debt.  What the Taoiseach did yesterday could cost us 5 cent extra in income tax——

Does the Government intend to afford time in the Chamber to debate the agreement?  It has no guarantees that there will be no further cuts in social welfare.  It has no provision to rule out any further cuts to the public services delivered by public servants.  There are a whole range of issues which Members here would like to address to the respective Ministers and the Taoiseach.  Can the Taoiseach indicate to the House his intention regarding the agreement which was reached, its current status and when he expects to know with certainty its future?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The matter has been referred to the constituent unions for their consideration and they should be given the time and space to do that.  Obviously, on the basis of its ratification, it will become an agreement which will be operative.  It is open to the House in due course for the Whips to arrange for a debate.  We need to enable the Whips to discuss it, while being mindful of the fact that this matter is now being considered by employee representatives.

I note the spokesperson for the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said the Bill will make hunting deer with a pack of hounds an offence on the grounds of public safety.  It might apply to the members of the Taoiseach's party in recent times regarding this issue.  When is the Bill likely to be published?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I understand we are awaiting publication.

The floods directive has to be transposed into Irish law and will make the Office of Public Works the competent authority for that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, gave a commitment after Christmas that secondary legislation would be published and signed by the end of this month.  Is it still the intention of the Government to have it signed by the end of the month?  When will it be enacted?  Will it give adequate powers to the Office of Public Works to deal, once and for all, with the flooding issue?Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach plans, under the Planning and Development Act, to introduce a statutory instrument to remove the exemption from planning for head shops.  The Taoiseach might have a response to that issue.The third issue I raised last week concerns the draft statutory instrument under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  The Taoiseach had indicated that three months' notification had been given to the Commission.  I pointed out to him that, under Commission rules, where there is an issue on the ground of public health an immediate ban can be implemented.  In light of the fact that many aspects of the proposed statutory instrument——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	190	We do not need a Second Stage contribution at this stage.

He was to revert to me on the issue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The advice from the Department of Health and Children was that three months' notice had to be given.  I will ask that a written note be given to the Deputy to update him on the matter.  I apologise that no one has reverted to him since he last raised it.  Second, in regard to the question on the head shop controversy, I understand there is written correspondence between the Minister and the Deputy arising out of an issue he raised on the Order of Business on 25 March.  I cannot add to that.

I met him yesterday evening and he mentioned that he would raise this matter but I have not had an opportunity to check it out.  I will get back to him.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I would like to raise an issue relating to the business of the House.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise a matter on the Adjournment last Thursday, which concerned the withdrawal of 4.5 SNAs from the special school in Celbridge, County Kildare.  The format for the Adjournment debate used to be that a Minister would respond to what a Member had to say but the new format is that a Minister of State is given a sheaf of Civil Service scripts, which the Minister has not seen, to read.  This relates to the business of the House and I would like the Taoiseach to examine this.  For example, the Minister for Education and Science knows much more about the issue I raised than was outlined in the script read by the Minister of State, Deputy Connick.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The Deputy has made his point.

In view of the difficulty in obtaining information and responses in other ways, could it be possible for the Minister or Minister of State who takes Adjournment debates to be briefed and to listen to what Deputies have to say in order that they can respond to the case being made?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	203	The Deputy has made his point.

Even if we cannot agree a package on Dáil reform, the Taoiseach could introduce this change by speaking to Ministers.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I refer to the way we do our business, about which I agree with the previous speaker.  He was kind enough to share time with me for this Adjournment debate last Thursday.  There is no need for Dáil reform in regard to this issue.  This is something that has crept into the system over a number of years.  Every day that passes, I see further evidence of the rights and entitlements of Members being eroded in the manner in which they are treated by the Government.  Members are treated with contempt and it is appalling.  We cannot do the job we were elected to do because we cannot raise a question in the hope of getting a straight answer.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Standing Orders may need to be looked at.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I do not want to be disorderly.  This has nothing to do with Standing Orders.  It has to do with the total disrespect the Government has for the House of Parliament.  I ask that this be dealt with at the Whips' meeting.  There is only one way to deal with this.  If the Government parties do not listen, there are other ways to help and encourage them to listen.  If they want to go that route, that is fine.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I call Deputy O'Sullivan.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I acknowledge what Deputy Stagg said.  I will ask the Chief Whip to ensure this matter is brought to the attention of Ministers and Ministers of State.  Unfortunately, it is often not possible for the relevant Minister to attend because of prior commitments but I will ask that the content be relevant to the question.  It is open at all times to Ministers to listen on Adjournment debates.  There was a case when Deputy Stagg was quite persuasive and sometimes in the past one modified the script when a Deputy contributed.  Perhaps with his growing years, he is becoming less persuasive or less impressive.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I wish to raise two issues.  The first is the promised legislation on health insurance.  The risk equalisation  legislation was struck down by the courts and it has been replaced by a crude levy as a temporary measure.  In the context of difficulties faced by Quinn Insurance and potential difficulties for other health insurance companies, does the Government plan to fast-track the comprehensive legislation planned?  There is a great deal of concern among people who have health insurance that their policies are in difficulty.  What is the timeframe for the legislation?  It should be speeded up because we need proper legislation to underpin the current health insurance system until universal health insurance is introduced by the next Government.With regard to head shops, my colleague, Deputy Costello, and I published legislation on behalf of the Labour Party to make such shops subject to planning law.  It is innocuous legislation, with which every Member would agree.  Will the Taoiseach consider accepting the Bill and bringing it forward as Government legislation, which would mean it would be dealt with more speedily?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I would like to refer to both matters.  With regard to the health insurance issue and risk equalisation, Quinn Insurance has been put into administration because of various matters relating to its reserves being used as collateral.  However, the VHI still fails to meet the standard set for it at 40% of reserves and its fund is way below where it should be.  The EU has complained about this and the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, warned us about this.  When will it be addressed?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	222	A Private Notice Question on this issue will be taken later.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Has the Financial Regulator a view on this?I welcome the initiative taken by my Labour Party colleagues but I asked on a number of occasions in the House that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government issue a directive to bring head shops under planning legislation to dictate where they could open and what their opening hours should be and that the Minister for Health and Children also issue a directive to ensure all substances sold in these shops are approved by the Irish Medicines Board or the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  None of these actions have been taken.  Neither of these issues requires primary legislation.  A ministerial order would achieve what is needed.  Legislation might be required regarding product insurance liability.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I do not blame the Ceann Comhairle because other Members are being disruptive. I attended an interesting press briefing yesterday, which turned into a mini-conference on the mental capacity Bill.  There were four speakers, with one more impressive than the other.  If one has Alzheimer's disease, one can sign over one's property but if one has autism, one cannot sign a contract to buy a house.  This Bill is needed urgently.  The legislation covering people who have the capacity to make decisions for themselves in regard to their health, the law, making a will, their property, where they want to live or who they want to live with was enacted in 1871.  Surely we need the legislation urgently.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I support Deputy Lynch.  This matter is extremely serious.  In a case yesterday a young woman who was allegedly sexually assaulted was not allowed to give evidence in court because she has Down's syndrome and thereby was deemed not to have the intellectual capacity to give evidence in court.  This is extremely serious.  Our law is totally outdated at present and legislation should be brought forward as a matter of urgency.

Something has come to my attention.  I have been looking at the legislative programme in the area of justice.  I cannot find the relevant piece of legislation but perhaps the Taoiseach might give some indication of whether it is intended in the course of proposed legislation to restrict the ability to travel of those who might be suspected of criminal offences or being a member of a criminal gang.  It is not unknown for such people to absent themselves outside the jurisdiction in countries with which we do not have an extradition agreement.  There are plenty of examples of people who could be suspected of criminal offences and might be charged with them and others who are known to be associated with organised crime in general and they seem to be able to——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I attended the meeting of the European Council in Brussels last Thursday and Friday, 25 and 26 March.  The Council's formal agenda indicated that discussion would centre on the new European strategy for growth and jobs, and climate change.  In the event, and as is often the case with European Councils, the build-up was dominated by a topic not formally envisaged on the agenda.  This time, as in February, it was the situation in regard to Greece.  On this occasion, the topic was discussed at two levels — first by the Heads of State and Government of the euro area, and then more broadly by the European Council.  I propose to brief the House on the discussions first.The House will recall that on 11 February at an informal meeting of the European Council, we decided that euro area member states were willing to take determined and co-ordinated action, if needed, to safeguard the financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  A statement to that effect was adopted.  In the days prior to the Spring European Council, there was clearly an expectation that this commitment and preparedness would be fleshed out to some degree.  What is at issue is the question and nature of support for Greece, should the need for such support arise.Members of the House will be aware of the differences of emphasis among some of our partners on matters such as how that support might be organised, the circumstances under which it might be made available, and the role the International Monetary Fund might best play.  There were contacts between governments in the build up to last week's meeting, and on Thursday evening, the Heads of State and Government of the euro area met separately to discuss the situation and try to reach agreement.  I am very pleased that it was possible to reach agreement.  I have already strongly welcomed the outcome on behalf of Ireland.The mechanism agreed is first and foremost about safeguarding financial stability in the euro area.  That is essential for Europe, for euro area member states, and for Ireland.  There are a number of important elements to the agreement.  First, we reasserted the necessity that all member states live up to their responsibilities, domestically and to each other, for the economic and financial stability in the area, and that this requires us all to conduct sound national policies in line with agreed rules.  In this regard, we made clear too our support for the Greek Government's actions, including the additional measures it has announced to ensure it meets the 2010 budgetary targets.We emphasised that what we were agreeing was a contingency arrangement — a last resort measure — to be used only if necessary.  The mechanism, if needed, would involve a combination of IMF finance and eurozone finance, with the eurozone contribution being more than 50%.  Eurozone support to Greece would take the form of bilateral loans.  Any decision to disburse the loans would be taken by the euro area member states unanimously, based on an assessment by the Commission and the ECB.  All euro area member states are expected to participate in this collective effort.  In that context, I signalled this country's willingness to play its proper part in this collective effort to protect our currency, should the need arise.Much of the detailed implementation arrangements remain to be worked out.  One important point to note is that the interest rates to be charged would be "non concessional", that is to say each participating country's costs will be fully covered.  In addition, the euro area Heads of State and Government agreed that we need to strengthen and complement the existing framework for economic co-ordination, and to enhance the area's capacity to act in a time of crisis.  There is now a widely held view that we need to co-ordinate our economic policies more closely so that they are more effective.  This is particularly so in times of crisis.At the same time, a balance must be struck to ensure we do not adversely constrain member states' room for action as we face varying challenges in what are sometimes quite different circumstances.  Bearing that in mind, euro area leaders agreed, in wording that was subsequently adopted by the European Council, to invite the President of the European Council to establish, with the Commission, a task force that would report to the Council on measures to this end before the end of the year.Before concluding on this item, I would like to stress two important points.  First, Greece has not asked for funding.  In this regard, I note the positive developments in recent days in terms of the successful Greek bond issuance.  However, if it should prove necessary to provide support, the mechanism by which it would be provided is now clear.  Second, the agreement balances the solidarity that exists among member states and which lies at the core of the Union, with the requirement that Greece, as with any member state, must meet its obligations and deliver on its commitments.Turning now to the scheduled business of the European Council itself, much of our discussion focused on the issue of competitiveness, both as a topic in its own right and in the context of the proposed new European strategy for jobs and growth, often referred to as Europe 2020, or EU 2020.At our informal meeting in February, the President of the European Commission laid out in very persuasive terms the nature of the challenge facing us in coming decades.  There are mounting challenges from the developing world, demographic challenges within Europe, considerable budgetary challenges arising from the recent exceptional measures, and the challenge of funding pension and social security systems.  We need to begin acting on many of these.  In our case, a number of important measures were flagged at the time of the last budget.My view, which I know is shared by many of my colleagues on the European Council, is that we will have to address a number of these challenges in tandem, either because co-ordination is essential to achieving reform or because it is helpful in the context of partners confronting similar challenges in similar ways, thus avoiding the creation of distortions.We had a good discussion on the proposed strategy, much of which focused on the five headline targets.  These flowed from a proposal by the European Commission in the weeks before the Council meeting.  Appropriately, the first target deals with labour force participation rates.  The aim is to increase our participation rate to 75% of those aged from 20 to 64 years by 2020.  The current rate of participation in Europe is approximately 69%.We agreed to maintain the target of 3% of GDP being invested annually in research and development.  This is consistent with our national target.  The 3% figure is a combined figure for public and private investment and compares to an existing figure of just below 2%.We recommitted ourselves to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% against 1990 levels, increasing the share of renewables in energy consumption to 20% and improving energy efficiency by 20%.  These are essential in terms of environmental sustainability, energy security and broader economic development, having regard to Europe's dependence on external supply of energy.  Setting these 20% targets as part of our economic strategy in no way reflects any change in our readiness to move to a 30% reduction in greenhouse gases if others make commensurate commitments.We agreed to set a target for educational attainment although we have not yet specified a numerical target.  Education is a national competence and in some countries it is also a regional competence.  More discussion is required before all member states can sign up to any target in this regard.The fifth and final headline target relates to the reduction of poverty.  There is a direct link between jobs and growth and the alleviation of poverty.  However, there are diverging views across the Union on how poverty is best measured or benchmarked.  We agreed that further work would need to be done, probably at both expert and sectoral Council levels, before we return to this in June.It remains the intention that the European Council will adopt the new strategy at its next scheduled meeting in June.  Before then, member states will be considering national targets and taking account of national contexts and circumstances.  This will be done in dialogue with the Commission and will, in turn, feed into discussions at sectoral Councils.  These will have a crucial role to play in elaborating and filling in the detail of the strategy.Member states will then draw up national reform programmes setting out how they are to implement their respective strategies.  Our approach will take account of consultation with the social partners, in keeping with the importance of consistency of approach across the economy and society in pursuing shared objectives.As should be clear, Ireland is very supportive of the overall thrust of the strategy, which echoes our own approach domestically, particularly in terms of the smart economy and the emphasis on innovation.  One area that was of particular concern to us in the build-up to last week's meeting was the need to ensure that sufficient recognition would be accorded in the strategy to the important role agriculture and the food industry should play in Europe's future growth and job creation.  In the documentation circulated in advance, agriculture and the food industry were conspicuous by their absence.  In view of this, I, along with a number of other Council members, pressed strongly at the meeting to have this imbalance redressed.  We were not seeking any special status for food and agriculture but simply to have its essential role recognised.  Agriculture is a primary industry in respect of which Europe has real advantages over its competitors in terms of quality and safety standards.  It underpins the food and drinks sector, Ireland's largest manufacturing sector.  We are all aware that global demand for food will grow in the coming years, and it is important that Europe, including Ireland, positions itself to secure a share of that growth and the jobs it will bring.I am pleased to report to the House that my views were accepted, and the conclusions adopted by the Council on Friday reflect well the role a competitive, productive and sustainable agriculture sector can play in Ireland's future economic strategy, in addition to the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy.We also discussed climate change, the aftermath of the Copenhagen conference and the prospects of advancing the international negotiations meaningfully.  Europe is implementing a 20% cut unilaterally, and we remain prepared to make that 30% if others are prepared to make comparable efforts.  Regrettably, there is little evidence that others are in fact prepared to sign up to the more ambitious arrangements that Europe would like to see.  That poses something of a tactical dilemma for Europe in that some of our partners are wondering whether we should drop our level of ambition or continue to press for very ambitious and binding targets.  At last week's meeting, we agreed to press ahead with the provision of fast-start financing within the Copenhagen accord framework, alongside contributions by other key players.This should be seen in the context of our continued determination to press on towards an effective global solution to climate change.  We agreed we needed to strengthen our engagement with others and to make use of all fora, including the G20, to put climate change back on top of the international policy agenda.The Council also took a number of formal or procedural decisions, including appointing Mr. Vitor Constâncio as Vice President of the European Central Bank.All in all, it was a very satisfactory Council meeting from an Irish perspective.  We took the necessary decisions to safeguard the euro area's financial stability and we advanced work towards developing a coherent economic strategy for Europe for the coming decade.  Of particular note from an Irish perspective on that front is that we can expect greater priority will be attached to the agriculture and food industries within our overall economic strategy as a result of the discussions we had last week.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The meeting of the European Council on 25 March and 26 March was dominated by the circumstances in Greece.  Greece has to borrow €53 billion this year and this debt is expected to rise to €290 billion over time.  The Greek Government announced austerity measures and plans for structural reforms on 3 March.  Prime Minister Papandreou believes this shows his country's determination to keep the euro strong and stable.  He also stated high borrowing costs would make it difficult for Greece to meet its budgetary goals.I welcome the statement of solidarity by the European Council on this matter in that, as part of the package involving substantial IMF funding and European financing, which comprises a majority, euro area member states are ready to contribute to the co-ordinated bilateral loans.  We discussed this with the Taoiseach during Question Time.The failure of any eurozone member to meet its obligations would be severely damaging to the single currency.  Any financial support given to Greece, if it arises, must be part of a pathway back to financial stability.  Therefore, any assistance provided must have a clear plan attached that sets out specific steps to ensure recovery.I attended the European People's Party, EPP, summit in Brussels before the European Council meeting.  It was attended by several of the Prime Ministers who attended the latter.  Very strong support was expressed for Greece.  Earlier this month, I accepted responsibility from within the EPP for the area of employment and job protection.  The EPP is the largest political group in the European Union and it is determined to take the lead in tackling the jobs crisis.  The ministerial group I now chair will enable us to do so in a coherent and co-ordinated way.I would like to see job creation and protection placed at the top of the agenda.  For too long the European Union has been talking about institutions and the need to reform them.  It is now time for the politicians to step up to the mark and prove the EU treaty formally adopted and given authority by the Irish electorate works.  If the European Union is to be seen to work by its citizens, there must be support for job protection and creation initiatives.  When one speaks to various Ministers from the European Union, one notes their problems are very different.  Germany does not have enough people to work in health, education or renewables while other countries have different problems.  In three months' time the European Council will formally adopt the main elements of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  Member states will set national targets, taking into account their relative starting positions and individual national circumstances.  Each member state will draw up its own national reform programme and I look forward to the publication of the Irish document by the Government.Vital elements of the plan include job creation, improved education levels and reducing poverty.  Obviously, Ireland has a poor record in aspects of all three.  I look forward to the Government's publication of employment targets and job creation policies for the future.  Just yesterday the Minister for Finance stated that unemployment rates had stabilised, yet the live register figures published by the CSO today reveal that unemployment continues to rise and now stands at 13.4%, the second highest in the eurozone.The most worrying feature of today's figures is the evidence that more and more people are moving from short-term job seeker's benefit to long-term job seeker's allowance, as their credits run out.  Put simply, 88,000 people have moved from the short-term unemployment category into long-term unemployment, which is a severe restriction on them.  The social consequences of long-term unemployment are as serious as the economic consequence currently paralysing the country.  They lead to loss of hope, destroy communities, cause poverty and serious personal problems for so many.On the issue of poverty, the 2020 strategy includes a commitment to promote social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty.  In the last year, however, the Government abolished the Combat Poverty Agency and 100,000 people now live in consistent poverty.  A major commitment in the national action plan on social inclusion aims to reduce the numbers of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012.  However, the EU survey on income and living conditions, released in December 2008, which applied to 2007, indicated that the rate of consistent poverty within the population that year was 5.1%.The 2020 strategy commits to improving educational levels in particular, by aiming to improve school drop-out levels, and by increasing the share of the population that will complete third level or its equivalent.  Taking into account the Commission's proposals, the European Council will set the numerical rates for these targets in June 2010.Ireland's drop-out rates are very high.  In 2007 the ESRI said that 14% of students do not complete the leaving certificate while the TUI suggests that as many as one in five drop out before the leaving certificate, which increases to one in three in some parts of Dublin.  This is not good enough.I welcome the inclusion, at the Taoiseach's request, of agriculture and the future of CAP reform in the Council's conclusions.  This is something we should discuss here in a serious manner and it will provide a great opportunity, if exploited properly.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I want to take up a few points raised by Deputy Kenny, in particular his final point as regards the agriculture and food industry.  This is where we have a competitive advantage.  We can provide a unique product and during the Celtic tiger years agriculture was often seen to be backstage.  However, it is something we need to work on.  Ireland has a unique environment for the production of food and drink.  Perhaps we need to re-examine how we can market the industry to a greater extent.  I always quote the fact that we have just one member of Bord Bia in the United States promoting Irish food and drink.Allied to that is the commitment at the Council for 3% of GDP to be spent on research and development.  Again, because we have few natural resources in Ireland, this is an area that might give us a competitive advantage.  We should seek to increase the percentage of GDP that is spent on research and development.During times of great difficulty one of the most important qualities is pragmatism.  I realise that the former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was berated for promoting the concept of Irish people going abroad armed with a degree or whatever, but Deputy Kenny has mentioned the fact that in Germany there are job opportunities in health, education and the renewables.  We have always extolled the virtues of Europe, free movement and how Ireland is European.  I believe that in times of difficulty when people are unemployed here, and there are job opportunities in Germany or elsewhere, we have got to put a mechanism or an information centre in place to assist Irish people to get jobs abroad.  They are better off being employed in Germany, teaching, than on the dole queues here in Ireland.  Hopefully, when the economy turns, as it will although perhaps not as quickly as we would like, these people will have an opportunity to return home.Allied to that is the difficulty of freedom of movement.  This has been emphasised by the difficulties we have seen in the passport office.  This is pertinent to the three Ministers in the Chamber at present, namely, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We have to look at the whole are of freedom of movement and signing up to the Schengen Agreement.These Ministers must work out a formula with their British counterparts as regards how we can have freedom of movement across Europe.  It should be one of the great advantages of EU membership, yet we cannot avail of this facility.  If we had this facility many people would not have been held to ransom in the manner they were in recent days.  We have virtually the same currency, there are no border controls and yet when we go into Europe in the first instance we must provide a passport.  The time has come, several years after free movement was introduced in Europe, for Ireland to integrate itself into this.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, must work with his British colleague, the Foreign Secretary, Mr. David Miliband, MP, to try to bring about the political will to remove this barrier to free movement across Europe.  It is essential and I cannot overemphasise the importance of having a pragmatic and progressive approach towards Irish people getting jobs in Europe.  We were happy to have people here from abroad during the years of the Celtic tiger to help build the economy.  Equally, we should be prepared, when there is a downturn, to assist Irish people in setting up elsewhere.It is very important that the main item on the Council's agenda was safeguarding financial stability within the eurozone.  Ireland's irresponsible economic policies did not greatly assist such stability over the last ten years.  One might say, there but for the grace of Greece go us.  We may use Greece as a fall guy, but in its own way Ireland is equally to blame.The Taoiseach mentioned a task force.  Notwithstanding the fact that Greece has not looked for financial assistance but if nonetheless assistance has to be given to a eurozone country in the future, what mechanism will be used to do this from the viewpoint of the member states and the IMF?  This is the type of issue that should be discussed here in this House before it is agreed at the General Council meeting.This equally applies to education.  The Taoiseach said it was a question of national competence.  Yesterday I met a young fellow from Germany, Nicholas, who said that everyone from his school could speak perfect English.  We have to look at developing languages in our schools, including German, French and Spanish.  Again, the issue of education competence and agreement on the attainment of a certain level across Europe should be teased out either here in the House or before the Joint Committee on Education and Science to determine what we should be looking for.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I welcome the fact that the Heads of Government in the eurozone countries are meeting formally after European Council meetings.  This has been necessitated by the economic crisis but hopefully it will become a permanent arrangement, as is envisaged by the Lisbon treaty.I am aware the Council has initiated excessive deficit procedures against virtually every member state.  In 2009 the only two member states to keep their deficits below 3% were Luxembourg and, I believe, Denmark.   The sad reality for Ireland is that most of the EU member states will, over the next 12 months, start to position themselves to begin balancing their budgets, and we will not be in a position to do that.As regards the 2020 strategy, it is right and correct that there is an emphasis on the smart economy, on innovation and the futuristic economic priorities.  However, it is important, too, to acknowledge that from a domestic viewpoint — this is replicated in many other member states — a great many of the unemployed have lost jobs in manufacturing.  This is due to companies relocating to more competitive environments in Eurasia and elsewhere and to the collapse of the construction industry in Ireland, the UK and in other member states.  I am not convinced the 2020 strategy addresses that.  There is an immediate employment crisis within the eurozone and the European Union but much of the 2020 strategy is long term and does not address the short-term economic needs of member states.  I hope the Taoiseach will take that on board.  I welcome the focus he has given to the agri-food sector, which is a step forward, but given that the strategy is to be finalised in June, I hope the immediate needs of low skilled workers will be taken into account and built into the strategy.I welcome the proposals for the draft regulation on the European citizens' initiative which were published today.  That is an important step.  It is important that the European Union is seen to deliver on commitments made to the people, particularly in Ireland given that we held a referendum.  Those commitments must be tangible and delivered.  The target date for implementation of the regulation is 1 December and I hope the Government will pursue that actively and ensure it moves forward in a speedy fashion.The European external action service appears to be a bone of contention.  There appears to be a failure to agree on certain high level appointments and the structural procedures that must be put in place.  Perhaps the Taoiseach or the Minister would address that in the course of this debate.  There was a decision of the European Council six years ago that the appointment of the European ambassador to the United States would be a political appointment.  Obviously, that appointment was important from our point of view because an Irish man was ultimately appointed.  However, it is unacceptable that the Commission proceeded to appoint a successor who is not a political appointment.  It is in complete contravention of a political decision taken at the European Council six years ago.  Carl Bildt, along with other Foreign Ministers, raised this on a formal basis in the past couple of months and I hope the Irish Government will add its voice to that criticism.  It is unacceptable.  There is much cynicism and scepticism about how the European Commission operates and this action should not be allowed to pass without comment by the Government.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The Council meeting last week was essentially about saving Greece and protecting the euro.  While that was not on the agenda, it dominated the meeting.  For that reason it was probably a more important summit than we might think.  Important principles were involved in the decisions taken, which I believe were the right decisions.  Certainly the spectre hanging over the talks from the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, with regard to abandoning the euro or requiring some member states of the euro to leave and the International Monetary Fund to be the means of dealing with the financial problem, was not acceptable in terms of solidarity.  I was delighted the end result was that all 16 member states of the euro stuck with their member state colleagues and an arrangement was hammered out that will maintain both that collegiality and the integrity of the euro.  It was the right decision.  Perhaps it should not have come to that but the result was right and fitting.I raised this matter with the Taoiseach in the Dáil last week.  Once this country is engaged in a matter of making financial commitments either at home or abroad, it should be discussed in the House in plenary session.  The Taoiseach did make a financial commitment of €248 million in terms of underpinning a loan, if that was required, for the Greek bailout.  That is something that is appropriate and pertinent to discussion in the House.  When we know there are serious issues on which decisions must be made when the Taoiseach goes to Brussels, they should come up for debate in this House beforehand in order that the Opposition has an opportunity to express its view and that we are made aware whether a financial contribution might be elicited with regard to those forthcoming decisions.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will take that on board.We are happy with the manner in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs appears before the Joint Committee on European Affairs prior to a Council meeting.  When he attends the following meeting he reports on what transpired.  That is welcome but the real decisions are made by the Taoiseach and where there are substantial matters involving finance, we should be able to examine them.  Perhaps something could be done——

We will expect to see him in the Dáil more often to discuss Council meetings.There was something a little surreal about the Taoiseach pledging funds to Greece, a case of the Irish bearing gifts to the Greeks, on the one hand and, on the other, discovering the following week the hole that existed in our own financial system.  The Celtic tiger had certainly turned into a tragedy; one might call it a Greek tragedy.  Anyway, that was an important issue and I hope the first step we have taken is a step in the right direction, although we are not yet out of the woods in this respect.The 2020 new European strategy for jobs and growth was the other major issue discussed.  I have already expressed my disappointment that it is quite a modest strategy.  The targets are modest.  It is really just an extension of the 2000 strategy, the Lisbon agenda, which was not successfully implemented.  I cannot see much new thinking or new strategies to improve on the ten years up to now, during which the European Union was to become the most competitive, dynamic entity in the world.  There is no sign of that.  If anything, it is struggling.  The 3% for research and development was also in place ten years ago.  We have not reached it ourselves yet; we are only at 2% and have a long way to go, although we started more slowly.  The 2020 targets relating to energy and climate change are what we have already expressed.  There is talk about innovation and employment but there are no strategies in that regard at present.I note that each country has been asked to produce a national reform programme.  Who will front the national reform programme Ireland is preparing?  What Minister will be in charge?  What will be the focus of that programme?  Will it be jobs and employment?  If it is employment, will that be for the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation or the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív, at the new Department of Social Protection?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	281	For what programme?
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	282	Who will be the lead Minister in regard to the national reform programme the European Council has now tasked each member state to adopt?  The framework that was discussed at the last Council meeting will be adopted in June, as I understand it.  Once that is done, each country must produce its own national reform programme.  What will Ireland do in this regard?  Will we put the new Minister with responsibility for innovation and enterprise in charge and will his be the lead ministry?What ministry is in charge of employment?  Will employment be the lead area in the 2020 strategy?  These are the important issues we need to discuss.  It is an area that should be part and parcel of a broader discussion rather than simply being left to a Minister, with something being drawn up by the Civil Service and the Department.  We need a broad discussion in the House on this matter, and I would certainly like to see that happen.With regard to climate change, unfortunately, we made little or no progress at Copenhagen.  As the Taoiseach said, it was a great disappointment.  There seems to be very little sign of progress at present.  Who is the lead person in the EU in this regard?  Is it the President of the European Council, who will convene a meeting in September to consider the global issues of climate, or is it the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy?  Where is the dividing line?  Will they both be involved?  Much international negotiation is required if we are to get a global deal.  We made a commitment under the Lisbon treaty that climate change would be an area in which the EU would be the world leader.  I want to know where we stand in Europe.  Who will actually lead in Europe on climate change and what will the direction be?The European external action service proposals that were made by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy have all, as I  understand it, been shot down by the Parliament.  What was the position of the Council and was this discussed at the Council meeting and at the Commission?  Are the Commission and Council ad idem with the Parliament on this matter?  There seem to be many perceived flaws in the proposals that were put forward on the external action service.  What is Ireland’s position on these matters?
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The Taoiseach in his contribution stated: "At the same time, of course, there is a balance to be struck to ensure that we do not adversely constrain member states' room for action as we face varying challenges in sometimes quite different circumstances."  I agree with this comment in response to the position in which Greece found itself.  It is very interesting to note how the newspaper comment on the position in Greece ignored the transition in government that took place and, with it, the transition in economic policies in regard to Greece.  Prime Minister Papandreou is being advised by Joseph Stiglitz in a particular form of reconstruction of the Greek economy.Does the Taoiseach agree it is time to introduce to the Council a consideration of transaction taxes at global level?  This is in fact the restatement of the case for the Tobin tax.  There is no doubt that what was deeply disappointing in the run-in to the Council on which the Taoiseach is reporting was the nearly irresponsible attitude of the German Chancellor, who ignored the significance of the speculative cloud hanging over the Greek currency.  In addition, let me place on record the inglorious and disgraceful activity by international institutional forces, such as Goldman Sachs, in facilitating this threat to the Greek currency.  These matters are not abstract ones invented by me; they are real.  I would welcome the Government taking a strong position of advocacy in regard to a transaction tax.With regard to the balance between monetary and fiscal policy, it is a matter of first order that, while we have economic and monetary union, we have a set of mechanisms to achieve stability.  At the same time, we must bear in mind a breakaway is taking place from all forms of economy internationally, and this is being reflected in different ways in individual economies.  This is not just a matter for the G8 and G20, whose thinking sometimes interferes with solidarity thinking within the EU itself.  In that sense, there is rightly a huge difference between fiscal policy and monetary policy.  While the German Chancellor may favour a treaty amendment that would extend monetary policy to encroach on what is fiscal policy and, therefore, a national responsibility, this would be very dangerous.  The reality, of course, is that she may well be swept away and we will be dealing with an entirely new paradigm that will prevail in Europe.For the first time in the history of the State, we have a Minister with the title of "social protection".  It was one of our not so glorious achievements that during the time of speculative levels of growth sustained by among other things, the property bubble, we had low levels of social protection.  We can leave the argument about how that is measured for another day.  Nonetheless, however it is measured, the level of social protection was low.  Therefore, in regard to the other agendas to which the Taoiseach referred, an issue arises as to how we will achieve social inclusion at a time when 80 million people are unemployed in the European Union.One of the most important points is to return to the debate about European citizenship, in that European citizenship must not be confined by the experience of unemployment.  Member states differ in this regard.  If one is unemployed, one should be able to participate fully as a citizen in regard to the public space, public institutions and so on.  It also provides the best opportunity of not moving from being a cyclically unemployed person to being a long-term unemployed person.With regard to the matters raised by Deputy Costello in regard to climate change, while of course Copenhagen was a disappointment, as we prepare for the conference in Mexico, it is important that Ireland takes a lead in building alliances with, for example, the bloc of developing countries in regard to their capacity and the transfer of resources and technology.  We must also ensure that the preparations for a European Union position in Mexico will not be confined to the rather dubious relationships of the strong but will include a genuine set of relationships and alliances.  In other words, Ireland can be responsible as a member of the common European Union position but it is also uniquely placed to have a very positive constructive position on matters that will affect those most vulnerable to climate change through its development model.

To be frank, the existing position has prevailed for some time and it may be opportune to have a review.  I will discuss having a review of the situation with my colleagues in Government, without any commitment either way.  Ireland is not a party to Schengen.  As it develops with regard to visa arrangements with other countries, particularly with those in the western Balkans, I would be open to writing a review of the options and I will revert to the Deputy.

Will the Minister give the House an indication of both Ireland's and the European Union's position on this issue?  I asked a question about climate change.  Has Ireland determined the line of authority between the new President of the European Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy?  There seems to be quite an amount of disagreement as to where the line is drawn in terms of functions.I put my third question to the Taoiseach but the Minister indicated he wished to reply.  I asked if there could be a discussion in the House prior to the summit on matters flagged by the Minister as being on the summit agenda which may be of considerable national consequence.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The European Council did not consider the matter of the European External Action Service, EEAS.  Substantial work has been carried out in recent weeks on the EEAS.  In my view, it is potentially one of the most important innovations of the Lisbon treaty and supports the work of the new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Catherine Ashton.  We had discussions at the informal meeting at Córdoba and at the foreign affairs meeting last Monday week.  On 25 March, the High Representative presented her proposals for a Council decision on the organisation and functioning of the EEAS, together with related proposals on budgetary and staff matters.  Those proposals followed intensive consultations with the stakeholders, including the member states.  The Council will make its decision after consulting the European Parliament and obtaining the consent of the European Commission.  The Parliament will have the power of co-decision in regard to the associated budgetary and staffing legislation.The proposals are complex and will require careful scrutiny and debate in the coming weeks.  I look forward to discussing them with my colleagues at the Council meeting on 26 April.  This will be a very important decision for the Council with very long-term consequences.  I have made the point many times to other Foreign Ministers and colleagues that we are all birds of passage.  Whatever one's personal views, we have to create an edifice that endures and will represent a constructive added value to the European institutional framework.  That is our positive approach.The decision will deal with links between the EEAS and other EU institutions, particularly the Commission, of which the high representative is also vice president, and the European Parliament, which will be consulted regularly by the high representative on the main aspects and basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The guidelines for the EEAS, endorsed by the European Council, remain a valid basis for considering the high representative's proposals.  These proposals include provision for the staff recruitment process and consequential amendments to the European Union staff regulations.  The proposals provide it will comprise officials from relevant departments of the Commission and the Council secretariat, as well as staff seconded from national diplomatic services of member states.  Irish candidates will be permitted to compete for positions within the EEAS on an equal footing with those from other member states.  We have sought a general expression of interest in working for the EEAS from Irish diplomats.  We have been pressing for an open and transparent approach.  I can take other questions if the Deputy wishes.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The Council ultimately decides for Europe with regard to the international relationship.  The President of the Council and the President of the Commission are working together on our case with the strategic partners to achieve progress.  The high representative is also a member of the Commission as vice president and will be involved in these consultations.  The Commissioner for Climate Action made a presentation to the Foreign Affairs Council meeting some weeks' ago.  Discussions were held on the format from Cancun and whether the format agreed in Copenhagen is the best way of endeavouring to achieve international agreement on these issues.  After Copenhagen, the Taoiseach was of the view that the modality was not the optimum, to say the least.  In our discussions with President Obama there seems to be a general consensus that it would be very difficult to achieve agreement at a large plenary meeting and to deal with the nuts and bolts of negotiations.  Cancun will be a platform to advance what was agreed in Copenhagen.People are looking to the year 2011 for the prospect of an agreement.  However, in our view, a smaller group of leaders might be preferable.  From the perspective of the European Union, we need the President of the Council, along with President Barroso and the Commission, to represent Europe at these talks.  It is preferable to have just enough numbers in the other blocs — not the G20 — but enough numbers to sit around a table to hammer out an agreement.  This will not work with 150 to 200 people in a big plenary assembly.Deputy Costello's third question was about discussion prior to the summit meeting.  I am all in favour of such discussions.  This is what happens at the Joint Committee on European Affairs and we do it well there.  We are great for saying we should have discussions but I remind Members what happened this morning on the Order of Business.  I do not wish to be disparaging in my remarks but the Order of Business is an awful waste of time for about ten, 15 or 20 minutes.  Members ask the same old questions and they we give out about Parliament not giving enough time to discussions on Europe.  We need to be serious about our business.Certainly, legitimate issues are raised on the Order of Business but it drags on.  Today, we began the European Council agenda at 12.15 p.m.  This is a substantive debate about our relationship with Europe.  Half the issues raised on the Order of Business are questions yet again on whether the firearms Bill is being published, for instance.  We could tighten up the timeframe.  We keep on calling for the opportunity to debate but it seems at times a lot of trivia gets in the way of substantial debate.  Members may wish to join the Joint Committee on European Affairs in advance of its discussion on the General Affairs Council.  It is emerging that the General Affairs Council will be the preparatory forum for the European Council.  I am attending that Council and will give it the serious attention it deserves.  Not all foreign ministers attend because of the differing structures of their offices but we have been asked and, to be fair, Mr. Van Rompuy is attending the dinners with the General Affairs Council with a view to having an impact on the agenda for the Council.  I will consult the Taoiseach on the matter but our current preference is to utilise the Joint Committee on European Affairs in a real way.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I ask the Minister whether he has had an opportunity to reflect on the renewed debate on an international transaction tax, also known as the Tobin tax.  This issue arose during the preparations for the Council and in the discussion on the response to the Greek issue.The construction of the phrase "as a final resort" in the communique on the Greek issue is somewhat ambiguous to my mind.  It is linked to my first question because the character of the statement emerging from the Council would have a direct effect on the speculative threat posed to the Greek economy and, therefore, the phrase was interpreted as a statement of solidarity from the European Union with German reservations.  I will leave aside the role of the International Monetary Fund because our time is limited but the Minister may wish to clarify the issue.  The Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Papandreou, wanted a strong formula which would drive off what he regarded as a highly organised speculative threat but discussion then moved towards the possible involvement of the IMF.  To put the question as bluntly as a Greek politician would, does the phrase mean that we will not be let fall altogether once the speculative flows have had their whack at the Greek economy or is it a textual use intended to drive off this speculative threat?I have already asked about such alliances as we may make to prepare for Mexico.  In other words, I hope our development experience will not be quenched through the common position.  While we should sign up to the common position, we also have the benefit of other alliances in the context of a United Nations led role in establishing a legally binding text.Will recruitment to the external action service be confined to the diplomatic corps and will it be a house of mandarins?  I have great respect for diplomacy and its long list of achievements since the time of Talleyrand but this agency will be responsible for foreign policy rather than diplomacy, which is the application of the foreign policies decided by elected parliaments, and its recruitment process should be both wide and public.

To be fair, however, they prefer consistency in some respects.  Prior to becoming President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy expressed to us his view as Belgian Prime Minister of the proposal.  The fact that the proposal is likely to arise for discussion means that we have to give it our considered examination before taking a stance on it.In terms of the Council's communique on Greece, we should note that country's success in its recent bond issue, even if the price was quite high.  The Council wanted to show its solidarity but, as Deputies will be aware, the difficulties in this respect were well flagged.  The Germans in particular had grave concerns about rushing in with a support mechanism.  What has been achieved is not only a statement of solidarity, but also a commitment that a loan facility will be available if required.  However, the Greek Government has not yet requested any assistance.  It is a significant statement in itself that Europe will come to the rescue.

Other factors motivated the response in terms of public opinion and electoral issues within Germany.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	320	To be fair to Germany, it has been a strong supporter of the European Union and it has to lay down markers on the protection or rescue packages it is prepared to put together.  There is merit to both sides of the argument and the solution that has been devised is the best that can be achieved in the context of 27 members states with differing perspectives.  We supported that solution.On the climate change issue, we maintain our development perspective that any agreement reached should be strongly weighted in favour of supporting developing countries.  We believe the mechanics of the UN negotiated framework need to be investigated.  Most participants felt that Copenhagen involved too much plenary articulation and less hard negotiation.  Europe has led on this and there is a growing sense of irritation among member states, which I would share to an extent, that the EU has pushed and pushed.  I recently met the director general of the WTO, Pascal Lamy, in Geneva.  From my observation of trade talks, Europe tends to put its best foot forward and its proposals are pocketed.  One wonders are others coming to the table with serious proposals that could result in an international agreement.  This applies to trade as much as it does to climate change.  Unfortunately, the world cannot wait for climate change in terms of its impact, especially in Africa and other developing nations.  Recently in Haiti we saw a natural disaster.  That was not related to climate change but nonetheless it took place in a country not effectively developed and if one does not have defences in place and so on, the impact can be horrendous.  This is also the case with climate change.  The impact is altogether shocking where there is very poor infrastructure and defences.  We cannot afford to wait too long.I refer to another point worth remembering about Copenhagen.  Progress was made there and we should not dismiss it too much.  In Mexico, the key step will be to consolidate that and move it forward significantly such that the prospects for an agreement in 2011 are real and possible.

I welcome the fact that he is committed to considering the travel arrangement.  That is a welcome development and although I do not know how it will work out in the end, it is important.  I urge the Minister to consider the issue I raised earlier about the job opportunities in Germany and to which Deputy Kenny referred.  I realise there is a concern that the Minister might appear to be exporting our unemployed or those who cannot obtain employment at the moment, but it would be useful to examine the concept of setting up a channel or mechanism to assist Irish people to get jobs in Europe or to explore where there may be opportunities for them.  This would represent a very pragmatic approach and one from which we should not shy away.The Taoiseach referred to Europe and the real advantage Ireland has over our competitors in terms of quality and safety standards in food and drink production.  It is very important to return to this area.  Is the Minister of the view that his European colleagues are satisfied with regard to the safety and quality of Irish food?  I refer to the traditional issue of BSE disease and the pork scare.  For example, my understanding is that our market share of beef in Germany was reduced dramatically at the time of the BSE scare and has never recovered.  Will the Minister discuss the matter with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with a view to renewing our efforts to get back a certain market share of beef in Germany.The Taoiseach referred to the direct link between jobs, growth and the alleviation of poverty.  I refer to a submission by Fr. Seán Healy of Social Justice Ireland at the Joint Committee on European Affairs meeting last week.  The 2020 document had no overt reference to social exclusion.  Will the Minister re-examine the submission made by Social Justice Ireland to try to secure commitments to the alleviation of poverty in that document?  I realise the Taoiseach made reference to it and perhaps it has been somewhat amended at this stage.  Fr. Healy made a worthwhile contribution at the committee.The area of education to which I alluded briefly is a national competence.  I gather the term used in the speech is the "target for educational attainment".  As a former Minister for Education and Science, the Minister will probably have strong views on this matter and I wish to hear them.  I realise every time a politician is here, he or she will say such and such should be on the curriculum.  By the same token, I maintain the curriculum is too expansive at this stage to the extent that the basics of literacy and numeracy skills have suffered because there is not sufficient time to place an emphasis on them.  These are the most important aspects of early education and they are formed at the most suitable period for the development of language skills for children.  This should be examined but at exclusion of what I do not know.  However, perhaps with the new agreement between the public sector unions and the Government for longer working hours, this could be fitted in.  Does the Minister have a view on this matter?During Question Time yesterday I raised the matter of the use of Irish passports in Dubai.  I do not wish to return to this because it is like the draining of the Shannon, but did it come up at the Council meeting?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	325	In respect of the last question, the answer is "No".  In terms of jobs opportunities Irish people work a great deal throughout Europe.  There are many Irish people working in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and all European countries.  On this day last week, I was in Paris for a long day at a session involving Irish engineering companies.  I refer to one particular company involved in project management which is doing a project with Sanofi Aventis.  It is the main design team and there are 50 people employed in Ireland on that project, based in Cork and a further 20 employees on site.  Enterprise Ireland works with Irish companies to penetrate markets.  It is clear to me that we must pay more attention to Europe which has very strong markets for us.  France is the largest market for Irish seafood.  Beef has recovered significantly and Europe is now our main market.  It is a premium product and commands a high price.  Many of the markets we have since broken into and to which we have made representations are not really in a position to buy Irish beef given the price at the moment.Bord Bia has been working very hard in the European market.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food led a significant trade mission in Italy during St. Patrick's week.  This was directed and organised by the board.  There is a very strong focus on the European market because it is a good market.  I do not have a specific figure for the German market but I can get the details for the Deputy and send them on.  This is the reason we were keen at the European Council to ensure there was a strong reference in the conclusions to agriculture and in particular to food because innovation applies to food as it does to any other sector of the economy in terms of the sustainability of an innovative food industry for the future.  We succeeded in securing the reference along with the French and other interested parties.  Although I do not wish to overlap with another bureaucracy, as part of a post-Farmleigh initiative I am working on the idea of an overseas graduate programme.

FÁS has a link with its European equivalents in terms of job opportunities in other markets in the same way as when we were booming many of those agencies accessed our websites to establish what job opportunities were in Ireland in the various sectors.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I agree 100% with the Deputy.  The modern world is different.  Some 50 or 60 years ago, emigration was a one way ticket but today it is a two-way ticket.  Some 10% of the start-up companies from Enterprise Ireland involve people who have returned from abroad.  Travel makes it a smaller world.  We are an international global people and we must continue to be.  We cannot make enough money in this market.  Our companies must go overseas and establish a presence there to penetrate those markets and we must provide solutions to the global world, global business and global industry.  This is in such areas as software, the life sciences, project management skills and so on.  Many companies under the Enterprise Ireland umbrella are everywhere.  We also need an influence overseas.  The global Irish network is interesting because one begins to see where Irish people are located and the positions in which they find themselves, the influence they can wield and the advice and guidance they can provide to this and subsequent Governments.  I recall the FÁS overseas graduate programme during the 1980s.  It is remarkable to see how many of those people progressed in life and how they have helped the country as well as developing their own careers.I refer to the question on numeracy and literacy education.  We are very strong in the area of literacy at primary level.  We place third in the OECD analysis of attainment in literacy.  We do not place as high in numeracy or maths which is where we must focus more of our efforts, especially at second level in terms of how we structure our approach to maths in particular.  However, there are a number of issues in Europe.  The German education system is a regional one and the regions are baulking at the idea of a European objective, even though in this Council conclusion it would be a general sort of attainment objective as opposed to any governance issues or anything like that.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I am aware from my initial contacts with tourism industry interests of potential difficulties in the availability and pricing of car hire during the peak summer period.I understand that a number of events have brought about the contraction in the car hire fleet.  Traditionally, car rental companies bought new cars from dealers.  They required the dealer to agree a price at which he or she would buy the car back at a later date.  This facilitated dealers and car rental companies to secure credit to make their purchases.  Falling prices in the second-hand car market and overcrowded forecourts in 2008 meant that dealers made significant losses on the arrangement.  I understand that, following that experience, dealers are no longer prepared to enter such agreements and, therefore, are supplying fewer cars to the rental industry.  I have been advised that the problem is compounded by the levels of credit available in the economy and the trend by domestic motorists towards smaller, more carbon-efficient cars and away from the larger, automatic transmission cars more popular with many overseas visitors.My officials and representatives of the tourism agencies have been in ongoing discussions with the tourism industry to help identify solutions that will ameliorate  potential difficulties in 2010.  I am open to considering any proposals that the industry may now wish to put forward in the light of the outcome of the debate on tax-based solutions during the passage through the House of the Finance Bill.  It may well be that the existing car hire business model which is dependent on a high turnover of new car sales is no longer appropriate in the current market and will have to adapt to changed circumstances.Accordingly, I would hope that the wider market would respond to the commercial opportunities arising.  I would also be concerned that the car hire sector would exercise restraint in any scope for car hire rate increases arising from potential shortages, on the basis of the medium to longer-term damage that this would have on Irish tourism and, indeed, their own businesses.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I wish the Minister well on her first questions here in her new Ministry.I realise that she is at least partly familiar with this problem, which has arisen, I suppose, as a result of a treble whammy — the scrappage scheme, the general recession and the lack of credit in the economy.  She stated she would like the industry to refrain from putting up prices.  The reality is most of them will be put out of business.  At this stage it is a question not of putting up prices, but of trying to stay in business.The impact of this is catastrophic in that there will be a maximum of between 10,000 and 12,500 cars available when at least 20,000 are required.  Already cancellations of holidays are resulting, particularly from the American market.  Obviously, Americans come for longer than a weekend in most cases and approximately 45% of them hire a car.  Of those, the vast majority need automatic transmission cars, the shortage of which is even greater.  If we are to lose that kind of business, it will have a significant impact throughout the country.The other area that will really suffer is the bed and breakfast accommodation business, which is already suffering badly and 80% of whose customers hire a car.  It will have a considerable impact right around the country, not so much in the cities but further afield.According to conservative estimates of the impact of this, 1,500 jobs will be lost to the industry, €28 million will be lost in Government revenue and more than €120 million will be lost in revenue to the industry.The Minister stated that the industry should not overcharge, and that is good advice assuming they can stay in business.  However, the Minister for Finance suggested that rather than change the general taxation system or grant exceptions in the general area of taxation, a solution could be found in a direct subsidy from Deputy Hanafin's Department.  I do not know whether he has communicated this to the Minister, but I wonder if she has any plans in this regard.  If she has such plans, now is the time to announce them given that the season started effectively on St. Patrick's Day and Easter is approaching.  If the Minister has plans to give a subsidy that would encourage the motor industry to provide cars at a reasonable price to the car rental industry, now is the time to announce them.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I thank Deputy Mitchell for her good wishes.  We share the same interest in this area of tourism, culture and sport, and I look forward to working with this Department.There are a number of issues in this regard.  I accept that there is a potential problem here for the tourist industry generally.  However, the model that the car hire industry has been using has always insisted on new cars.  The car hire industry will raise arguments about warranties, guarantees, etc., but perhaps it should be looking to include good-quality second-hand cars as well because there are thousands of them on the forecourts of the garages, and there may be potential in that area.  There may also be potential for the car hire industry to use cars with lower CO2 emissions because these are obviously cheaper in VRT terms, and perhaps it could benefit from that.In looking at the costs comparable to other capital cities, so far this month Dublin would seem to be comparable with major cities.  Certainly, coming into the summer the prices on offer are comparable, but already we are seeing that August will be more expensive in Ireland than elsewhere.  That is not acceptable because that will even damage the tourist industry that we have, notwithstanding that other people might be impacted about there not being a sufficient number of cars.A subsidy scheme was introduced a number of years ago and it was a direct handout to the car industry.  If we were to do that now, it would be money that would come from the tourism budget.  It would come directly from other projects because no extra funding is available.  It would be questionable as to whether it would conflict with EU state-aid rules because one would be subsidising directly, not merely to a particular industry but to a very limited one because four companies control 80% of the market.There are issues surrounding it.  I expect the tourism industry to make proposals to me as to what it sees might be the solution, and I would be happy to engage with it on its ideas.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I realise there is no easy solution and no matter what the Minister does, it will cost money.  It seems to me this is not the year to have the treble whammy, certainly not to withdraw an advantage that the industry had for the same reason, lack of supply, since the early 1990s.I accept what the Minister stated about automatic transmission and lower emission cars.  The trouble is that the Americans, by and large, can only drive automatic transmission cars which produce high emissions and the reality is that is the market we are going after.  We are spending hundreds of thousands of euro on marketing in the American market, and it is throwing good money after bad if they then cannot drive when they get here because most of them will not come if they cannot drive.The Minister is incorrect in stating cars will only get dearer in August; they are dearer now.  If one compares car hire in Ireland and in Scotland, for instance, which is a comparable market and which is going after much the same kind of visitor, in Scotland they are up to 100% cheaper in some cases.  It is not true to state that the shortage is not already hitting.The Minister stated she will speak to the industry.  What the industry will tell her is that if there is one action she could take, it is to reinstate the vehicle registration tax subsidy which has been withdrawn in the worst possible year to do so.On the Minister's point about using second-hand cars, the reality is that we must maintain standards here.  She knows if she went abroad she would get a new car.  If one goes to any other country in Europe, one gets a new car rather than a second-hand car.  If one starts going down that road of hiring second-hand cars, we can forget the tourism industry.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	336	A good quality second-hand relatively new car — I do not refer to one that is five or ten years old — would be better than no car at all if it is offered at a good rate.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	338	When I spoke of the survey of the costs, it was comparing capital cities.  Differences will be found in price when one compares the west with parts of Scotland.  Regarding the subsidies introduced several years ago, in 1992 the average payment was approximately €900 but gave only 1,260 cars extra.  Even the whole value of the subsidy scheme is questionable.  I am looking forward to receiving the report from the tourism industry and will be happy to engage with it on solutions it believes are applicable.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	339	The report of the tourism renewal group, published in October 2009, set out the tourism sector's contribution to Ireland's economic and social development and its prospects in a changed world economy.  It made recommendations in the form of a framework for action for tourism survival, recovery and growth from 2009 to 2013.  This framework contains five survival actions to minimise the impact of current challenges and nine recovery actions to set tourism back on a growth path as the world economy recovers.The renewal group also proposed that, given the progress made on implementing the actions set out in the tourism development strategy, New Horizons, a broadly similar approach should be adopted to the implementation of its recommendations including the establishment of a renewal implementation group.In advance of formal mechanisms or specific implementation arrangements, departmental officials have been working hard to progress the recommended actions and measures.  The focus initially has been on the survival actions which are being pursued with the tourism agencies and other relevant Departments and bodies.My Department's priority has been on achieving progress on the framework rather than on formal mechanisms or processes.  For example, building on the renewal group's framework for action, along with the Government's wider strategy for economic renewal, the 2010 budget recognised the tourism sector as a critical and labour-intensive sector for which it provided an increase in the overall tourism services budget.  This included maintaining levels of investment in overseas marketing, as well as sustaining investment in tourism product through a significantly increased capital allocation.  Budget 2010 also introduced further measures, both cross-cutting and tourism-specific, to support the sector and to help it recover.Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have built in the relevant renewal group recommendations to their business and marketing plans for 2010.  Departmental officials are also working with a range of other organisations to develop opportunities to focus resources, to achieve common objectives and to maximise the impact on tourism.Notwithstanding that a formal renewal implementation group has not been established to date, good progress has been made on implementing the group's recommendations.  Drawing on its report, and complemented by general supports for enterprise, the Department is identifying the right measures and working with other Departments and the tourism agencies to drive their delivery.  The objective is to position the tourism sector for recovery and growth as the Irish and global economies get back on track.  I am considering what mechanisms may best ensure continued good progress on establishing the framework for recovery and growth.  I expect to make an announcement in that regard in the coming weeks, following consultation with appropriate interests.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I wish the Minister well in her new brief and look forward to working with her.I am surprised the implementation group has not yet been established.  We are only too well aware that the signals for this year, just like last year, are not good for the tourism industry.  The report of the tourism renewal group, published in September 2009, recommended an implementation group of no more than four members with an independent chair be established for an initial period until the end of 2010.  We are a third of a way through the year but an implementation group is still not in place.I accept bits and pieces of the recommendations are being implemented by various agencies but that is the very problem — it is piecemeal.  As well as that, these are survival not just recovery actions.  The second action, the abolition of the air travel tax has not been introduced.  Just yesterday, the Aer Lingus chief executive, Christoph Mueller, spoke again of its significance to the tourism industry.When will the renewal implementation group be set up?  Who will be its members, who will chair it and when can we expect real action from it?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I thank Deputy Upton for her good wishes and I look forward to working with her.The real point is when are we going to implement the recommendations set out in the survival and the recovery actions.  As I outlined earlier, some have been already implemented by the important agencies, such as Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, which have the responsibility for delivering them.Some of the recommendations, however, are dependent on other Departments.  The air tax issue, for example, falls under the remit of the Department of Finance.  As was debated last week on Private Member's business, from a tourism perspective one could argue it may be damaging to the sector.  Yet from an overall Government policy and the Department of Finance's view, it is seen as bringing in €125 million.  It is difficult to know from what source a similar amount would come if the tax were dropped.At this stage I have not decided if we need an implementation group, who should be on it or how it should be done.  I am anxious to press on with the recommendations.  If having a group will ensure that will happen more effectively, then I am open to considering its establishment.  I certainly will be taking a lead role in driving these suggestions.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	342	It is a waste of public money when a report is commissioned but no one wants to take on board its recommendations.  It flies in the face of common sense.  The group consisted of experts under the chairmanship of Maurice Pratt which came up with two sets of action — survival and recovery.  The former term concerns me as it implies there is a need for the industry's resuscitation.  If it is to survive, then these actions need to be implemented.I accept some agencies have taken on board some of them.  Is tourism a regular agenda item at North-South Ministerial Council meetings?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Tourism is an essential part of North-South co-operation which is why we are able to market Ireland as the island of Ireland.  My ministerial counterpart in the North, Arlene Foster, has a keen interest in this and I look forward to working with her.  I note Aosdána will hold its first meeting in Northern Ireland soon.  There is great potential for further co-operation on a North-South basis.The group recommended the need to re-affirm the value of tourism.  If ever a name-change re-affirmed the value of tourism, it is the change to the Department's name with tourism first.  It might seem to be semantics to some but it has genuinely re-affirmed the importance of the tourism industry to the economy and affirmed the work of the people on the ground.  From a conference at which I spoke this morning, Knowing and Growing North America, and from meeting the Irish Tour Operators Association last Thursday, we are seen to be working on some of the actions recommended by the tourism renewal group.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.The Irish Sports Council , ISC, funded by my Department, is the statutory body responsible for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport which includes responsibility for dealing with the recognised sporting organisations and allocation of funding to same.  The ISC was established on a statutory basis on 1 July 1999 and its functions outlined in section 6 of the Irish Sports Council Act 1999.The council recognises more than 60 national governing bodies of sport, through which funding is allocated on an annual basis following a detailed analysis of their application forms.  They are dealt with as autonomous organisations.  There is no current requirement for these bodies to sign up to the Just Sport Ireland process, established by the Federation of Irish Sports in 2007 as a specialised independent arbitration and mediation facility.From a legal perspective, I have no role in the day-to-day operations of the ISC.  Under section 9 of the Irish Sports Council Act 1999, it must have regard to Government policy and comply with any general policy directive which may be given by the Minister but it is not under my control.  The council is established as a corporate entity with legal personality and is responsible for its activities. I would be extremely concerned if moneys that otherwise would be invested in meeting the aims of the Government's policy on sport had to be used to meet the cost of legal settlements.  My predecessor requested a full report on the case referred to by the Deputies from the Irish Sports Council on 15 March.  I do not wish to make any further comment on this specific case until I have received and considered the Irish Sports Council's report, which I expect to receive in the coming weeks.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I am surprised the Minister has not received the report.  This is a difficult situation and has been the subject of court action, which causes great concern.  A great portion of €1 million, which should have gone to sports, has gone into lawyers' pockets.  It seems utterly needless that the dispute got to this point and if Just Sport Ireland had been used at a much earlier stage, it would have solved the problem.What is the value of a report commissioned from one of the bodies involved in the litigation?  To what extent can that be objective, with the best will in the world?  Given that the role of the Irish Sports Council in this has been the subject of litigation, will the Minister seek an independent report?  What is the point in the Minister hearing the Irish Sports Council side of the issue?  I do not want to rehash the issue but lessons must be learned about the way the Irish Sports Council interfaces with the governing bodies in sport.I accept there must be tension between the rights, autonomy and independence of the governing bodies and the need for oversight of how public money is spent by the Irish Sports Council.  It seems serious mistakes were made in terms of the relationship between the two and while any interference is not acceptable, it seems there was an unacceptable level of interference on this occasion.  I ask the Minister to seek an independent report so that lessons can be learned.  It is not a question of rehashing the case or apportioning blame but seeing what changes we can make to ensure this does not happen again.If the Minister does not know already, she will learn very quickly in this brief that we are only playing at politics compared to sporting bodies.  We have a lot to learn in terms of egos, ego trips, empire building and prima donna behaviour.  We are in the ha'penny place compared to the world of sport.  It is important we find out how we can improve the relationship between the governing bodies of sport and the funding organisations distributing money on behalf of the taxpayer.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I accept it is taxpayers' money.  Deputy Mitchell tossed out a figure of €1 million but nowhere was that figure mentioned — certainly not of that scale.  Irrespective of the sum, it is taxpayers' money and one must be accountable for it.  The report was sought on 15 March so I am not surprised it has not yet been presented to me.  When it is, I will carefully consider it and I will then examine the need for anything further arising from it.  There is a need to learn from this about the relationship between the Irish Sports Council and the governing bodies, about the interaction between them and whether other processes should be used.  I am always in favour of using mediation processes where they are available, irrespective of the difficulties.  Perhaps we can investigate whether national governing bodies should be using that method, given that it has been available since 2007.  These are the issues I will examine when I receive the report.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I refer to the issue of quangos.  A hands-off approach is taken; it is out there and we have no responsibility.  Of course there is responsibility but Deputies elected to this House cannot access the information directly from the Irish Sports Council.  We must go through convoluted routes to try to get to the root of it, and for the most part we fail.  The report from one agency involved in this, the Irish Sports Council — the body that receives money directly — will go to the Minister.  Will we have access to the report and will it be published?  As Deputy Mitchell stated, that is one side of the argument, which may have as many as three sides.  We had protracted discussions on this on Committee Stage and, from what we heard, it was an unsavoury scenario to say the least.  It is important that we did not get into the nitty-gritty because there were serious legal issues involved.  Whatever the amount, it is referred to in newspapers as being between €500,000 and €700,000, a vast amount of money.  At the same time, the Irish women's basketball team is not able to access a small amount of money in order to promote the team and do its work.  It seems an incredible disaster for sport that this amount of money is wasted in this way.I did not catch what the Minister said in regard to Just Sport Ireland.  Perhaps she said she had no role in this.  It is important there is a role for some agency in a matter where money ends up in the pockets of the lawyers.  Why can we not find another route and why can certain conditions not be applied to funding for an organisation in receipt of €52 million last year?  Sporting organisations will say it is not a large amount of money when spread over a large number of organisations, but it is a significant amount of taxpayers' money.  We have allowed something in the order of €700,000 to be spent on a legal case that should have been managed internally through an organisation like Just Sport Ireland.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	348	Just Sport Ireland is new to me but I am quite impressed by what it aims to do and the low level of awards granted as a result of mediation it is involved in.  I understand that body has been working with national governing bodies to ensure a provision for arbitration is included in rules and regulations as a matter of course.  Some 18 organisations have included the provision and it is a matter I am happy to promote so that they are get involved in it.  Mediation avoids the trauma of court, never mind the amount of money it costs and the awards that can be made.Given that confidentiality attaches to the case, I am not sure how much information can be made public.  I accept fundamentally that money destined for sports organisations and approved by the Government to support those clubs, sports and the promotion and development of sport should not be going into the settlement of court cases.  Anything that can be done to ensure proper and fair procedures to avoid that is something I would consider a matter of priority.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Athletics Ireland is the best funded of the governing bodies outside the three big sports.  The amount wasted in this case is twice the budget for our elite athletes.  They feel they have suffered as a result of this money being spent in this way.  Will the Minister consider it a requirement of governing bodies in receipt of public funding to have independent directors?  One of the reasons this problem escalated was that there was little independence.  Everyone was involved in a personal way and the members of the Irish Sports Council board along with CEO were formerly involved in the particular sport.  A little independence in the governing bodies, which is a requirement in other countries for those receiving Government funding, should be one of the issues the Minister considers following the receipt of the report, which I hope she will publish.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	350	We need to move on to the next question.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The Minister did not respond to Deputy Mitchell's query in regard to whether she would consider commissioning an independent report.  There are three groups involved in this matter.  Whatever the outcome, clearly a major problem exists somewhere.  What sanctions, if any, will be applied?  Somebody is clearly wrong.  There has been a total mess up, given that €700,000 of potential sports money has been wasted on a court case.  I would like to believe somebody somewhere will be held accountable for this.  We simply cannot allow this type of major public row or that people can walk away, go back to their desks and continue whatever they were doing previously.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	352	It is important to say that I understand the court case was strictly without admission of liability.  As such it will not be possible as a result of any report in regard to the handling of the case to ascertain whether any person should be sanctioned or penalised in any way.  The outcome of the case stands.  What is important is that we learn how we can avoid this happening in the future.  I will be investigating the Just Sport Ireland, JSI, initiative to see whether conditions in this regard can be improved.  I do not yet know the answer to that question as I am only learning about the process.  It appears it might have been possible to deal with this particular case that way rather than in the High Court, which would have resulted in savings of an awful lot of money.  I will examine the matter.  However, I cannot commit to anything until I have received the report which, in fairness, was only commissioned on 15 March.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	353	Is there any possibility of an independent report?  There are three groups involved, one of which is providing the Minister with a report.  The Minister's Department has direct responsibility for that agency.  What we need is an independent report reflective of the views of all three sides involved.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	354	What we want is a report that will provide guidance in terms of ensuring this does not happen again.  We do not need a report which will not tell us anything about the case because the settlement in that regard is confidential.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	355	That is precisely the reason the report needs to be independent.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The exercise is more of a learning experience for Government, the Sports Council and national governing bodies.  I will know more in terms of the lessons to be learned when I have received the report.  I will examine the Just Sport Ireland dispute resolution and mediation mechanisms and the various other issues raised here by Members.  I am open to suggestions in regard to how we can ensure this does not happen again.  However, it is premature at this stage for me to give commitments in this regard.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	357	Sport and physical activity has the potential to enrich the lives of all people and everyone of all ages and backgrounds should know that they can benefit from physical activity.  The value of sport and physical activity to the nation simply cannot be over-emphasised in improving our health, in creating a sense of identity and belonging and in boosting our morale.Sedentary lifestyles are widespread in Ireland and throughout the world.  The challenge now and for the foreseeable future is to extend people's health expectancy or years of life free from illness or disability.  Sport and physical activity can also be promoted as an alternative to anti-social behaviour.  More than this, it develops the personal skills of individuals.  Values such as tolerance, self-discipline, team spirit and strength of character are demanded, practised and promoted.  In this way, sport serves as an indispensable educational tool in schools, colleges and in the wider community.I am pleased to say that co-operation already exists between my Department and the Departments of Education and Skills and Health and Children, with my Department participating in several cross-departmental groups in this regard.  The Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport is represented on the children and young people's participation partnership committee, and on related sub-groups, to provide strategic oversight and direction for the work of developing and promoting youth participation.  The initiative arises under the national children's strategy and the committee is led by the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs.  It is also participating in the cross-departmental group to develop a positive ageing strategy, which is being undertaken by the office for older people within the Department of Health and Children.  The Department is also represented on a steering group developing proposals for an overall national substance misuse strategy.  The group is chaired by the Department of Health and Children and the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs.  Part of the strategy will relate to preventative measures and the subjects of sports and arts activities are expected to be included within this framework.The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Sports Council, ISC, which is funded by the Department, has a statutory responsibility for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport.  The Irish Sports Council, in pursuance of its objectives, works in partnership with the Departments of Education and Skills and Health and Children and agencies thereof.  Examples of such co-operation include the Buntús programme, the primary physical education in-service programme and the junior cycle PE support service with the Department of Education and Skills and the Buntús Start programme, the development of the national physical activity guidelines for Ireland and Get Ireland Active initiatives within the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.It is my intention to build on the existing relationships between my Department and the Departments of Education and Skills and Health and Children by encouraging closer collaboration and partnership in the development and implementation of strategies to encourage participation in sport and active lifestyles.

I was delighted to hear the Minister speak last week of the importance of tourism, culture and sport as a brief.  It is hoped she will get the support and backing she believes it deserves.  I also wish former Minister and Deputy, Mr. Martin Cullen, well on his road to recovery.  It cannot be said that there is a need for gender balance in this House in regard to sports issues.  The matter is in safe hands on all sides of the House.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	359	Perhaps the opposite is true.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Blessed are we among women.The tabling of this question was prompted by a discussion at a committee last week at which it was revealed that 4,000 people per annum in Ireland die of obesity.  This figure has risen from 2,500 some years ago.  The Health Service Executive officials stated at that committee meeting that more than half of all primary school children do not reach the recommended level of fitness.  Of concern was the frightening statistic that nine out of ten girls and seven out of ten boys are, on reaching 15 years of age, lacking in fitness.  In 1960, we had the leanest children in Europe.  We now have the fattest children in Europe.It was suggested at that meeting that the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport should work in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, of which the Minister is well aware, and the Department of Health and Children in ensuring we become a fitter and healthier nation.  The sports partnerships of the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport are doing fantastic work in my county and have been rolled out countrywide and could perhaps be rolled out to schools.The need for legislation from the Department of Health and Children in regard to food labelling has been mentioned often.  The traffic light system could be used in supermarkets to highlight those foods which are damaging to one's health.  There is so much that can be done.  While I accept the Minister has only recently taken up this portfolio, perhaps she will state if she supports that proposal and if she sees a benefit in banning vending machines in secondary schools, in particular those which contain unhealthy foods.The Minister referred in her reply to some of the schemes being implemented through the Irish Sports Council and so on.  However, there is so much more that can be done.  It is hoped that, as soon as the Minister gets her feet under the table, the effect of departmental co-operation will be evident in our nation and schools, although I accept children spend only a certain amount of time at school.   For example, it could be stipulated that where sports capital funding is provided to a school, such a school must be available after hours for activities.  Perhaps the Minister will outline in what other ways it will be evident at ground level that there is co-operation between the relevant Departments to ensure we become a fitter and healthier nation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I thank Deputy O'Mahony for his good wishes.  He is probably one of the few people in the House who has not asked me for tickets for an all-Ireland final.  He probably has access to them himself.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Yes.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	363	It is early days yet.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	364	He has better access.  I agree wholeheartedly with everything the Deputy said.  Everything points to the fact that the school years are critical.  Participation in sport during the school years, for all the reasons I have mentioned, is important and also gives a lifelong interest.  During my time as Minister for Education and Science I highlighted the fact that principals were telling children not to run in the playground.  I made a big issue of it to the extent that I advised parents that if children run they will fall, but it does not mean that somebody has caused them to fall and, therefore, there was no reason to take insurance cases.  It petered out.  It was just fear on the part of principals.Deputy O'Mahony raised the issue of vending machines, another matter which arose when I was Minister for Education and Science.  I recommended that where vending machines exist — many schools use them for revenue — there would be an option of healthy food.  The situation has improved over the years.  From my visits to schools over the years I have noted they now offer bottles of water and healthier foods, rather than fizzy drinks.  Perhaps that is the way to address the matter, rather than banning vending machines which schools see as part of revenue.On school facilities, in recent years there have been some tremendous programmes, in particular with new school buildings which have sports halls etc. attached to them.  Primary and secondary schools can also apply under sports capital funding if they show that at times when the schools are on holidays, which is quite a number of weeks during the year, the facilities would be made available to clubs for at least 30 hours per week.  That is already a condition of the scheme.  There is no point in having good facilities around the country which are not fully shared by the community.I see the interaction between different Departments on health activity issues as crucial.  As the Deputy said, the five minute speech I made on the day I was appointed Minister highlighted the fact that fitter, active children should be encouraged and the fact that people are living longer and need to be supported in activities, which can be accomplished through working with local authorities.On the issue of schools, I was chuffed that my first function in my sporting capacity was last Saturday when I presented the cup for junior camogie to my alma mater, the Presentation Secondary School in Thurles which beat Grennan College in Thomastown 6-10 to 1-2.  With two cousins on the team, I was particularly proud to be able to do it.  Whether they, like me, will continue with sporting activity or give it up, is one of the challenges.  The figures the Deputy mentioned are correct.  Girls are great for participation in primary school but by the time they get to 15 years of age they tend to opt out, so we need to support them through that.  Having sport and activity for all, rather than just competitive sport, is critical for children who are not competitive but need to be kept fit and active.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	365	Money spent and invested at an early stage in education and children is money which will be saved later on, in terms of cures which have to be put in place when people lose their health or it deteriorates.  We should not be put off by the fact that some guidelines which need to be implemented will cost us money.  They may cost us a small amount now but they will save a lot of money later.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I cannot disagree with the Deputy; he is correct.  It is important for young people, women's participation in sport and people with disabilities.  Many sports partnerships now have officers with specific responsibility for including such people.  There is great potential right across the abilities, ages and sectors for people to work together and promote the idea of a healthy lifestyle, of which sport is a part.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The tourism renewal group emphasised that it is essential to get costs, competitiveness and pricing right in order to compete effectively in tourism.  I am glad to see many State bodies that provide services to tourists are taking this advice on board in the initiatives they are taking and in their pricing policy for 2010.  For example, despite challenging financial circumstances, the Office of Public Works has announced that most seasonal OPW sites will open earlier in 2010 to coincide with Easter and that admission prices have been held at 2009 levels.The OPW is striving to maintain the balance between conservation, preservation and tourism needs and budgetary realities but nonetheless it has secured an extension of the season at a number of important regional sites.  I have no doubt my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is instrumental in seeing to that.  The Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism is working with the OPW to maximise the tourism potential of its existing portfolio of tourism sites.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is linked to the two Departments as it is a critical link.In keeping with the budget announcement on discounted travel to senior citizens, Fáilte Ireland, in conjunction with Iarnród Éireann, has developed a free rail travel scheme, the golden trekker, to boost overseas visitor numbers among a strong market segment for Irish tourism.  The scheme, which was launched on 16 March, provides for free mainline, commuter and DART rail tickets to all tourists to Ireland aged 66 and over and there is no restriction on nationality or country of residence.  We should also acknowledge that admission to the national collections at our national cultural institutions remains free of charge, which is not the norm in many European countries.Indeed, in 2009 the number of visitors to our cultural institutions exceeded 3 million, representing an increase on the 2008 figures.  Furthermore, access to the digitised on-line 1911 census, hosted by the National Archives and which has proved so popular with the overseas diaspora and will hopefully provide a boost to genealogical tourism, is free of charge.  In addition, the Department's own website, www.irishgenealogy.com which is making church records of births, marriages and deaths available on-line is also free.Fáilte Ireland provides free information to tourists through its various websites and a regional network of tourist information offices, visitor information points, and kiosks. This includes local and national information on things to see and do, what is on and where, route planning, dining and information on accommodation.  The new quarterly "Discover Ireland" publications, the festivals and events guide and the golf guide are available to tourists free of charge.  The spring edition of "Discover Ireland" includes a range of discounted offers in the accommodation, visitor attractions, golf courses and food areas.  A series of regional guides covering things to do and see is currently being produced and will be available free of charge through the tourist office network.  A series of local town maps is also available free of charge to tourist office visitors.Fáilte Ireland is also working with tourism businesses generally in 2010 to help them control their costs and make them more competitive.  During 2009, they provided training and business supports directly to almost 3,000 individual tourism businesses and, in 2010, will be investing over €11 million in the form of direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.  Business supports are aimed at assisting key tourism businesses to increase their international customer base, better manage their cost base, improve overall performance and sustain employment levels.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	368	That all sounds great.  I welcome the fact the Minister recognised the need for interaction between Departments and the various bodies responsible for tourism because it is a very fragmented industry in every sense, in terms of the industry itself and the bodies which look after it.  I could stay here all day and discuss the various areas in which other bodies are impinging on our efforts to attract tourists.  Today I received an e-mail from somebody who said he or she met an Indian tour operator who reported the difficulties it was having in getting visas for tourists coming to this country from India and that it had almost given up trying to send visitors to Ireland because it was so difficult.  It is costly and complex; there is no doubt about it.  I said the other day that by the time one has answered all the questions to which answers are required by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one has lost the will to live, much less to travel.Those are the kinds of things about which any Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism must be very concerned, even if it is not under his or her direct remit.  I hope the Minister will play a role in interacting with the other bodies.  One issue is visas, another is airport handling charges.  There is a real need for the Dublin Airport Authority to realise it must attract airlines and customers, something which one does not do by putting up prices.  If our airports are not efficient there will be no tourists coming into the country.  The DAA revised its charges recently as part of its preparations for T2.  A chauffeur company contacted me to say it is being charged €1,000 per year to park one car when it comes to collect tourists.  It should be the other way around.  It is providing a service to the airport.  There has to be recognition across all bodies that they have to keep prices down.I would like to think I had something to do with encouraging the Minister to ensure prices did not go up this year.  The OPW was the only provider to increase prices last year.The agency does a great job and I do not wish to be critical of its main function, which is conservation and preservation.  It is not a commercial entity and its officials do not see it as their function to be part of the national recovery drive, to attract visitors and provide a service to the public.  It is a sterile undertaking to refurbish buildings and not use them or make them accessible.  The fact that the OPW is not allowed to keep the income it generates from tourism means it has no incentive to encourage visitors.  Will the Minister consider — perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has a view on this — tendering for the operation of OPW sites and historic buildings in order that the upkeep remains a matter for the OPW and the operation of the sites and the provision of services, guides and so on becomes a commercial undertaking to encourage tour operators?  That would result in a different attitude and greater usage.  An ongoing complaint from tour operators is that the historic sites make life more difficult for them.  Will the Minister consider that?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The Deputy raised three important issues.  With regard to visas, people can travel from a vast number of countries without needing a visa but countries such as India and China have the potential to send many visitors to Ireland.  When people travel from those countries, they tend to spend a great deal of time in the country and a great deal of money, particularly in the regions, because if they travel this far, they want to see the country.  I have written to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the visa issue because it must be examined from the point of view of visitors who may have no connection to the country entering the State and, in particular, from the point of view of issuing North-South joint visas, which was raised in the House this week.  I have addressed this because it is important.  The Taoiseach when addressing the Irish Hotels Federation conference recently highlighted this issue and he said he would take an interest in it.  The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, visited China and India to promote the idea of students travelling to Ireland to be educated.  This could result in their families and so on coming to Ireland to visit them.  I am following up on this issue.The second issue raised by the Deputy related to the Dublin Airport Authority.  Airlines are critical to the success of the tourism industry.  Aer Lingus has requested a meeting and I look forward to meeting its representatives shortly.  I am happy to discuss all aspects of their business that impact on tourism.  There are still 100 flights a week between Ireland the US but capacity fell last summer and again during the winter.  However, the US economy has experienced a slight upturn, as has the Canadian economy.  There is great potential for additional flights and I look forward to marketing this further.On the OPW issue, I concur with the Deputy that its officials do great work.  However, as Deputy Mansergh just said to me, it is difficult to be free and commercial.  Free access is provided to these wonderful facilities.  I have always found the guides to be tremendous and the flexibility in opening times serves the tourism industry well.  Wearing my previous hat, I had hoped the public service generally and the OPW sites would be used for the graduate placement scheme.  There would be great scope for young graduates to work on OPW sites this summer.  They could bring great added value as they are well educated and trained.  Hopefully, following the agreement at the public service pay talks, this might be addressed and this could give an added boost to the good work done by the OPW.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I did not suggest access to the sites should be free.  They should be commercial and those running them should not behave like hospital administrators when they run out of money by putting up prices and closing wards.  That is what the OPW did when its budgets were cut.  If the operation of the sites was tendered, the OPW could keep the money and it would have a genuine incentive to encourage visitors.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	371	Could the over 66 free travel scheme be extended to include all CIE services, for example, because reports have highlighted that visitors in this age cohort stay longer and spend more money?  They could be encouraged to travel free, perhaps initially at off peak times, when it would not cost anything.The lack of integrated ticketing is annoying for many visitors, apart from the cost of tickets.  I appreciate this is not the responsibility of the Minister's Department but it is an important factor in encouraging tourists to spend time, for example, in Dublin.

I suspect the train scheme will be hugely successful.  Let us see how it goes and reflect on its potential.With regard to integrated ticketing — again I am wearing my previous hat — the new PPS card, which will be introduced later this year, will have a photograph, signature, etc. on it and it will be possible to use it for integrated ticketing.  That is the step which will enable such ticketing to take place.  That is a good example of interaction between various Departments.  Once it is in place, we will expand the scheme.

Today is a black day for Ryanair services at Shannon Airport because this is the final day of the five-year contract Ryanair had with the airport authority.  The company brought in more than 2 million passengers a year during the initial years of the contract, although that number had reduced to 1 million a year.  As a result, only a fraction of the numbers who used to travel to the west will pass through the airport.  Does the Minister realise that five years ago 30 destinations were served by Shannon Airport whereas today only ten destinations are served?  Will she bring together the main tourism interests in the region, in particular, the Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development, to redouble their efforts to fill the void left by Ryanair?  From tomorrow onwards, the departure halls in the airport will be empty unless the Government does something.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The Shannon Airport catchment area economic and tourism development plan is designed to support the region.

This is serious issue and I do not raise it for the sake of it.  The airport is almost empty every day after 11 a.m.  It is facing a bleak future and I ask the Minister to seriously examine tourism in the west, particularly in the context of short haul routes.  Only one short haul route with a limited service will be operated by Ryanair from tomorrow out of the airport and that will have a devastating effect on tourism operators in the region.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I am sure the implementation of the plan will help in some regards but I am happy to sit down with the representatives of Shannon Development to discuss the potential for the area.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The importance and impact of culture is an essential element of our identity, profile, confidence and place in the world.  I am convinced, based on the information available to me on those employed and engaged in the wider arts and culture sphere, that there is tremendous potential for enhanced opportunities to transform this landscape into the future.This optimism is driven and borne out by recent reports examining the importance of the arts, culture and creative sectors for the economy.  A DKM report produced last year stated that in the first quarter of 2009 employment in the arts and culture sector stood at 22,400, not including the indirect and induced employment multipliers.  DKM also estimated that the direct value added of the arts, culture and creative sectors combined in 2008 was €3.1 billion or 2% of total GNP.  Those are not just statistics.  They represent real, imaginative, enthusiastic and committed people all over the country deeply involved in their chosen artistic or cultural endeavour.  All of those contribute to the fabric of our cultural and social lives and make a difference in so doing.  It is vital that they continue to be supported and enabled to make a living from their talents.  We must value these attributes both from an economic, cultural and social point of view.On the economic front, over the past year and particularly arising from the global Irish economic forum held in Farmleigh, culture has come into renewed focus as a unique national asset and our greatest competitive advantage as a "door opener" in developing important economic and tourism links.  Culture Ireland will continue to ensure the ongoing promotion of Irish artists worldwide with the aim of generating goodwill and influence for Ireland and highlighting the strength of Irish culture and creativity.  In working in close partnership with other State agencies, including the Irish Film Board, Tourism Ireland and the IDA, Culture Ireland will focus on the opportunities to use our culture to bring about positive results in tourism and trade initiatives.  The recent appointment of Ireland's first cultural ambassador will enhance further the benefits of our cultural offering.In the context of my Department's role as the parent ministry for a number of agencies and institutions in the tourism and culture sectors, the cultural tourism initiative was launched in February 2009 to develop the exciting potential of cultural tourism, by focusing on increasing the extent to which the organisations under the aegis of my Department would combine their expertise and resources in this area.The cultural tourism initiative also facilitated closer co-operation between the State tourism agencies and the Irish Film Board to exploit the tourism opportunities presented by film and television production in Ireland.  The implementation and realisation of those and other initiatives are set to streamline the activities of those sectors and so help to highlight and harness the employment potential of the many attractions throughout the State.  In 2009, visitor numbers to the cultural institutions supported by my Department increased by 1% to 3.08 million.  The film and audiovisual sectors have consistently proven to be employment generating and profile raising areas of the cultural landscape.  The Irish audio content production sector review published in December 2008 demonstrated the employment of more than 7,000 individuals involved in more than 600 production companies, service providers and post-production companies.  There also exists a substantial freelance pool of highly creative, committed and flexible individuals and entities.For 2007, the audiovisual content production sector was valued at €557.3 million.  In 2008, the Irish Film Board production funding of €16.7 million for feature film, TV and animation helped generate production activity worth a total of €128.8 million.  That was an increase of 61.4% on 2007 figures.  Due to the consistent, high quality standards of work, connections and professionalism in the business and through the support of the Irish Film Board new projects continue to come on-stream.  The now continuous flow of prestigious international awards for Irish film-makers is crucial to bringing further business here.  The recent decision to locate a new production of "Camelot" at Ardmore Studios is further testament to this confidence and commitment which will generate and consolidate the engagement of those crews whose previous experiences will again be called upon.

What does the Minister intend to do specifically under each of the headings to which she referred?  I am conscious of the report to which she referred setting out the employment potential and existing employment in the general area of arts and culture.  Does she have a specific plan to identify each of the headings with a view to expanding, interacting and maximising the potential in all of those areas?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	386	My general policy on the arts, culture and the creative industry is to promote and strengthen it, increase participation and to see what added value we can get for the economy.  It would be easy at times such as this to look at all aspects of society from an economic perspective but I firmly believe that arts and culture, being a part of what we are, are of value in their own right.  It is an added advantage that we are able to use it as a marketing tool for this country to attract people to come here and to be able to add, for example, not only to cultural tourism, but also to our film industry.  I would be more than happy to do whatever it takes to strengthen and promote those sectors and industries.  I will give it all my energy and all my interest.Closer integration and co-operation between the various sectors is critical.  Reference was made to that previously.  Culture and arts cannot stand alone separate from tourism.  The integration of those areas, especially in the regions, has significant potential.  The same could be said of sport.  We have seen the advances that have been made in golf tourism.  There is more potential in that regard.  The opening of the convention centre this year has great potential for business tourism.  That is an area in which I foresee new opportunities attracting people.  Some of the first conferences to be held there are in the medical sector and they tend to be big spenders.Festivals have done significant work for communities.  They are important for the domestic market, which is also important.  The innovation that has been adopted by local communities around the country in creating festivals, which not only improve the spirit of their local areas but which attract people to them, has been admirable in recent years.  My plan for each of the different sectors is to promote, support, encourage and increase participation, and to do it for its own sake and also for the purposes of strengthening that industry for the economy.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I was pleased to hear the Minister refer to sport because I felt it was being ever so slightly neglected within the portfolio.  The question relates to culture and the impact it might have in terms of developing an interest in sport.  It is clear that there is a significant cultural impact in terms of sport in this country not alone with our traditional sports, but on a wider scale.  This country is recognised as a great sporting country.  We punch well above our weight in many sports.  That has significant potential not only for the economy, but in terms of our profile aboard as a sporting country.To return to culture, I was pleased to hear the Minister say it is not just about economics, that we have to look at the societal aspect of culture as well, which is clearly of great importance.  In an article by Mr. Fintan O'Toole, which the Minister might have read during the week, he referred to the west.  I put it to the Minister that there is a job of work to be done.  He said that at the moment the west is not translating its magnetic cultural image into the creation of such a region.  He considers the impact of creativity.  He indicates that in London one job in seven is in the creative sector.  In New England in the United States, one job in 25 is in the creative sector while in the west it is one in 33.  Purely from the point of view of the economy, the message is that there is significant potential in terms of opportunities for the creation of more jobs.  I do not say that is the only purpose of it.  There is the intrinsic value of culture and of the merit of the west as an example in its own right.  It is one that has an opportunity that can be developed and promoted.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	388	In his article Mr. Fintan O'Toole recognised that I am the Minister for everything that is important to us.  He is probably right in that.  What Deputy Upton said about sport is correct.  My answer was so long that I did not read it all.  Thomond Park, Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium, which will open on 14 May, are three major centres of sport that have the potential to attract a significant number of visitors to the country.  I accept that we have not fully capitalised on the employment potential but recent successes in the creative industry, for example, with the Oscars, are drawing attention to Ireland.  Successes include the Irish Film Board's attracting of "The Tudors" and "Camelot" to Ireland.The appointment of Gabriel Byrne as cultural ambassador is another case in point.  All these examples serve to market Ireland and challenge us to respond.  They challenge the west and every other part of the country to respond to the marketing initiative and the good press we receive.  They challenge us to offer good value, which is now available in Ireland, to ensure there is good quality and high standards and to maintain them at this difficult time for the sector.  The potential is great and I will be working on the means by which we capitalise on it with all the relevant groups.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 77 together.The foundation of Irish National Opera was announced recently and an interim board, chaired by Mr. Ray Bates, former director of the National Lottery was appointed.  The Irish National Opera will be based in Dublin.  It will stage opera on all scales in the capital and throughout the country.  The company will also encourage the development of opera through the provision of opportunities for emerging Irish talent and with education and outreach programmes that will encourage more people to engage with and attend opera performances.The new company will replace the two State-funded companies, Opera Ireland and Opera Theatre Company, which between them cover much of the range of artistic work expected from a national opera company.  At present, Opera Ireland produces main-scale opera in Dublin, while Opera Theatre Company produces smaller-scale opera, both in Dublin and throughout the State, in addition to operating outreach and education programmes.  The chairs of both companies, Mr.  Thomas Lynch and Ms Virginia Kerr, have been appointed to the interim board.The process of working towards the formation of a new Irish national opera company has been a collaborative one involving the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Arts Council, Opera Ireland and Opera Theatre Company.  My officials, together with the Arts Council, have met the new chairman already.  The high-level goals of the new company have been agreed.It is envisaged that the Irish National Opera will officially commence operation in the coming weeks.  Opera Ireland and Opera Theatre Company will continue their work throughout 2010, as agreed with the Arts Council, because both companies have been funded by the Arts Council to continue with their agreed respective artistic outputs for all of 2010.In addition to the chairman Mr. Ray Bates, Ms Virginia Kerr and Mr Thomas Lynch, the interim board of Irish National Opera includes Sir Brian McMaster, chairman of the National Opera Studio in the United Kingdom and former managing director at the Welsh National Opera.  To assist in transitional arrangements, the chief executives of Opera Ireland and Opera Theatre Company, Mr. Niall Doyle and Ms Kirsty Harris, respectively, have been appointed to the interim board for three months.At present, there are three opera companies in the State that receive annual funding from the Arts Council.  These are Opera Ireland and Opera Theatre Company, which I have dealt with, and Wexford Festival Opera.  Wexford Festival Opera has a distinct niche and a highly successful brand both nationally and internationally and is a very successful tourism generator for Wexford.  It is important that this brand be maintained in its present form and consequently there are no plans to change its funding or institutional arrangements.  That has also been agreed with the Arts Council.

What is planned for the overall body?  There is general welcome for a new national opera company.  Will the company be a cultural institution?  Will it be funded directly by the Department rather than the Arts Council, which funds the existing companies?  What will be the new company's terms of reference?  Will the debt of Opera Ireland be cleared before the setting up of the new company?  No new company wants to be set up with a debt hanging over it.

The basis for this decision is that the people in question did not pay PRSI contributions before they reached the age of 66 but section 110(2) of the Act states, "Notwithstanding subsection (1), the Minister may, where he or she is satisfied that in all the circumstances of the case it would be appropriate to do so, direct that subsection (1) shall not be applied in that case.”  The Minister is therefore within her rights to rescind her decision and prevent the hardship, worry and annoyance that she is causing, mainly to women, throughout the country; (11) Deputy Mary O’Rourke — the need to address the dangers posed by the proliferation of head shops; (12) Deputies John O’Mahony and Seymour Crawford — the need to have all overdue moneys, such as those payable under REPS 4, paid to farmers without delay; (13) Deputy Terence Flanagan — the need for the Minister for Finance to protect homeowners who signed contracts in the past few years and who are now being ordered by the courts to pay the full contracted price agreed several years ago plus interest and costs; and the need to consider that it will cause financial ruin for these home owners if the contracts have to be honoured; (14) Deputy Timmy Dooley — the need to review sentencing policy on aggravated burglary in the retail sector; (15) Deputy Deirdre Clune — the need to prevent the excessive loss of teaching posts at Togher girls’ national school and Togher boys’ national school in Cork; (16) Deputy Róisín Shortall — the negative implications for schoolchildren in disadvantaged areas of the proposed abolition of the supply panel; (17) Deputy Michael D’Arcy — the establishment of a methadone clinic by the HSE in a very inappropriate site at Civic Square, The Avenue, Gorey, County Wexford; (18) Deputy Thomas P. Broughan — the urgent need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to establish a commission of investigation to examine all aspects of the planning and building of the new north fringe urban district in Dublin North-East given the very serious fire safety concerns and appalling housing construction deficiencies which have arisen for new households there since 2007, and if he will make a statement on the matter; and (19) Deputy Joe  Costello — the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to transpose and implement EU directives within the timeframe provided by the EU.The matters raised by Deputies Charles Flanagan, Mary O'Rourke, Michael Ring, and John O'Mahony and Seymour Crawford have been selected for discussion.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Following an application by the Financial Regulator yesterday, Mr. Justice John Cooke in the High Court appointed Mr. Michael McAteer and Mr. Paul McCann from Grant Thornton to act as the two joint provisional administrators to Quinn Insurance Limited, under the Insurance (No 2) Act 1983.  They have already begun their work and have an on-site presence in the company.  They will oversee its actions and work with the new management.The appointment was made after the court was informed that the Financial Regulator had a number of concerns, including that the company had significantly breached its solvency ratios, its subsidiaries had entered a series of guarantee agreements which had reduced its assets by some €448 million and it had failed to deliver a financial recovery plan that met the Financial Regulator's requirements aimed at restoring financial health to the company.  In other words, the Financial Regulator had concerns about the way the company was conducting its affairs and concerns that it was not meeting the regulatory requirements.  In particular the company was unable to comply with the requirements of the Insurance (No. 2) Act 1983 in that it had failed to make adequate provisions for its debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities.  In that context, it is not suggested that it is not in a position to pay its debts as they fall due.  The ground referred to is that it is unable to make adequate provisions for its debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities.I understand the company's ability to comply with the solvency requirements was called into question on 24 March when the company's chairman, Mr. Jim Quigley, informed the Financial Regulator that certain subsidiaries of Quinn Insurance Limited had entered guarantees in connection with facilities made available to the Quinn Group.  This arose as the Financial Regulator was in discussions with the company about its financial recovery plan for the restoration of the insurer to a sound financial footing.  It was in the course of these meetings that the Financial Regulator was informed for the first time about the existence of the guarantees from the subsidiaries of advances to the Quinn Group generally.I understand that the facility agreements which incorporate the guarantees from four subsidiaries of Quinn Insurance Limited were entered into in 2005.  Three tranches of loan notes were entered into in October 2005, April 2006 and April 2007.  I also understand that four additional subsidiaries of the company entered into the guarantees in 2008.  The total guaranteed sum was €1.2 billion.  I emphasise that this is the total guaranteed sum and not necessarily the quantum of the guarantees.  I am informed that, following a meeting between the Financial Regulator and the company, it was revealed that the effect of the guarantees had reduced the insurer's assets by some €448 million and thus wiped out the company's solvency cushion.  It has gone from having a surplus of assets over liabilities of €200 million to a current position where it has an excess of liabilities over assets of €200 million.  The fact that these guarantees had been in place and not disclosed for some time was a matter of the gravest concern to the Financial Regulator.  This raised serious governance and accountability questions about the internal control mechanisms as well as the accounting and administration procedures and practices within the company.The Financial Regulator has commenced an investigation into these matters within Quinn Insurance Limited that have very recently come to light and we must await the outcome of this investigation.  I recognise that the Financial Regulator has taken the action to seek the appointment of the two joint provisional administrators in the best interests of the firm's policy holders and that the appointment will better protect policy holders.  It will allow the firm to remain open for business and to continue to be run as a going concern under different management, with a view to placing it on an ongoing sound commercial and financial footing.  This will assist in the maintenance in the public interest of the proper and orderly regulation and conduct of the business.The Financial Regulator has directed Quinn Insurance Limited to cease writing new business in the UK and that existing UK policy holders will not be affected by this decision as existing policies will remain valid.  The effect of this action is to prevent Quinn Insurance Limited suffering further financial losses from its currently unprofitable UK business.  I welcome the fact that Irish policy holders of Quinn Insurance Limited can continue to renew policies, carry out new business and make claims in the normal way.  Quinn Life business, which is a separate entity, is not affected by these measures.It is important to note that at this stage there is no requirement for additional funds from the insurance compensation fund as the administration is only of a provisional nature.  If the administration is confirmed on 12 April and should the administrator subsequently need additional funds to help him with the business, there is the facility of the Insurance Compensation Fund, established under the Insurance Act 1964.  This fund was used in previous insurance company administrations in 1983 and 1985.  This fund can be financed by a small levy on non-life insurance premium income in circumstances where the Central Bank is of the view that the state of the fund is such that financial support should be provided for.  This would arise in circumstances where, for instance, the administrator has made a claim and the Exchequer has been required to advance funds.  The maximum contribution from insurers is 2% of the aggregate income of the insurers in that year.In regard to the implications of this on employment, this Government takes this issue very seriously.  We remain acutely conscious that, while economic activity continues to remain weak, it is imperative that we do nothing to further erode private sector employment.  I am conscious of the contribution of the financial services sector to employment in this country and it is the Government's intention that this sector emerges from the current downturn strong, competitive and able to withstand any future downturns.With regard to the question raised by Deputy Bruton on the measures being initiated by the Government to correct any weaknesses in existing regulatory legislation, the Central Bank Reform Bill published yesterday is the first of a three-stage legislative programme to create a fully integrated structure for financial regulation, enhance the powers and functions of the Central Bank and consolidate existing legislation.  However, it should be said that as soon as the matters were drawn to the Financial Regulator's attention, he took appropriate action and ample legislative machinery was at his disposal to take such action.  The first Bill puts in place the new structure of the Central Bank.  The second Bill will enhance and extend the regulatory powers of the new Central Bank.  Should similar legislative changes be required to protect consumers of financial products provided by the insurance industry, these will be provided for in further legislation.I fully support the action of the regulator and I commend him on the promptness with which he has dealt with this matter.  It is essential that policyholders be reassured about the insurance company in question.

I understand Mr. Quinn has written to the Minister and all his colleagues.  In the course of his letter, he states that the action taken by the regulator was highly aggressive and unnecessary.  He claims it will make the repayment of outstanding debt extremely difficult and that it also endangers the 5,500 jobs in Ireland unless it is immediately reversed.  Will the Minister comment on those claims of Mr. Quinn in view of his answer?Second, will the Minister outline the precedents for imposing levies on policyholders arising from the 1963 insurance compensation provisions?  Will he state whether the levy would be applied to all insurance policies except life insurance and that it would include health insurance, or would health insurance also be exempt from the levy?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	398	First, with regard to the suggestion, which I understand was made in a press release circulated on behalf of the Quinn Group, that this was a highly aggressive and unnecessary action which endangers jobs, I make it clear that the regulator is acting in the proper performance of his functions.  That is what I and, I am sure, every Member of this House would expect him to do.The regulator has to ensure in a regulated industry of this character that the industry is being operated in a manner that can assure the policyholders their claims will be met.  That is an absolute duty which he is under.  This is not the first but the second occasion on which a difficulty of this type has emerged in regard to this insurance company.  Whatever we disagree about, in the context of yesterday's debate, there is a particular onus on the regulator to ensure a regulated industry like this meets whatever statutory standards are laid down.  Everything he has done in this context is to ensure those statutory standards are upheld.  That is my response on that issue.In regard to the previous operation of the insurance compensation fund, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, collapsed in 1985.  The ICI has since been renamed Icarom plc.  Compensation to meet certain of Icarom's liabilities has been provided through the insurance compensation fund by a combination of AIB funding, commercial loans and State loans, which have been since repaid.The collapse of the ICI did not require a levy on the industry itself.  The collapse of the PMPA, on the other hand, did involve a certain element of levy.  The Insurance Act 1964 made provision for contributions to be made to the insurance compensation fund from insurers, other than insolvent insurers, to meet the liabilities of insolvent insurers.  This provision was brought into effect by section 10 of the Insurance (No. 2) Act 1983 and set the levy at 2% of gross premium income.  It was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in October 1983.  At that time, there were not sufficient moneys in the fund to meet the liabilities of PMPA.  The levy was paid by all non-life insurers at this rate until 31 December 1991.  The rate was reduced to 1% from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992.  The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of the former PMPA.The position here is somewhat different in that we are at the stage where an interim appointment has been made returnable on notice to the court and, clearly, there is no call on the need for a levy at this stage.  When the administrator has conducted a preliminary view of the company in question, we will be in a better position to know exactly how to proceed.In regard to the question of health insurance, I am advised that health insurance and marine, aviation and transit insurance are excluded from the operation of the levy.

My primary concern, as I am sure it would be for many Deputies, is for the 2,800 employees of Quinn Insurance Limited in Cavan, Enniskillen, Navan, Dublin, Cork and in Manchester.  We recognise the Quinn Group is one of the biggest employers in the Border region and in the country as a whole.What is the Minister's Department doing in specific terms to secure and protect those jobs?  Will the Minister confirm the number of jobs involved in Quinn Insurance, which I have just indicated as being 2,800?  Does this square with his Department's tally?  Is the Minister concerned that the situation now presenting could affect other parts of the Quinn Group and involve further thousands of jobs?As Deputy Noonan noted, Mr. Seán Quinn has alleged that the appointment of the administrator endangers 5,500 jobs in Ireland — "endangers" is the word used in the text as reported in this morning's media.  How would the Minister respond to that claim by the Quinn Group?With regard to the Financial Regulator and the appointed administrator, is it a primary part of its remit that it would, as it should, take every step to guarantee to help ensure the safety of the jobs concerned in Quinn Insurance Limited, as the focus at this point in time, and the Quinn Group in a further sense if, God forbid, that were to be the case?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	400	First, I would like to put certain facts on the record of the House in regard to Quinn Insurance Limited generally, which might assist the House in understanding the significance of the company, the number of employees involved and the prospects of the company in the home market.  Quinn Insurance Limited has approximately 1.3 million policyholders — 920,000 in the State and 365,000 in the United Kingdom.  The total premium income is in excess of €1 billion and approximately 60% of that is sourced in the State.  The business is broken down into motor business, 52%; health business, 28%; general liability business,16%; and property and household business, 5%.  To take approximate shares of the Irish market, that represents 23% of the health market, 20% of the motor market, 3% of the property market and 10% of the liability market.  In regard to the United Kingdom business, that is split between motor business, 68%; property business, 6%; and liability business, 27%.Quinn Insurance Limited employs approximately 2,800 personnel in the State and the UK out of a total of approximately 8,000 persons in the overall group, which includes non-insurance business and a life company.  The Government is, of course, concerned about these jobs.  However, one cannot have jobs if one does not have a credible regulatory framework underpinning them and one cannot have jobs in a company that is not meeting basic statutory requirements.  Those statutory requirements have to be enforced.If we have learned anything from what we have discussed yesterday and since September 2008, it is the paramount importance of this point.  We must ensure that, in the eyes of the world, this insurance company is in a position to meet all regulatory requirements.  Clearly, the company has a large amount of business.  Clearly, the regulator had the confidence to go to court to ensure the company continues to carry on its business in the State, which is positive in terms of these positions and positive in terms of the continuity and jobs which the administrator wishes to see sustained in the company.  However, the Financial Regulator is under an obligation to ensure that the company is properly regulated.  He cannot be criticised on the basis that he is being aggressive and unnecessary in the context of the matters which I set out in my initial reply.

I ask him to comment.  Will he also indicate to the House the role of the administrators?  We understand the importance of regulation in terms of public confidence.  Is it part of the remit — as I had asked him — that they would also keep a careful eye to the importance of guaranteeing employment for the many people and their families who depend on this entity for their daily lives?

I was anxious in that context to underline the statutory functions of the Financial Regulator and to express my full confidence in him.  I do not accept the suggestion that this is a highly aggressive and unnecessary action.On the question of the risk to jobs and employment, the Financial Regulator, the administrators and I, are fully aware of those risks.  However, an estimation of those cannot be arrived at today.  I outlined certain facts about this company which show there is sufficient confidence in it to sustain it as a trading concern in the State on an interim basis and that is now happening.  In the forefront of the administrator's mind and of the Financial Regulator's mind, will be an anxiety to bring this matter to a conclusion as rapidly as possible with a minimum of disruption to the operation of the insurance company.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20835	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I share Deputy Ó Caoláin's concerns about both employment and the scale of this company which covers about one fifth of all insurance.  How could this business come to have been jeopardised by a practice that was going on over five years, according to the Minister's report?  This company had trouble of this nature in the past.  Would these transactions that occurred here have required regulatory approval?  Would such guarantees have required the approval of the regulator and were they ever sought?Could the issue of such guarantees have occurred within any insurance company without the risk management committee or the board being informed or without the knowledge of the auditors?  Who was under an obligation to reveal these transactions to the regulator?  Was it the obligation of the board, of the risk management committee, of the auditors?  This practice appears to have been of very long standing.  The Minister in his reply suggested it went right back to 2005.  Would those in receipt of these guarantees have had any obligation to report the source of the guarantees if they knew they were coming from funds set aside for meeting regulatory insurance cover?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Deputy Bruton will appreciate that the amount of information at our disposal at this stage is necessarily interim in character.  It is not possible to arrive at a final assessment on some of the questions he asked.  It is clear that when the regulator saw the difficulty, his immediate and proper instinct was to apply to the court to protect the position. With regard to the persons for whose benefit the transactions were executed, they are creditors of the general group who lie outside the insurance company position and in that context, any instruments executed for their benefit create rights in them outside the insurance company and deplete the insurance company's assets thereby.  That is the essential difficulty which has arisen here.  As to the parties who executed those transactions, that is an investigative matter for the particular companies in question.  As outlined in my reply, they are subsidiaries of the insurance company.As to the degree of regulatory participation or consent or assent sought, as I understand the position at this stage, no such asset or consent was sought and these transactions——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20835	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Or was required.

These transactions existed entirely outside the regulatory system.  Beyond that I am not in a position to go further this afternoon.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Like everybody else, I have two main concerns.  I am concerned for the policyholders that they continue to have confidence in their insurers.  I am also concerned for the many thousands of people employed by the Quinn Group, some of whom are on the insurance side and are in our constituency.The events he described seemed to relate to off-balance sheet contingent liability accounting relating to guarantees.  They go back to October 2005, April 2006 and April 2007 and were modified in 2008.  Is the Minister aware that the total guaranteed sum was €1.2 billion?  Will the Minister say if there is any relationship between this large total figure and the issues of the indebtedness of the Quinn Group to Anglo Irish Bank in the context of the Quinn Group having acquired through contracts for difference up to 28% interest in Anglo Irish Bank?  Are these events related and are they to be part of the subject of the investigation?A very distinguished retired Secretary General of the Department of Finance was a director of Quinn Insurance until he resigned in 2007, when he was to become chairman of the investment committee.  Reports in today's newspapers state that this company seems to have suffered losses on the investment side.  The insurance business is understood to be profitable but the structural lapses, defaults, are on the investment side of the company.  I ask the Minister if this is so.  If that is so, what about the report in today's newspapers that Mr. Quinn, the principal figure in the Quinn Group — he is the owner or shareholder as I do not know what is the structure of the group — made significant gifts of €200 million each to family members, in a company which was having difficulties on the investment side?  Was the regulator aware of this?  It has been the practice of companies within the overall Quinn Group to make gifts to other companies.  Gifts in tax law are for love and affection and companies do not usually gift.  Has this been the subject of any inquiry by the Revenue Commissioners and what is the background to this practice?The Minister indicated in his statement that one of the insurance companies is not permitted to take new business in the United Kingdom.  Quinn Insurance Limited is to cease writing new business in the UK.  Were concerns expressed by the UK Financial Services Authority about issues arising in that country?Everybody here is conscious that we are dealing with a huge employer in this country.  Yesterday we heard appalling news on our banking system but given Quinn's repeated mention over the past three years and more in connection with investments in Anglo Irish Bank, I ask the Minister to indicate whether it has a bearing on these developments.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	413	According to my information, the creditors in whose favour these instruments were executed did not include Anglo Irish Bank or parties associated with it.In regard to a former Secretary General of my Department, I have no information on that issue.  I am not aware that a former Secretary General was involved with the Quinn Group at any stage.As to gifts between companies, Deputy Burton is correct that tax implications may arise.   There would also be a fundamental incapacity for a company to make a gift out of its own capital.  However, this is altogether separate from the core question of a regulated insurance business which has to maintain its own capital levels.  This is where the difficulty arises for the regulator.On the Deputy's question on the United Kingdom position, I outlined the nature of the business in that country.  It involves routine insurance activities and is not unduly hazardous.  I understand the regulator took the view in his application that the UK operation was loss making in general and, therefore, it was not desirable to continue taking business there.  As the Deputy noted, he may have been influenced by a more general concern about a possible reaction by a regulatory authority in another jurisdiction but the administrator is happy to permit the bulk of the business located in this State to continue for the present and to apply to the court on that basis.  As I outlined in my earlier reply, the company remains in a position to pay policy makers and the concern for solvency ratios is contingent rather than actual in respect of any claim falling due now.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Is it contingent or off balance sheet?  There is a difference between the two.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I am using the term "special contingent" in the context of insolvency law and not in regard to balance sheet operations.  It is important to assure policy holders that their claims can be met as they fall due.  The basis for the concern about solvency outlined in the application to the court related to contingency rather than an actual position.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I thank the Minister for his frank and open responses to Deputies' questions.  I will not deal with the legal technicalities which others have raised because I simply want to describe the absolute shock with which the people of Cavan-Monaghan reacted to this administration decision.  Few others have ever done as much as Seán Quinn for that region.  I welcome the guarantee by the Minister that policy holders will be safe but I also ask him to do whatever needs to be done to protect the jobs created by the Quinn Group in its insurance and other operations.  Maintaining these jobs, which are vital to my part of the country, may require the intervention of more people than the regulator.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I concur with Deputy Crawford.  I visited one of the main units of the Quinn Group which was located not far from where the Deputy lives.  Hundreds of young people from counties Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Donegal and Sligo were working in open plan offices in an atmosphere of high morale.  If these jobs are put at risk in any way, it would be devastating for this part of the country.  The letter from Mr. Quinn states that 5,500 jobs may be put at risk.When an administrator went into ICI, the number of employees at the company was reduced from 2,500 to 800 by the time it was sold off and trading profitably as a private enterprise.  If it is legally possible to do so, I ask the Minister to communicate to the regulator and, through him, the administrators that this House regards the preservation of employment as a priority.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I am very concerned for the policy holders and employees.  Why is it only now that the Financial Regulator has intervened?  Any insurer would have to answer the question of whether it has the appropriate solvency cushion and is not compromised by guarantees to other subsidiaries.  That insolvency and contingency cushion is vital in health insurance companies, which is the area I know best.  Can the Minister explain how this was overlooked until now?  Given the strict regulation under which the health insurance market supposedly operates, it is extraordinary that this issue did not come to light earlier.In regard to the group's health insurance activities, the Minister informed us that the excess of liabilities over assets now stands at over €200 million.  Every hospital that provides a service for a patient who is insured by Quinn Insurance must be concerned about the potential credit risk.  Can we expect that hospitals will seek upfront payment from the company?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I am not trying to lecture the Deputy when I say it is important to understand that the issue does not pertain to assets and liabilities but to the ability to pay obligations as they fall due.  The statement in my earlier reply on assets and liabilities is the current position on solvency buffers as a result of the information which came to the attention of the Financial Regulator.  The company remains in a position to deal with its obligations as they fall due in this State and that ability will be maintained.  The Deputy rightly asked why the basic solvency cushion has disappeared.  This happened because of the conduct which the regulator became aware of last week and he has taken prompt action in response.  Detailed investigation remains to be conducted on the precise nature of these transactions, in whose benefit they were executed and who was aware of them.I have already communicated to the regulator the concerns raised by Deputies Noonan and Crawford and I am confident he will outline to the administrator our desire to safeguard employment and activities as much as possible.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	420	We are all concerned for policy holders and employees.  I welcome the statement that the levy will not affect health insurance policy holders.  Can we be sure that the morass that surrounds many of these issues does not confuse the possibility that they lead back to Anglo Irish Bank?  I hope the Minister will be able to revert and give us an assurance on this matter.I welcome that the regulator is being proactive but has it considered the situation in respect of the VHI, which is not solvent by the 40% figure demanded by the regulator currently and which has diversified into other areas?  Are the Minister and the regulator satisfied no cross-subsidisation is taking place in that company?  Will the Minister comment on the need for a 40% solvency fund for insurers in this country when a 25% fund is the norm elsewhere in the EU?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	421	Are there any particular obligations in respect of the auditors in dealing with the accounts of an insurance company?  It is a very difficult and different set of accounts than those of any other business.  Does the Minister agree there should be a responsibility and that a certificate should be issued every year by the auditors to the Department or the regulator indicating clearly satisfaction with the type of reserves such a company holds?  Does the Minister agree that there should be some restrictions on insurance companies in respect of the type of investments in which they may invest because of the unique nature of the business?This may be a matter for the Minister's colleague, but will the Minister contact his colleague in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of the capacity problem?  If some 20% of the motor market was held by Quinn Insurance, is the rest of the market capable of taking up that 20%?  There may be a capacity problem from the point of view of someone who holds a policy with Quinn Insurance.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I refer to the employees and the policyholders.  It appears there are eight subsidiaries of Quinn Insurance involved in providing guarantees for facilities.  Will the Minister elaborate on exactly what form these facilities took?  Were they in the form of bank loans or otherwise?  Normal practice would dictate that if they were in respect of banks, bank letters would be sent to the bank every year and the guarantees would be disclosed in those bank letters.  That would represent normal practice.  Will the Minister elaborate on exactly what form these particular facilities took and their nature?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I refer to Deputy O'Donnell's question.  The hearing will take place in the High Court on Monday, 12 April.  That will provide the regulator with an opportunity to make a fuller case for the appointment of the administrator.  It will allow Quinn Insurance to either address the concerns of the regulator or counter them.  The court will then have to make its decision on the evidence submitted.  The nature of these transactions will require investigation in that context.  The suggestion to date has been that they were in the nature of a pledge or a security of such type in respect of the documents in question and the court must evaluate that.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position today to provide information to the House about matters before the courts which await determination there.I refer to Deputy Barrett's query.  I shared his response to the question of the large amount of physical and unrealisable, relatively illiquid assets involved in these subsidiaries.  This is a matter we must examine for the future.  However, in respect of the question of accountants, I refer to the point I have already made.  The hearing will take place before the courts on 12 April and I have no wish to prejudge that in respect of to what extent accountants did or did not know of these particular transactions.Deputy Reilly raised concerns about the health insurance market, which is not affected by the levy.  His concerns related to the solvency ratio that operates in the health market.  I must refer that to my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, because it is a question for another market and the way in which that is regulated.  All these markets require a basic solvency assurance.  I am aware that in the context of the VHI we have had some obligation throughout the years but it has not been as onerous as it could have been had international standards varied to a greater degree.  As Deputy Reilly is aware, significant issues exist in this regard.  Is there another query outstanding?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I asked about capacity.

In page 5, line 15, after "2005" to insert the following:"AND TO AMEND AND EXTEND PART IV OF THE HARBOURS ACT 1996".I propose to take amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 107 together.  The purpose of amendment No. 107 is to include an amendment to the Harbours Act 1996.  As a consequence of amendment No. 107, amendment No. 2 is required to amend the citation in section 1.  Amendment No. 1 is required to expand the long title to reflect the amendment to the Harbours Act 1996.By way of explanation, Deputies will recall in our debate during the passage of the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2006 that the issue of compulsory retirement for marine pilots upon reaching 60 years of age arose.  I had hoped to address this issue during the passage of that Act but, as I outlined during the debate, several complex issues were identified during discussions between my officials and the Office of the Attorney General.  The matter required further examination but I am pleased to indicate now that we are in a position to bring forward this amendment to remove the compulsory retirement provision for marine pilots at age 60 years.As I outlined in the previous debates on the matter, a key area of concern was the need to maintain the highest standard of maritime safety, especially in light of the vitally important role our marine pilots play within the shipping industry.  Deputy Broughan raised this issue in particular.  As well as removing the provision of compulsory retirement at age 60 years, the amendment introduces a new section to the Harbours Act 1996 which would require all marine pilots to satisfy the relevant port company that they meet the required standards of medical fitness deemed necessary to carry out their duties.  Furthermore, the section states these examinations should be carried out not less than once every two years, which is in line with the medical requirements imposed upon seafarers generally.  I am satisfied that the removal of this compulsory retirement at 60 years of age provision together with the medical fitness requirements will help to ensure not only that capable marine pilots are allowed to continue in work beyond 60 years of age, but that the crucial demands of navigational safety will be met.The introduction of the provision requiring medical fitness standards in the profession mirrors the current situation and practice where such requirements are common place.  It was also one of the recommendations of the investigation into the Bro Traveller incident in Dublin in 2005.  The report recommended that port companies implement the IMO, International Maritime Organization, pilot resolution A9.60 on which medical health requirements are based.  The section also provides for the suspension of a pilot from duties should he or she not meet the required medical standard.  The amendment provides for an appeal process for both licensed and employed pilots should their licence or employment be suspended or revoked.  The appeal process is similar to an existing appeal process contained in section 73 of the 1996 Act with regard to the suspension or revocation of a pilot's licence.  Amendment No. 108 tabled by the Labour Party proposes to address the matter by substituting "65" for "60", but the Deputy will agree that the way we are doing this is probably better because it does not create any limitations except health ones.

This is a contentious matter because many pilots felt that they were being unfairly discriminated against.I commend the Minister for listening at the time that we debated the Harbours Bill, when he gave an undertaking.  He has come forward now with this formula, which, as I understand it, will be probably the way of the future in that if one is fit enough to do the job, age does not enter into it.  This is the way matters are progressing.The original amendment I tabled on the age of 65 was proposed by the pilots' association.  However, I welcome the amendments and I thank the Minister.  It is often stated that being in Opposition is a fruitless task, but sometimes Ministers listen.  On this occasion, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, listened and I welcome that.  It will be good for those who work in the area.

In page 7, line 4, after "Oireachtas" to insert "for approval".This is a standard amendment that we, in the Labour Party, often table to major new legislation.  Often we are unhappy about the way materials are laid before the Oireachtas.  We are suggesting that every order, regulation and rule be laid before the Oireachtas for our approval.There was an interesting example of this recently when it was reported in the media that Opposition Deputies had received a copy of the latest Kelly report on the Dublin Port tunnel which commends or apparently gives a clean bill of health to the NRA, but I have never seen this document.  It is an important issue which my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, has raised on many occasions at the Joint Committee on Transport.I ask that the Minister consider this small amendment, under which we would have to give approval to major changes in the legislation or to regulations introducing major elements in far-reaching legislation.

No doubt if the roles were reversed I would be getting the same answer from him.It is not considered necessary to go through this particular procedure for secondary legislation.  The section provides the standard element in the process, that either House may within 21 days pass a resolution annulling the secondary legislation instrument if it does not approve of the order, regulation or rule that is being made under the Act.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.

In page 8, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:"(e) the flag under which the vessel is registered;”.These amendments relate to each element of the Bill on the flag state.  As the Minister will be aware, on Committee Stage I tried to move amendments relating to the flag and, in particular, to try to get rid of flags of convenience.  The essence of my amendments, which the Ceann Comhairle ruled out at this Stage, was basically to make flags of convenience illegal in so far as it affected our trade or ships going off our register.As the Minister will be aware, it has been a long discussion.  I launched that Bill, which, I think, is still on the Clár and was on the Clár of the previous Dáil.  Obviously, it relates to the long years of suffering by maritime workers, those who carry out 99% of our trade, of bad wages and bad conditions.During the previous debates on this issue, I particularly commended the work of the late Mr. Tony Ayton of SIPTU and the International Federation of Transport Workers.  Mr. Ayton spent a large part of his life trying to invigilate vessels coming into our waters and carrying out our trade in the major ports, such as Cork, Dublin and Waterford, and generally trying to improve the lot of maritime workers.We had a major debate on all of these matters, which the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, dealt with in his previous ministry in 2005 when Irish Ferries moved to sack 543 workers and outsource the work to workers from Eastern Europe on massively degraded pay and working conditions.  Anybody who uses the ferries regularly, as I do, will find that there have been significant changes in working conditions in the major ferries connecting Ireland with Britain.There was also the long saga of the notorious MV Normandy where they were working for four months in total on a ship and then being forced to take three weeks’ unpaid leave.  There were also serious allegations brought before this House about the MV Defender, which is berthed in Irish waters and whose crews, allegedly, were owed thousands of euro in unpaid wages.I note that Mr. Ayton's successor, Mr. Ken Fleming, of the international transport federation and SIPTU, has continued to campaign vigorously on this matter.  In this Parliament, I want to support strongly his efforts.  As he told the Irish Examiner a couple of years ago, he found mass exploitation, effectively slave labour, of foreign national seafarers coming to our shores carrying out the vast bulk of our exports and imports, and he felt that major action needed to be taken against it.The Bill deals mainly with carriage rules, construction rules, etc.  However, I felt it would be important, given that it is a major merchant shipping Bill, to try to include some prescription on flags in it.  Ireland is a maritime state and we should begin to take a leading role on this issue.  Even where we are bringing into force the international conventions such as SOLAS and the maritime convention, we should begin to set a few headlines and move towards ending the days where states such as Mongolia, the Bahamas, Cambodia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines — perhaps 30 countries — are where so much of world trade is allegedly, unofficially or illegally based, and where the end result is desperate suffering for maritime workers.  That was the reason I introduced the Mercantile Marine (Avoidance of Flags of Convenience) Bill in 2005 on behalf of the Labour Party to try to tackle these flags of convenience.Although I accept the Minister will probably state that is the reason we cannot put this type of prohibition into the Bill, I ask that at least we would provide for a requirement that the flag of the vessel be an element of the Minister's considered powers in all the matters before us in the Merchant Shipping Bill — in other words, that the flag would be an important issue and that perhaps later on, if the Minister attends the maritime convention which will follow from this Bill being passed in this House, he might state that Ireland is one of those countries, perhaps the first, to take a strong role in the matter of the misbehaviour and ill-treatment of workers by the misuse of flags, and particularly these notorious flags of convenience.I strongly urge the Minister to accept all of these amendments, first and foremost, in the memory of the great Tony Ayton and his campaign to make Ireland a headline country in the matter of the abuse of workers on the seas which is happening right this minute to tens of thousands of workers, especially from Asia and Eastern Europe, and that we take a step today.  I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 4 and all the other amendments to this effect throughout this Bill.

While I have no problem accepting the principle of what Deputy Broughan has said on the matter, this is not the Bill for this particular type of amendment.  As a fellow Trim man, I know of the work of Tony Ayton in this area.  Nothing will give me greater pleasure but to be as progressive as we possibly can on these matters when we debate ratifying the Maritime Labour Convention.  I accept Deputy Broughan is committed to the amendments' intentions.  However, they are very separate matters to those covered by this legislation.Amendment No. 4, concerning the flag under which the vessel is registered, may actually defeat its intended purpose if accepted since we have no regard for any flag or otherwise.  This Bill will apply the rigours of the inspection system to every ship regardless of whether it is registered.  Inserting this amendment will not strengthen this legislation.The concept of the flag of convenience is not actually formally recognised anywhere.  The officially recognised system in both the EU and international organisations for identifying high-risk systems is the black, grey and white list of flag states, published by the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control and available on its website.  The list is used so that urgent safety inspections can be carried out on ships visiting Irish and European ports.  Details of the inspections and detentions carried out under the port state control regime are also published on the Department's website.The Maritime Labour Convention will consolidate and update 68 existing International Labour Organization, ILO, conventions and recommendations adopted since 1920.  Countries that do not ratify the new convention will remain bound by the previous ILO conventions that they have ratified.  There is a major incentive for a ship to register under a flag of good repute so as to avoid the potential of having a large number of inspections and detentions.We will deal with the matters the Deputy has raised directly when ratifying the Maritime Labour Convention, hopefully before the end of the year.

Originally this started as one Bill and has been merged with various others, making it very difficult to follow the amendments and the amendments to the amendments.Amendments Nos. 83 and 94 refer to codes of practice and fire safety rules.  It would be an enhancement of the Minister's powers if he accepted these amendments to invigilate against ships under flags which repeatedly give trouble with the bad treatment of workers, fire safety standards and so forth.

In page 9, line 30, after "installation" to insert "including full microwave and video links".These amendments relate to our discussion on Committee Stage.  Perhaps the Minister will reassure us that the radio installation referred to includes full microwave and video links.  The Minister will recall I gave the example of the race into Galway of the Green Dragon, which appeared on our televisions from 700 miles off coast.  I wonder if these are conditions in relation to construction and so on and if at each stage radio installation does in fact include full radio-video installation.  A key point is that vessels could be in constant contact.  We heard recently of progress being made in microwave radiation in regard to aeroplanes.  I note the Ryanair service in this regard appears to have been withdrawn.  Given the spread of microwave and radio communication, I ask that the Minister reassure the House that the full gamut of radio-television-video is included in the phrase “installation” which is used repeatedly in the Bill.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I can give the Deputy the reassurance he requires.  The term "radio" is included in the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act 1952.  The Deputy is proposing to insert references to full microwave and video links in respect of the type of radio equipment to be used and to require that video logs be kept.  Section 15 of the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act 1952 provides that ships to which the radio communications rules apply must be provided with radio installations of such a nature as may be prescribed by the rules.  The existing statutory provision is left broad and generic and does not preclude any particular type of radio communications equipment.  Consideration will continue to be given when the radio rules are being made to prescribing the appropriate types of radio installation for the purposes of merchant shipping law.  The existing term "radio installation" is not defined in the 1952 Act.  The term, therefore, is sufficiently broad to include electromagnetic microwave and video modes to which the Deputy refers.  It is not necessary to be more prescriptive in the primary legislation by including a definition of the term "radio".  For this reason, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment and reassure him that what he is seeking is already covered.In addition, radio rules may prescribe requirements for the keeping of a radio log book.  Consideration will be given when the rules are being made to prescribing the appropriate communications modes recorded by radio logs for the purpose of merchant shipping law.  This relates to the Deputy's request to have video records kept.  Again, it is not necessary to be prescriptive in the primary legislation in respect of the recording medium to be kept on a vessel's radio log.  The intent of the Deputy's amendment is fully met and can be strengthened further when we come to addressing the radio rules.

In page 11, line 2, after €100,000" to insert the following:"or ten percent of annual turnover whichever is the greater".These amendments were also discussed on Committee Stage at which time I stated my belief that the fine of €100,000 was perhaps too restrictive for the State and should be considered in the context of the development of modern regulation.  The Minister may recall my discussion with him when Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in relation to how UK regulators in communications have the remit to fine an errant type communications up to 10% of turnover.  I believe the same approach should be adopted in regard to marine companies.  We should be able to hit them hard if they break the construction or carriage rules which run throughout this Bill.  It should be possible for regulators to impose a serious fine through the courts system.  We all remain devastated having heard yesterday's reports from the Minister for Finance, as is the public.  The nub of that issue was the total and abysmal failure of regulation on one level and the non-existence of regulatory powers.  We should try to remedy this for the future.  In this case, in terms of misbehaviour in the marine industry, we should go for 10% of turnover of companies that seriously misbehave.  I urge the Minister to accept these amendments.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I indicated on Committee Stage that I would consider for Report Stage the inclusion of the formula of 10% of annual turnover as a factor in determining the maximum monetary fine a court could levy.  The Deputy mentioned on Committee Stage that a penalty based on a percentage of annual turnover features in some judgments and law.  As the Deputy correctly stated, we both have experience of passing such legislation.Having considered the matter, all of the advice is that while there is no objection in principle to this, it would have to be done in a careful and measured manner.  When taking actions, we would have to consider issues such as it being feasible to accurately assess relevant annual turnovers in all cases arising in this sector, that a court would be in a position to use the annual turnover formula to determine in a timely manner the maximum monetary penalty available to it and to ensure the introduction of the annual turnover factor would not result in unintended consequences or inequitable or inadequate penalties.  Also, it would be necessary to put in place new legislative and court administration procedures to quantify the annual turnover of a company and, where applicable, of individuals including masters and owners who are convicted on indictment.The appropriate accounting period or periods would need to be identified in the legislation and the courts would need access to audited accounts.  A problem could arise due to different accounting and certification practices in different jurisdictions.  The introduction of the measure in this Bill would mean the annual turnover factor would only apply to a small number of offences provisions, while other offences provisions which are provided through the Merchant Shipping Acts will continue to provide for a specified maximum monetary fine for which a person will be liable.  We would introduce an anomaly into the Act.As a result of the complications, more time will be needed to inform the policy making process to assert if any ramifications could arise in other areas.  I propose to wait until the consolidation of the merchant shipping legislation has been undertaken in my Department and then try to apply, as appropriate, uniform measures across the new statute.  In that context, we would consider this.  I propose to maintain the provisions as published and ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendments.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I congratulate the new Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Coughlan, on her recent appointment.  The appointment brings with it the opportunity for a much needed rethink on the issue before the House tonight.  The current strategy of the Department of Education and Science in removing special needs assistants throughout the education system is causing havoc and must be stopped at once.  It is simply wrong and unfair and the Minister has an opportunity to right that wrong tonight.It is time the Department of Education and Science started to listen to what is going on in schools all over the country.  It is time that the voice of parents of special needs children was listened too.  It is time for a fresh start.  That start could begin tonight by this House accepting this motion and freezing the current review of SNAs.  It must also start with a new attitude from the new Minister for Education and Science, which I hope we see tonight.  This is an emotive issue.Children with special educational needs were for far too long ignored within Irish education.  In recent years we have come a long way.  New legislation and new resources have made it possible to offer parents a chance that their child can be in a mainstream class like anyone else.  Children with recognised mental, physical, sensory or intellectual disabilities have found a new home within our primary and post-primary education system.  It is estimated that more than 190,000 children with special needs are in Irish education.  As the school population grows and as further assessments are made that number will increase over the short to medium term.  The demand is rising, not falling.The choice is not between wanting more or fewer SNAs, rather, it is whether we want inclusion in Irish education.  That is the fundamental choice and issue at the heart of this debate.  One cannot have inclusion without SNAs.  As the Government reduces the number of SNAs, so too does it reduce inclusion in Irish education.  We do not have a choice if we are to respect the legislative and moral responsibility to include special needs children in our education system.Yesterday, this State once again bailed out the banking system with mind boggling amounts of money.  That money belongs to you and me and to future generations who will have to pay it back at some time in the future.  At a time when we are recapitalising the banks, is it not morally indefensible that the Government stands over the abolition of SNAs to the most vulnerable children in Irish education?  That is what is happening in mainstream and special schools all over this country.  I want this debate to clearly set a marker for the National Council for Special Education which is currently reviewing the number of SNAs.The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and those who support the Government in this House should stop hiding behind the NCSE.  They should stop running for cover as they let an unelected body make the wrong decisions over and over again.  I regret saying this, but the truth is the performance of the NCSE at the most recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science was not only pathetic as key questions went unanswered, but highlighted that the review from the start was hopelessly inconsistent.  On that occasion Government and Opposition Deputies and Senators spoke with one voice.I expect authorities established and funded by this House to answer directly questions that Members of the Oireachtas want answered.  That did not happen two weeks ago and it was an absolute disgrace.  It is now time this House came together in supporting this motion tonight and stopping what is clearly a defective review.  Ultimate accountability must be seen in this House and we should not allow a quango or an unelected body to make decisions of this magnitude in our schools.  We are ultimately responsible to the Irish people for the actions we take and those taken by other bodies.The Minister has the power to do something that her predecessor singularly failed to do — start listening to teachers and parents on the ground.  How can the Minister, or anyone else for that matter, stand over SNAs being removed in the middle of a school year?  Some schools have seen dramatic reductions in SNAs with four months to go before the end of the school year.  A lot of time goes into developing relationships and trust with children with special needs and they often find change difficult and confusing.  Halting the current review is essential in order that some credibility in the decision making process can be restored.Our motion freezes the current review and demands that we revisit the SERC criteria of 1993 before re-establishing the review.  Much has changed in 17 years and too many schools believe that a narrow and restrictive interpretation of the criteria is being made on a daily basis by the NCSE.  Even in 17 short years much has changed in schools.  Schools are more complicated and sometimes very challenging behaviour from children must be dealt with.  How can the Government stand over the review when it has been proven to be so defective?  In effect, the review was changed midstream as initially no appeals system was in place to challenge the decisions of SENOs locally.  Now we have an appeals system that is not independent, as senior people within the NCSE review the decisions of local SENOs.  How can anyone stand over the independence of that appeals system?Any court in the land would drive a coach and four through any argument made by the NCSE or the Department of Education and Science on the question of the consistency of the report as it applies to children, when it manifestly changed on two occasions during the life of the review.  There is a judicial review just waiting to happen and I would not like to be the Department of Education and Science in defending such cases, if and when they come before the courts.  Our motion demands that where an SNA was removed to date it should automatically follow that a proper, independent review be held which would, in effect, allow a look back on the decisions already taken.  This is the least we should expect from the system.The failure of the Government to implement the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and to publish a costed multi-annual plan as promised in the renewed programme for Government once again highlights the priorities of the Department of Education and Science.  The Act was supposed to be the legislative basis for supporting children with special needs in Irish education before it was thrown overboard by the Minister's predecessor.  Deputy Stanton will speak further on this during the course of the debate.We will also need special schools and indeed special classes within mainstream education for many years to come.  Last year the Minister for Education and Science effectively knocked out over 100 special classes in mainstream schools before the NCSE was able to formally advise the Minister.  The latest research from the NCSE on special classes and special schools paints a very different picture from the rationale for closure the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, painted to the House last year.  What is most appalling about special schools, and their role within the system, is the dramatic reductions that many of these schools have experienced in SNA supports.  Some have been subject to a 40% reduction in SNA support in the middle of the school year.  In reducing the SNA supports to these schools, the Department is saying to their children that they should find a school elsewhere.Yesterday, the Government saved the banks with billions of real money.  As that was happening the SNA review continued all over this country, cutting back on people who make inclusion work in schools.  Our young people did not create this mess, yet they are being asked to shoulder a heavy burden for the mistakes of others.  How anyone can stand over the deliberate and systematic demolishing of special needs supports to our children is beyond comprehension.  Tonight, we have a chance to make a stand.  Deputy Coughlan, as a new Minister for education, has an opportunity to listen to Members, something her Department and her predecessor have not done.  I hope we use the debate to begin that process.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	453	It was an exciting time in the House in 2003.  We had a fantastic debate on the EPSEN Act and for once there was hope that children with disabilities and special needs would be looked after.  The then Minister for Education and Science opened his contribution to the debate on the legislation with a quote from John F. Kennedy who said: "Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation."  The Minister went on to say these words applied to all of us but, in particular, to children with special needs and disabilities "who are at risk of being marginalised and suffering disadvantage because of their special educational needs".  I agreed with him that early intervention and appropriate supports were vital if children with disabilities were to reach their full potential.  All children get one chance at education and children with special needs, in particular, deserve that chance.The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated in 2003: "The EPSEN Act raised issues of fundamental importance to our society.  It is essential we offer equal educational opportunities to all.  Its purpose is to introduce clear and applicable legislation to ensure educational rights for children with disabilities are respected."  He said it went beyond the Equal Status Act 2000 and the Education Act 1998.  It was a time of great excitement.  Many people were interested and there was significant debate and interaction.  Despite the promises and commitments provided for in the EPSEN Bill and the previous Education Act and the great hope we had then, little has changed since legislation was enacted in 2004 and it remains largely unimplemented.  When it was introduced, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said he would provide for a five-year timeframe for its implementation.  He said it was "realistic, ambitious but achievable".  Unfortunately, he was wrong.Only a few sections of the Act have been implemented to date.  It means sections 3 to 18, inclusive, and sections 38 and 39, which deal with the meat of the legislation, including the right to assessment, provision of services, preparation of individual education plans for children with special needs, appeals of decisions, allocation of resources, appointment of liaison officers, planning for educational needs, implementation of educational policy by the HSE, delegation of functions to principals, provision of mediation services and the duties of the HSE in regard to school age children, remain unimplemented.  The initial five-year timeframe for full implementation by 2010 will not be met and a decision was taken in April 2009 to postpone indefinitely the implementation of the Act.  The rights and needs of children with special educational needs are being put on hold while the State's resources are pumped into zombie banks.  How could anyone say that this is fair?The only two sections of the Act to have been implemented relate to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the Special Education Appeals Board, SEAB.  The board was only established in April 2007.  It comprises three staff and it has been allocated €330,000 over the past three years.  The board has not been allowed to hear any appeals, yet the Government has pumped almost €330,000 into it.  How can the Minister justify this?  I have been informed that the board is carrying out research, preparing papers and so on, but its primary function under the legislation is to hear appeals.SENOs have been given significant responsibilities when they visit schools.  They are required by the Minister to adjudicate on the needs of children and whether they should have the support of SNA.  No independent body had the power to review their decisions until recently, which is almost unprecedented, and it is unfair on SENOs that they have to play God in all these cases.  Will the Minister allow the SEAB to carry out the functions the Act and the House envisaged it would?  Parents have no recourse to an appeal, which is unfair.A few weeks ago NCSE officials appeared before an Oireachtas committee and advised that at the end of February they established a review process whereby SENO decisions from that date could be internally reviewed by a senior SENO if an appeal was lodged within five working days.  The timescale is extraordinarily short and the SENOs are acting as judges in their own courts on important matters.  Between 20 and 30 appeals were received within two weeks.  This clearly shows the significant demand for an appeals process and I hope the SENOs will allow for retrospective reviews of decisions taken.  That should also be the case.  The NCSE has also decided to establish an independent advisory committee but this will be a case of too little, too late for many children and their parents because I understand this will only be put in place next October.Will the Minister examine the role and duties of SNAs because they should be clearly defined and updated?  For instance, they examine the care needs of children.  The criteria have remained unchanged but they are being implemented strictly and this has led to the cutbacks in schools.  For example, if an SNA helps a child to turn a page in a book or points out where is the script, that is considered to be education and he or she cannot do that.  It is that strict.  We need to examine the role of SNAs because they perform a vital role in schools.  Everyone would be happy if a fair and independent appeals procedure was in place.  That is crucially important because that does not currently exist.  In almost every other sector where decisions are taken, it is possible to appeal.  For example, decisions on social welfare benefits and planning applications can be appealed but SENO decisions cannot.All of us who were involved in shaping the EPSEN Act, including the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey, wanted to ensure an appeals process would be in place.  It is bad enough that only a few sections of the Act have been implemented.  The legislation needs to be implemented in full.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, well in her new job but I appeal to her to address this.  She has a feel for what is going on in this area and I hope she will take this issue by the scruff of the neck and be fair about it, especially for children with real special needs.When drafted, the EPSEN Act was entitled the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill and the Title was amended to widen the scope of the legislation and to soften it.  As Deputy Hayes said, this issue affects the most vulnerable children.  It is wrong and unfair for the parent of a child with special needs to be told that the SNA on whom his or her child depends is being taken away and the parent has no recourse to appeal or cannot talk to anyone about it.  It is a case of "good luck and goodbye".  That is most unfair.  Perhaps the Minister would at least pursue that issue.  If we achieve nothing else tonight but that, we will have achieved something good.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I commend Deputy Brian Hayes on bringing this timely motion before the House.  I wish the Tánaiste well in her new portfolio as Minister for Education and Skills.  This is the first test of her support for children with special needs.  The appointment of special needs assistants to meet a child's care needs has been a significant development in education and a great benefit for children with special needs.While the role of a special needs assistant is clearly defined in the Department's circular, 17/02, as it relates to the child's care needs, it also relates to the child's educational needs.  Special needs assistants are recruited specifically to assist in the care of children with special needs in the educational context.  Only when the child's care needs are properly addressed can the learning process take place.  I urge the Minister to consider the damage already done by her predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and to stop the review process now taking place as a result of which children are being denied their basic rights.  Neither the Minister nor his Department were aware of the disruption caused within schools as a consequence of the reviews and cuts which followed.  Special needs assistants play an indispensable role in meeting such needs as mobility, communications and medical procedures so that children can get the maximum benefit from education in their school.If a child with special needs does not receive an appropriate education he or she will be marginalised within the school community and in society later.  For a child, his or her school and parents, the loss of a special needs assistant in such an arbitrary fashion is fundamentally unfair.  The loss of a special needs assistant could hamper the right of parents of children with special needs to fully participate in their child's education.  Will the Minister adhere to the demands of the EPSEN Act 2004 which clearly identifies "that people with special educational needs shall have the same right to avail of,  benefit from an appropriate education as do their peers who do not have such needs, to assist children with special educational needs and to leave school with the skills necessary to participate to the level of their capacity in an inclusive way in the social and economic activities of society and to live independent and fulfilled lives"?Investment in the special education sector must remain a priority.  I urge the Tánaiste to immediately freeze the review process.  The people who carry out the reviews are seen as departmental hit-squads denying children with special needs their entitlement to an appropriate education.  The Irish Primary Schools Network suggests that approximately 10% or 1,200, special needs assistants will be made redundant for the sake of saving the Department approximately €30 million a year in response to the demands of an bord snip.  Let us measure that sum against the development of a child with special needs, his or her improved confidence, ability to integrate into society and to be respected.  Let us also measure the peace of mind given to the parents and families of such children.  Let us compare the sum of money in question with those mentioned in yesterday's debate on the banking system.  A total of 1,200 loans were brought into NAMA yesterday and 1,200 special needs assistants were made redundant by the Department.  Will the Tánaiste reconsider what has been done?  I urge her to instruct the NCSE to cease the reviews.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I am pleased to make a contribution to the debate.  I commend Deputy Brian Hayes for bringing the motion forward at this time, which is appropriate as schools around the country are getting the result of the reviews on their special needs allocation and feeling the effects of the cutbacks.  We heard at first hand in committee in recent weeks the harrowing stories of mainstream and special schools whose allocations have been cut drastically.  Not only that, but the changes have to be implemented in the middle of the school year.  Never before, even in the harshest of economic times, have teachers been taken away from pupils in the middle of the school year.The Government amendment before us tells us that the criteria of the Department have not changed.  If that is the case and all of the schools were reviewed less than a year ago when the present allocations were deemed appropriate, prior to the recent announcements, how could so many schools have lost so many posts?  Members on all sides of the House are aware of such schools.  It is difficult to come to any other conclusion than the fact that the purpose of the review was merely to cut numbers and to save money.  As many of my colleagues have indicated, the review was ill thought out and no appeals process was in place until the review was half finished.  There is no independent appeals board.  The body that makes the initial judgments also adjudicates on appeals.St. Anthony's special school in Castlebar will lose three special needs assistants under the review that has recently been carried out.  Along with my fellow Deputies on both sides of the House I have attended meetings with parents, staff and children where we heard harrowing stories of the effects of the proposed reduction in the allocation of special needs assistants.  Everyone acknowledged the progress the children had made in recent years and explained that to lose their special needs assistants now in the middle of a school term would do irreparable damage to the future of the most vulnerable in our society.  Deputy Flynn has rightly acknowledged and articulated the need for the reversal of the cuts at St. Anthony's and has reinforced those arguments at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science.  I hope that she, with the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, considers that carefully when they casts their votes on the motion tonight.It is ironic that the motion comes the day after this House voted billions for the recapitalisation of the banking system.  The Government has rammed through megabucks to cover for the mistakes and greed of the most powerful and reckless people in society.  Will the Government and its Deputies deprive the weakest, most vulnerable children in society who cannot speak for themselves when it would only cost a fraction of what was gifted to our most powerful last night?I wish the new Minister well in her post.  I appeal to her to bring fresh thinking to the area.  This is an issue that transcends party politics.  Progress has been made in recent years and the cuts will destroy that progress.  We will not be forgiven if we do not shout "Stop" now.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, for introducing the motion.  I also congratulate my county colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, on her new position as Minister for Education and Skills.  As she is aware, we have 403 special needs assistants in County Donegal.My colleague, Deputy Stanton, articulated a point about the EPSEN Act which I will not repeat but the Act is the cornerstone of any future system of integrated education in terms of special needs support.  That is where the focus has to be.  The Tánaiste should take that point on board.  Any of the practitioners to whom I have spoken, be they special needs assistants, principals or teachers have indicated that the EPSEN Act is critical to getting a proper structure in place to facilitate special education.Positives will emerge from the review but negatives will also be evident.  The role of special needs assistants has to be reviewed.  We should use them as a resource, not as the Government is currently doing in terms of budgetary cuts because there is insufficient money to retain the present complement of special needs assistants.  We should also learn from their experiential learning and the valuable work in which they have been involved.  Every time I meet SNAs in my clinic, I find they have a new angle, see new opportunities and see where the weaknesses are.  The SNAs are critical to any review to be carried out.Parents of people with disabilities or special educational needs are no different from those with a child that does not need support.  They have the same aspirations, ambitions, hopes and dreams regarding their children getting an education.  We need to specify that special needs supports are not just about care because we need to differentiate between care and education.Dr. Robin Eames said at a sermon in Armagh approximately two years ago that education is what is left when everything else is forgotten.  We are only passing through and must pass on the educational tradition.  I reiterate that education is what is left when everything else is forgotten.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I thank my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, for bringing this important matter before the House.  The withdrawal of SNAs and classes from schools with pupils whose integration into mainstream education is dependent on such provision is unbelievable and must be reversed this evening.  To remove this help flies in the face of logic and basic decency.  Is the Minister suggesting "the survival of the fittest" should become the new educational mantra?  How exactly does the Minister picture the future of children left to cope in a school environment that is alien to their needs?The Government has a shameful record of targeting the most vulnerable in society.  However, even by its standards, the act of hitting out at highly dependent children is certainly the lowest of the low.  What do we expect it from other than a Fianna Fáil-led Government that bailed out the dodgy bankers and builders yesterday?Under the Constitution every child is entitled to an education.  However, to achieve their full potential, some children need special help.  The push to integrate special needs children into mainstream education has always been open to debate.  With many being left to sink or swim in an environment that is not tailored to their needs, that debate is now intensifying.Special needs classes in mainstream schools give children the chance to avail of the specific help they need while benefiting from the social and educational environment of the school.  However, parents and students who availed of such special provision were given no warning of the cutback.  The axe is falling in the middle of the academic year with no appeal mechanisms.How can one ever begin to imagine the anguish of the parents we met and those in every constituency who have in good faith entrusted the education of their children to the State?  They were assured by the Government that their children would be looked after within the system.  As recently as last month, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said, "This Government has delivered for children with special needs."  I am not sure whether he believed his own spin or whether he had totally lost touch with reality.  The latter option would certainly appear to be the case in terms of the doublethink on the part of the Government.  While SNAs are being withdrawn from schools, it is contended there is no question of posts being removed from schools where they meet the scheme's criteria.  Numerous schools in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath have lost an SNA to the detriment of their pupil profile, which has not changed.I am very disappointed with this Government.  I hope the hypocritical politicians on the Fianna Fáil side, who were outside the gate this evening, vote for the Fine Gael motion.  I compliment our spokesperson on education, Deputy Brian Hayes, on bringing the very important motion before the House.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Like the other speakers, I firmly believe all children have a right to education.  I am sure Members on all sides believe this.  It is the delivery of education to children with special needs, physical and mental, that requires support.  The former Minister for Education and Science stated in the Seanad recently that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities places a strong obligation on Governments to provide inclusive education for all learners.  He said it requires states to ensure that "persons with disabilities are not excluded from the general education system on the basis of disability" and that "persons with disabilities can access an inclusive, quality, free primary education and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the communities in which they live".  The essence of tonight's motion is ensuring inclusive education for all.We have come a long way in terms of supporting children in obtaining their educational entitlements.  That we have so many SNAs employed in our schools and a facility whereby children can gain access to and participate in mainstream education in addition to having their own special classes is evidence of this.  However, the withdrawal of SNAs for children during the past academic year is the subject of tonight's debate.  It was on the minds of those outside the gates of this House earlier today.One should consider the role of SNAs in supporting children and young adults in school.  Assisting pupils to board and alight from buses and assisting them with difficulties such as clothing and feeding sum up the role of an SNA.The parents and principal of a child from whom an SNA is withdrawn should have a right to an independent appeal.  The appeals process should be put in place.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise that all children deserve an education and an opportunity to realise their full potential, regardless of where this lies for them.  For some, this may involve a leaving certificate and, for others, it may just be an opportunity to gain valuable social skills, which is extremely important.I appeal to the Minister to examine carefully the wording of tonight's motion.  It is carefully structured and certainly spells out the need to implement the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which has been neglected.  It will go a long way towards ensuring full inclusivity for children.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	459	As a parent, I know only too well the high price people with special needs pay in later years if, as children, they are denied access to education, therapy and treatment.  Society pays a price also because, when children are deprived of an opportunity to maximise their potential, they end up in a range of institutional care situations, including prison, unfortunately.  If they do not end up fully dependent on the State, they end up at least more dependent thereon than they should be and than they need to be.Not alone could nobody make a moral case for what is taking place, nobody could make an economic case for it.  A Government that reverses pay cuts for senior civil servants and sanctions pay increases for bankers should not target disabled children and children with special needs for the most penal of cuts.Every scheme should be reviewed, but in this case it is not a normal, ongoing review; it is a review with an agenda.  Unfortunately, nobody seems to know what the agenda is because there is zero transparency associated with it.  Nobody knows what the review is trying to achieve and where it will end.  Having got rid of special classes in mainstream schools, it seems the aim of the Government is now to get rid of special schools.  Why?  Does the Government seriously believe all the children now in special schools will survive in mainstream schools given that they are in special schools in the first instance because they could not survive in mainstream schools?  Neither could mainstream schools cope with them; that is the reality.Whatever chance the children have of surviving in special schools, they have no chance of surviving in mainstream schools without an SNA.  The bottom line is that they will not survive.  They will drop out, regress and become the statistics about which we do not want to know.  They will become the statistics on homelessness and prisons.  What are statistics for us represents absolute heartbreak for the children's parents.  It is all in pursuit of a policy that we do not know anything about, since it has not been articulated.  I now hear that the secondary schools have been informed that any school that has a teacher over the quota after September must either get rid of him or her, or an SNA.  What school will get rid of a science teacher to save an SNA?  The reality is that the SNA will lose his or her job and the child will lose his or her future.The Minister cannot stand over what is going on.  This review has no clear criteria, no benchmark, no published objective, no appeals system, no transparency and no accountability.  It is really just a hatchet job on the most vulnerable in society and she must listen to the terms of this motion, and at least put a stop to it for now and have an appeals system put in place that has retrospection.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I compliment my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, for bringing this very opportune motion before the House.  As a general observation, we have to come before this House too many times in terms of issues to do with special needs.  I wish the Minister well and she has an opportunity to set out, in a defining moment, precisely what her incumbency as Minister for Education and Skills will be about.  We have to look after people with special needs.Many students and parents are here today from across the length and breadth of the country.  Countless numbers of people are coming to me in my constituency, Limerick East, who are extremely worried about SNAs being withdrawn from their children.  Inspections are ongoing, some of them have got the results while others have not.  The Minister has to make a commitment tonight to put an appeals process in place and ensure that children can achieve their optimal capacity.  As a parent, the Minister can appreciate that this is what is required.  We cannot have a situation where if an SNA is withdrawn from a child, he or she will regress.  The child will have been allocated the SNA, at the outset, to ensure that he or she could achieve optimal potential.  Therefore, this is imperative.On a final point, some €8 billion has been put into Anglo Irish Bank by the Government since 21 January this year.  That is equivalent to the Minister's entire budget in one year.  The Government needs to get its priorities right.

I very much look forward to the challenge this portfolio presents and to playing my part in the development of education, training and skills policy over the coming months and years.Our young people hold the future social and economic progression of this island within their grasp.  Equipping them with the fundamentals necessary for the society and economy of tomorrow is a pivotal element of the work of any government.  This Government's commitment to education, training and skills, and as the engine of that progression, is firm.The approach on this side of the House is one that values the contribution and potential of all our young people according to their ability.  It is for that reason I am particularly pleased to move the counter motion this evening.  In Government, we have a strong and proud record on special education and I am glad that in my first full week as Minister for Education and Skills I have the opportunity to state my commitment to according a priority to special education during my tenure in Marlborough Street.Needless to say, the debate also affords me the opportunity to correct some of the misinformation and misrepresentation that has accompanied public comment on special needs resource allocation in recent times.  It is of some disappointment to me, but of little surprise, that the Opposition motion this evening is disingenuous.  Its tabling, however, gives me an opportunity to assure all parents of children with special educational needs that their children continue to have access to an education appropriate to their needs.I know that special education, and some of the points we are debating this evening, have also been discussed at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science.  The committee has written to my Department following that meeting and I have requested that a response issue to it in a timely manner.  This Government recognised many years ago that education for children with special educational needs in schools can only be delivered through consistent, ongoing, multi-annual investment in teachers, special needs assistants, assistive technology, specialist equipment, adapted school buildings and special school transport arrangements.  We also recognised that outcomes for children with special educational needs can be enhanced by providing guidance, support and training to the professionals who teach them.We have done much more than simply recognise these challenges, however.  Over the past ten years in government, we have prioritised investment and delivered a full range of supports for schools and students.  In fact, one ninth of my entire budget — €1 billion — is being spent in this area of education alone.  This is the most significant statement of our level of commitment and, despite the current economic difficulties, funding for special education has not been cut.  We know that children with special educational needs benefit from additional teaching support.  For that reason, we fund more than 8,600 resource and learning support teachers in our mainstream primary and post-primary schools.Children with disabilities often have care needs that cannot be met by the class teacher.  For that reason, we continue to fund more than 10,000 special needs assistants in our schools.  Pupils attending special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools, benefit from having smaller class sizes.  For that reason, we fund lower pupil-teacher ratios — in some classes there may be no more than six pupils with a teacher and a minimum of two SNAs.  We recognise that some children with highly complex needs have greater support requirements and there is flexibility in the system to enable individual SNA posts be allocated.  I am aware that some school principals have recently been critical of the teacher and SNA ratios recommended in the SERC report.  It is important to recognise that these ratios represent the minimum allocation of both teacher and SNA supports to special schools and special classes.  The flexibility of the current support mechanisms facilitates the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, in tailoring individual levels of support to individual pupils' needs.  Schools are not restricted to SERC recommended levels of support.  I want to clarify that.In all, there are now more than 20,000 adults in our schools whose sole role is to support children with special educational needs.  As well as teachers and SNAs, we continue to provide assistive technology, specialist equipment, adapted school buildings and special school transport arrangements.  We have responded to the need to provide teachers with continuing professional development in special education.  This has been a key priority in recent years.  Establishment of the special education support service, SESS, to provide expert support, professional development and training opportunities in special education for school staff has been significant.  Last year alone 23,602 training places were provided.  This training is designed to ensure a quality teaching service in our schools, one that promotes inclusiveness, collaboration, and equality of access for students with special educational needs to educational opportunities.  In addition, more than 300 teachers have availed of places on post-graduate teacher training programmes related to special educational needs.Despite the ongoing economic difficulties, and in spite of competing demands for funding, our renewed programme for Government commits to further investment in the development of services for pupils with special educational needs.  This is a significant statement of intent at a time of reduced public spending.  The renewed programme provides for 500 teaching posts in schools over the next three years over and above additional posts that will arise due to demographic increases.  I am pleased to advise the Dáil this evening that 100 of these posts, at post-primary level, are being used to improve the learning support service in post-primary schools.The renewed programme commits to the expansion in the number of psychologists employed directly by NEPS to 210.  This will ultimately allow for the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to every primary and post-primary school in the country, with particular emphasis on special needs units, classes and special schools.  There are currently 157 psychologists employed within the service.  This is an increase from 127 at the start of the current Government's term.  In the meantime, this Government continues to ensure that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments, either directly through the assigned NEPS psychologist or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments administered by NEPS, which supports the cost of assessments provided by a panel of private practitioners.I know the education sector is disappointed that the current economic difficulties have prevented the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, EPSEN, and I share that disappointment.  However, the renewed programme re-states the Government's commitment to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.  A significant number of sections of the Act have been commenced, principally those establishing the NCSE and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.  In the interim, I am committed to developing a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the Act, focusing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs.  This process will require consultation with the education partners as well as the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Department of Health and Children.  My Department has already commenced discussions with the HSE and the Department of Health and Children about the realisation of this plan.The office of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health is aware of the need to co-ordinate disability services across both departmental and agency lines.  For the first time, the Government has established an office, headed up by a Minister of State, with specific responsibility for disability and mental health.  An integrated approach has been adopted by the education and health sectors under the auspices of a cross-sectoral team to target additional resources to areas of greatest need.  This co-ordinated approach will ensure delivery of the most effective response for children living with disability and special educational needs on a daily basis.  The HSE will continue to work with funded specialist providers and in co-operation with the education sector to address the health related needs of children with special educational needs in the context of the resources available.  Progress is being kept under review by the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and the cross-sectoral team.We are also enhancing the capacity of the National Council for Special Education to co-ordinate the provision of services to children with special educational needs.  The NCSE has appointed 12 senior special educational needs organisers to co-ordinate the work of the locally-based special education needs organisers, SENOs.  Sanction has also been given to recruit further SENOs to improve the service the NCSE provides to children, parents and schools.I have outlined the substantial commitment of the Government to providing for pupils with special educational needs.  However, this does not mean that resources allocated to schools are left in those schools ad infinitum, even when the relevant pupils have left.  I note the Opposition motion calls for a freeze of the current review of special needs assistants in schools.  Does this mean the Members believe SNAs should be kept in schools even when the children have left?

I appreciate that schools would like more teachers, more SNAs and more funding.  However, resources must be targeted at those children who need them.  Resources left in areas within the school system that are not in accordance with relevant criteria mean that these resources are not available for other deserving areas.I wish to be clear on some key issues.  The SNA scheme has been a major factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.  The SNA scheme will continue to be supported.  The terms and criteria for the SNA scheme have not changed.  Schools that have enrolled children who qualify for support from a special needs assistant will continue to be allocated SNA support.  During the period of the current review, the NCSE has allocated over 1,300 new SNA posts to schools.  This is happening at present.  The NCSE has been processing applications from schools for SNA support all year, and this will continue.  There is no question of posts being removed from schools where they meet the scheme's criteria.In the course of recent discussions there have been suggestions that my Department had given a target to the NCSE for reducing the number of SNAs.  That is absolutely not true and there is no foundation to such a claim.  The NCSE has merely applied the criteria that have always existed.  This could have resulted in additional posts, as it did in many schools.  In other schools there was a reduction either on the basis that the children had left or their care needs had diminished.As the Deputies are aware, the purpose of an SNA is to support the care needs of children with disabilities, not to create dependency.  Therefore, a child with a disability in junior infants at age four or five can be different from one in fourth or fifth class, aged ten or 11, and very different from an 18 year old leaving school.  I fully recognise that some children with disabilities will always need support in school.  However, many children with disabilities develop independent living skills as they grow and mature.  Does the Opposition believe that no children with special educational needs are capable of developing independence?

Where a child develops to such an extent that he or she no longer needs that support, that is something to be celebrated.  There is a downside for the SNA, however, in that their role with regard to that child becomes redundant.  That reality is, however, part and parcel of the work life of SNAs.  Therefore, do the Opposition Members believe that this significant level of State investment should not achieve one of its main aims?  The content of the motion proposed by the party opposite would lead one to believe, depressingly, that the answer to these questions is "Yes".

I believe the Deputies who have tabled this motion could not agree with that proposition.With regard to SNA posts where a child has developed independent living skills, this is a more sensitive issue.  I understand the calls for changes not to be made in the course of a school year.  However, we must put the child and their development first.  It is not generally in the interests of the child for the NCSE to leave an SNA in place where a child has developed independent living skills.  To do so has the potential to impact on a child's personal development in a negative way.

This was to assist schools who may not have been able to access the relevant professional reports at the start of the school year or who had new pupils with special educational needs enrolled during the year.  Accordingly, the addition or reduction of special needs assistant posts throughout the course of the school year has always been a feature of the SNA scheme.  The NCSE has adopted a flexible approach where a school encounters particular transitional difficulties, for example, in the case of students with diminishing care needs where a number of SNAs are leaving.  In such cases, it can allow a longer transitional time and I have asked the council to continue this practice and to keep its protocols in this regard under review.It is important to ensure there is a consistent application of policy in the allocation of special needs supports across the country.  That is what is happening at present, and I do not intend to freeze this review.  While a small number of schools remain to be reviewed, the NCSE will publish the outcome of the SNA review to date on its website this evening.  The overall position is currently as follows: 920 SNA posts were freed up as it was found that the students to whom the posts related had actually left the relevant school; over 1,300 new SNA posts have been sanctioned; and 733 posts were freed up because students had diminished care needs.  While the overall number of SNA posts nationally is down 3.5%, this is mainly as a result of schools retaining posts when the child to whom the post related had left the school.  There was no change in the level of SNA support in just over 1,500 schools.  A total of 579 schools received an increase in their allocation of SNA support, while 832 had their allocations reduced either because the students had left the school or due to the student's development of independent living skills.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	485	Approximately 900 schools do not have an SNA.  These figures belie any contention that there has been a serious diminution of the levels of SNA support.  They also highlight the inaccuracy of exaggerated claims that the review would result in thousands fewer SNAs being employed.I will now address the concerns expressed by Deputies about the review process itself and reassure the House on this issue.  I emphasise that every school was requested to inform parents that the review was commencing and to invite them to contribute, should they wish, either by telephone contact or by appointment during the review.  Many parents participated in the process.  In deciding the level of SNA support to be allocated to the school, the SENO visited each school and examined the professional reports for each child with special educational needs.  The review process also allowed SENOs the opportunity to discuss with the principal, teachers and SNA the manner in which the care needs of the child arose in the school and to look at the school records and so forth.  The SENO observed the student in the classroom and the schoolyard.  To fully review the needs of all pupils enrolled in special schools, the council arranged for a team of two to three SENOs to visit each school.I am aware, from the council, that some schools were concerned that the decision was only taken on the basis of the observations of the SENO in the classroom.  The House will appreciate, from the process I have outlined, that the SENO considered the professional reports, discussions with staff and any school records, as well as direct observation before determining the appropriate level of support.Since January 2005, the council has been committed to exercising its role in the allocation of additional teaching hours and SNAs to schools to support the education of children with special educational needs in a way that is fair, consistent and transparent.  In carrying out this function, the council applied my Department's policy and has sought to obtain all relevant evidence in regard to a child's educational and care needs.Each year, approximately 4,000 primary, post-primary and special schools submit in the region of 12,000 applications for teaching and SNA supports to their local SENO.  Given the scale of the operation, it is inevitable that some schools or parents may seek to query the outcome of the decision-making process in regard to a child or a particular group of children.  In certain cases, the school or parents may be in a position to provide additional information, such as new professional reports, which come to hand when the original decision has been made.  The council will take the necessary steps to review the original decision in such cases and will alter the level of resources to be allocated to the school, if considered appropriate.However, the council has recognised that situations will arise where no new information is available but the school or parent is not satisfied with the outcome.  To address such cases, the council has recently introduced an appeals procedure whereby schools and parents may appeal a decision in regard to the allocation of teaching and SNA resources.  Where that is lodged by the school, they will be permitted to retain the resources under appeal, pending the outcome of the appeals process.

In doing so, the senior SENO will uphold or alter the decision.This appeals process has only just been introduced and is available to schools.  I am aware that a number of schools have already submitted appeals in regard to the outcome of the review of SNA resources and these appeals will be processed following the Easter holidays.  However, this process will lead to a greater level of clarity and more transparency around the allocation of teaching and SNA resources to schools for the 2010-11 academic year.The council is now also in the process of establishing an independent advisory committee to process submissions from schools where, on receipt of an appeal, a board of management considers that the operation of the appeals process itself was deficient.  This committee will comprise an independent chair, a representative of school management bodies and a parent.  It is my understanding that this will meet in the autumn to review the operation of the appeals process following completion of applications for the next academic year.  The committee will then submit a report to the council.

I would encourage use of the new appeals procedure by parents who are dissatisfied with the outcome of the review of their child's case.  I note also that the original motion calls for a review of the SNA's role in light of schools' experience of the post and also calls for the SERC criteria for the allocation of SNAs to be reviewed.As the House is aware, a separate value for money and policy analysis review is at an advanced stage in my Department at present.  As part of this process, schools, parents, teachers, professionals and children have been consulted.  Almost 100 schools have been visited by the inspectorate, NEPS and the council to establish the duties currently undertaken by SNAs.  I expect to have this review completed in 2010 and the report will be published.I support special schools and special classes, and they will continue to have a significant role in the education of pupils with special needs.  I am anxious to examine ways in which special schools can act in a co-operative way with mainstream primary and post-primary schools to provide enhanced services to pupils with special educational needs and their parents.In just over ten years, the Government has driven a complete transformation in educational policy for children with special educational needs.  Whereas, ten years ago, most parents of children with significant special education or care needs had no choice but to send them to a special school, they now have three distinct choices available to them: the child can attend a mainstream class in the local school with additional supports as required; attend a special class in a mainstream school; or attend a special school.  The needs of students can change as they get older and mature.  The system now in place provides a continuum of education and options to enable students to move from one setting to another in line with their changing needs.I am proud of the Government's achievements in providing for the education of children with special educational needs.  I will continue to prioritise investment and ensure that additional teaching and care supports are provided.  I will continue to expand the educational psychological service so that every school has a direct service from NEPS.  I will continue to work with the council to ensure that services for children with special needs are provided in a co-ordinated and effective manner.  I will continue to provide for expert support, professional development and training.The SNA scheme has not changed.  This is the scheme that has driven an increase in SNAs from 1,500 in 2000 to 10,000 today.  The criteria that qualified children for SNA support in the past ten years continue to apply, and nothing has changed.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I welcome the opportunity to contribute in support of the counter-motion.  All Members of the House will acknowledge that many significant advances have been made in recent years, improving the lives of children with special needs and the lives of their families.  There have been significant developments in special education since 1998 involving enhanced levels of provision, as well as new structural and legislative frameworks for the delivery of services to pupils with special educational needs.  I emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs.While the Opposition may be critical of the decision to pause the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act at this point, the Government has re-stated its support for this process through its commitment in the renewed programme for Government.  I make it clear, however, that the Government's commitment to special needs education provision is not constrained within the provisions of that Act.  Services continue to be provided to children on a non-statutory basis.  Therefore, although a number of provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act remain to be formally commenced, appropriate education services are provided as a central element in the Government's commitment to supporting children with special educational needs.This support is provided across a wide spectrum of initiatives within the education sector.  At school level, in addition to the teachers provided in the classroom, significant additional supports are also provided to enable schools to cater for the needs of students with special educational needs.  Such supports include resource teaching support, special needs assistant support, special transport arrangements, enhanced capitation and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.In recognition of the importance of co-ordinating disability services across departmental and agency lines, the Government established the Office of the Minister for Disability and Mental Health, headed up by the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney.  A cross-sectoral group has been established representative of senior officials in the education and health sectors to deal with cross-cutting issues.  This co-ordinated working will ensure delivery of the most effective response for children living with disability and special educational needs on a daily basis.  I welcome this initiative.I know parents of children with special education needs welcome the availability of education placement options and that they appreciate the supports now available to support a placement in a mainstream class where this is in line with the child's ability.  Their child can also either attend a special class or a special school if this is more appropriate to their needs.  This has been made possible by a massive increase in investment, with €1 billion being provided for special education this year, and by a huge expansion in the number of staff working solely with children with special needs, with more than 20,000 adults whose sole role is to support children with special educational needs.Further improvements have also taken place.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I only have two minutes left and there are important points I wish to make.  For example, in the past year, more than 23,000 teacher training places in special education have been provided by the Special Education Support Service, a service established to provide expert support, professional development and training opportunities in special education for school staff.  Some 100 teaching posts have also been provided at post-primary level to augment learning support services in post-primary schools.The renewed programme for Government commits to the expansion in the number of psychologists in the National Educational Psychological Service to 210.  This will facilitate the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to all primary and post-primary schools.  The number of psychologists has already grown from 127 at the start of the current Government term to 157 psychologists currently in the service.  Pending the roll-out of a full NEPS service, schools have access to psychological assessments through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments administered by NEPS.  The Opposition has raised the decision to close a number of special classes last year.  I ask the House to recognise the factual position of special classes.  This decision did not represent a change in policy but reflects the fact that teacher posts are allocated in line with pupil numbers.  The pupil numbers in these classes were insufficient to retain the classes.  I can understand the disappointment of some schools that this is the position.  However, it must be understood that the majority of the schools accepted this position.  Schools are also aware that every mainstream primary school has been allocated additional teaching support through the general allocation model to meet the needs of any pupil with special educational needs, including mild general learning disability.  Some schools which appealed the decision to close the classes and which have provided substantial reasons to either retain the class or have the class redesignated, received a fair hearing.  On appeal, 11 of the classes were retained and a further three classes were also redesignated to cater for pupils with other disabilities.  The schools concerned had enrolled pupils with disabilities other than mild general learning disability in the classes.I assure the House that the Government is very aware of the difficulties families of children with disabilities face.  Its only objective is to support these families and the schools their children attend.  I commend the amendment to the House.

We have all been lobbied by teachers but when the parents come and when it is about the child, that is when we should sit up and take notice.  I commend Deputy Brian Hayes for tabling this motion which is well-intentioned and timely.The most disappointing element of this year's budget was the 21% cut in funding for the National Council for Special Education Needs.  This was the clearest indication of the intent of the Department of Education and Science with regard to children with educational special needs.  The former Minister for Education and Science, closed 128 special classes in 2009.  I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey.  Is he seriously saying there is no longer a need for special classes to the extent that 128 can be closed down?  Some of those classes were retained under review and on appeal.Our attitude towards children with special needs and their prospects, have changed beyond recognition.  I accept that significant strides have been made in the education of children with special needs.  The days of them sitting at the back of the class playing with plasticine are over and gone and they should stay gone.A small group of adults with special needs recently graduated from Trinity College.  Such achievements are few and far between but they achieved third level education and this is what should be possible for all children with special needs.  Tonight's debate is about children who are still in primary school.  The debate about second level education has to take place another time.  Those in primary school desperately need assistance.  The Minister makes a very clear distinction between teaching assistants and SNAs but we all know that SNAs perform a range of functions.  They know the child, they are wedded to the child for whom they care and the child knows them.  If special schools and special classes are being closed down, then the only other place for these children is within mainstream classrooms.  It is not just a case of children with an intellectual disability.  There are children who need additional help to achieve their best potential, so that they can come out of primary school, go on to secondary school and with the right type of supports, go on to third level.  We must ensure that children who in the past were ignored are allowed fulfil their potential, play an active role in society and have a good, healthy life.The Minister informed us that all of these schools were individually reviewed as were all the children.  She said the senior special education needs organisers decided on the cutback in numbers but they worked in conjunction with the school, the teacher, the child, the parent and the SNA.  That is not true.  That did not happen.I will tell the House about one little boy whose name is Jack.  He is a typical child with special educational needs.  There are a thousand such children around the country.  Jack's disability is that he does not speak.  His SNA learned sign language and adapted it to Jack's needs.  She used sign language to ask him if he needed to use the toilet or if he wished to eat his lunch.  She gave him a new lease of life through this communication.  She learned sign language in her own time and she adapted it to his needs because he has a very specific disability.  The principal of that school told me that Jack reached par with his classmates within months and his whole life brightened.  However, his SNA was last into the school so she was first out.  I do not believe the senior special education needs organisers went to the schools and asked what were the specific needs of the children.  They did not do that.  They went in and said that if the school had five SNAs they only needed four.  Unfortunately, the four that remain do not have sign language and Jack does not know them.  This is typical of what is happening all over the country.

I compliment him on bringing this motion before the House.  I also speak in support of the contribution which my colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, our spokesperson on equality, has made on this issue over a period of time.Listening to the Minister and the Minister of State, one would think there was no problem at all and that no cutbacks were taking place, that somehow, the concerns that are being communicated to us on a daily basis by parents, teachers and SNAs, were made up. They are not.  Over the past week or more, my colleagues and I have received many heart-rending stories from parents about what is likely to happen to their child in circumstances where the SNA is removed.  These are very real stories that are not made up.  The Government needs to respond positively to them this evening rather than in the self-congratulatory way of its response.It is somewhat ironic that this measure is being introduced to save money, apparently, something in the order of €27 million.  This on a day when thousands of millions of euro of taxpayers' money is being provided to support the banks.  The €27 million that it is proposed to save on the pay bill of SNAs, as it happens, is the same as the €27 million required to provide a pension for just one executive in one of the covered banks.  I have received representations from parents and staff of Enable Ireland in Sandymount, which is only one of the many examples that have been brought to our attention.  This special needs school will lose three teachers and five SNAs.  Many of its students require assistance with feeding and the other tasks necessary for them to stay in school.The logic that these cuts will somehow save money beats me because SNAs are relatively low paid.  One SNA informed me that he was paid €442 per week.  If he loses his job and returns to social welfare, he will get €382 per week not counting any secondary benefits for which he might qualify.  These cuts are a false economy which will save, at most, €50 or €60 per post.  This must be weighed against the loss to the schools, children and families concerned.  The proposal needs to be reconsidered by the new Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  She set out for the House what appears to be her Department's official line but she needs to think these proposals through.  Before the vote is taken this evening, I hope she has second thoughts but, even if she does not, she should give serious consideration to what has been said this evening and respond positively to the needs of parents, teachers and, most of all, the children who rely on SNAs.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for the opportunity to speak on this issue, which I previously raised on the Adjournment debate last Thursday.  The response on that occasion came in the form of a Civil Service script which did not refer to the central issue in my submission and was read by a Minister of State who had no connection with the Department of Education and Science or the civil servant who wrote the script.  The script might as well have been e-mailed to me for all the heed paid to my comments.  I hoped the Minister would have stayed in the Chamber on this, my second attempt to bring this issue to her attention but perhaps her officials will ensure she is made aware of my concerns.  This is a vital issue for our most special and deserving of young citizens and the Minister's decision will determine the quality of the rest of their lives.Great progress has been made in making provision for the education of special needs children generally.  While parents continue to fight step-by-step for services, the objective of Government policy is that each special needs child can develop to the maximum of his or her potential.  The decision of the Government and the former Minister for Education and Science to remove 1,200 special needs assistants from the educational system will be an unmitigated disaster for these special citizens.  The progress they have made will soon be reversed in the absence of SNAs.In the specific case of St. Raphael's special needs school in Celbridge, it is proposed to withdraw 4.5 SNA posts.  All of the 47 pupils at this school have been assessed as being in the category of severe to profound disability.  They are taught in classes of six students with one SNA to every two pupils.  I have also been contacted by a Labour Party councillor in Castlebar, Mr. Harry Barrett, who has given me details on the situation in St. Anthony's special needs school, which is attended by 40 pupils aged between six and 18 years and currently employs 13 SNAs.  It is proposed to remove four, or 33%, of the SNA posts from each of these special schools.  This decision is not based on the needs of the children, it is part of a culling process to reach the target of disposing of 1,200 SNA posts.  In both of these special schools, two SNAs are required to attend a child who needs to use the bathroom or becomes disturbed, leaving only one SNA to assist the remaining five children in the class.  That will no longer be possible if some are removed, with severe consequences for the educational development and physical safety of the children concerned.I appeal to the new Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan, whom I know to have a sympathetic understanding of children with special needs, to review the decision on SNAs and, in particular, to grant the appeal lodged to the special educational needs organiser in the case of St. Raphael's in Celbridge and St. Anthony's in Castlebar.  Earlier this week, I presented to the Minister a collection of petitions on behalf of St. Raphael's in which parents set out in heartfelt detail how their special children would be affected.  All have expressed fear for the future of their children and anger that the cull of special needs assistant posts was even contemplated.  I ask that she read the petitions before she makes any final decision.I recognise that the Government is strapped for cash but surely savings could be found elsewhere than from the most needy and deserving children.  I rely on the Minister's humanity to correct this unacceptable decision.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I thank the Fine Gael education spokesperson, Deputy Brian Hayes, for putting this very important matter on the agenda.  I wish the new Minister for Education and Skills well in her new portfolio but I am gravely disappointed that she has not stayed in the House for this debate.  Many people have taken time off to follow this debate from the Visitors' Gallery and it does not augur well if she cannot make herself available for three hours tonight.Expectation is relevant to this debate.  Every parent expects that a mainstream education is achievable for their loved ones.  That expectation arose when the position of SNA's came on stream.  The work that parents and, in many cases, grandparents, uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters and neighbours have done over the years is now being supplemented in the classroom by the SNAs.  The confidence this gave to parents was unbelievable and the bond created between the family and the SNA is of paramount importance if successful integration is to take place.The pride that parents take from their children's performance is something that has to be seen to be believed.  In some instances that progress would not be known to anyone but the immediate family but in others the integration process was such a success that the child developed to the point where an SNA was no longer needed.  The common denominator is that the child, his or her family and the SNA worked together to ensure success.  We should not forget the efforts of the teachers and boards of management.I received a letter from a parent in my constituency which states:Since my last communication with you via this forum a few changes have occurred.  My eldest son's access to a SNA has been reduced and my youngest son is in danger of losing out on a much coveted place in one of our local primary schools because of the scramble for places for children with an intellectual disability.What hasn't changed however is their diagnoses.  One remains autistic with ADHD and the other with Global Developmental Delay and a moderate learning disability.Having become accustomed to the "fight" over the past number of years i.e. access to speech and language services, occupational therapy, etc. I really feel at a loss as to why I and many other parents like me, must summon all our strength and resources to ensure our children be provided with an education that is entirely appropriate to their needs.I, for one, am tired of the "fight" and look forward to a time when the savagery of the education cutbacks will no longer affect our precious children.I realise this last paragraph is a statement that reflects the thoughts of many thousands of parents throughout the country tonight.  Yet, I also know the expectation of all those parents is such that they will not give up the fight and will continue the battle, which is what this is seen as, to ensure their children will be given the opportunity of education, which should be freely given with goodwill by the Government.  The SNA, special needs assistant, mechanism is good.  It works and gets results.  Why change a winning team?  In many instances, the team includes teachers and SNAs.  Most important is that the children deserve the service.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	503	Throughout the State, schools, teachers and parents are unsure whether their children with special educational needs will have access to special needs assistants in the morning.  A review has been ongoing and has already cut somewhere in the region of 200 to 300 special needs assistants, but the cuts figure could reach 1,200.  We do not know the exact figure of how many have already been cut, because the Minister and representatives of the National Council for Special Education have been unable or unwilling to give us the figure.As public representatives we have all had constituents coming to us concerned for the future education of their son or daughter with a special need.  It should not be necessary for any parent to have to come to a public representative to make a desperate plea for assistance.  This unfair and crude review by the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Science of special needs assistants in mainstream and special schools will have a vast negative impact on vulnerable children.  Special needs assistants are recruited specifically to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities in an educational context.  The SNA plays an indispensable role in meeting such needs by assisting with toileting, feeding, personal hygiene, mobility, medical procedures, communication and in supporting behaviour modification such that the child can access and benefit from the primary school curriculum.There is a concern that reductions in the numbers of SNAs in schools will cause increased and unmanageable levels of behaviour in classrooms resulting in disruptions to teaching and learning for all involved.  If a child does not receive an appropriate education taking account of his or her individual strengths or needs, he or she may be marginalised within the school community and in society in general.  There are implications for the mental health of children whose individual needs are not met and whose individual strengths are not developed.  Their opportunities for success are not experienced and their anxiety is not managed.Studies show that children with a learning disability are at a higher risk of mental health difficulties than children who do not have a disability.  The reduction in the level of SNAs in our schools will remove the child from the hub of the teaching and learning process and dilutes the philosophy of our primary education system, which enshrines and espouses a child-centred curriculum for all pupils including those with special needs.  I believe the legal entitlement for pupils with special educational needs to have the same right to avail of and benefit from appropriate education will be denied if there are reductions in the numbers of SNAs.  An appropriate education is one which reflects individual strengths and needs and sets long-term goals and short-term objectives.  It results from a collaboration among parents, school staff, other professionals and the child.  An appropriate education recognises that if basic needs are not met, the child will not meet his or her potential.Reductions in SNA numbers and the manner in which it has been undertaken will, I believe, make the legal entitlement of pupils to leave school with skills necessary to participate to the level of their capacity and in an inclusive way in the social and economic activities of society unattainable.  Pupils' care needs will not be met and therefore personal growth and fulfilment will not be achieved.  Levels of challenging behaviour will escalate resulting in increased injury to pupils and staff and pupils will be at increased risk of developing mental health difficulties.  At the crux of this is the fact that children's lives are being disrupted.  The damage done now will have a vast impact in the years to come.The Minister of State and the Minister in absentia should note that serious questions need to be answered with regard to this issue.  How many special needs assistant posts have already been lost in the past year?  Will the Minister of State give us that information before the conclusion of the debate?  How many more does the Minister of State anticipate or plan will be lost?  Will schools which have lost an SNA or a special class be provided with additional special needs supports?  What additional resources will be provided to schools which have lost special needs supports?  These are questions that need to be answered.  The pupils most affected by such cuts as well as their parents, teachers and school communities deserve no less than this information and what we actually require is the restoration of the posts already taken and a review of the additional supports that most assuredly must be invested in our education system.The outdated review criteria and the absence of an independent appeals process speaks volumes of the motives behind this review.  I speak of an independent appeals process.  How is it fair that a child loses his or her SNA?  Until recently, there was no way of appealing this decision.  It is the case that there are opportunities to appeal now but only to the NCSE, National Council for Special Education.  This is in no way independent and is patently unfair.These cuts simply cannot be justified, especially given the context of large class sizes, some as high as 30 pupils to one teacher.  Cuts have already been implemented such as that to the resource grant and home-school liaison teachers.  A child with a special need in a mainstream class without adequate support would surely get lost in the system as many have done throughout the decades when no supports were in place.  It is unacceptable to deny a child the chance of a proper education and a proper chance in life for the sake of a few million euro.  Let there be no mistake about it, that sum of money could be found elsewhere as Deputies on the Opposition benches have outlined time after time.  I have it to say that for a few million euro what is actually being done and visited on young people and their families in terms of the present and their futures is truly disgraceful.  This is taking place in the context of the further robbery of the taxpayer this week as we witnessed here from what was outlined yesterday to prop up a zombie bank.  It is nothing short of obscene.The Tánaiste and recently appointed Minister for Education and Science must now start looking at the provision of special needs assistants as more than a financial matter.  These are real children not numbers.  They are vulnerable children at that and do not deserve to be shoved from pillar to post as part of an accounting exercise.  Cuts to special needs support is not only heartless, but the move will seriously impair these children's education for years to come and will have serious knock-on effects in the future.  It is yet another example of this Government's short-sighted cost-cutting measures.  Special needs assistants are not a luxury that can be cut.  They are essential and, I emphasise, an integral part of the education system.Let us remind ourselves for a moment of the week in which this debate is taking place.  The Minister's party calls itself a republican party.  The proclamation of the Irish Republic in 1916, that we remember this week in particular, pledged to "cherish all the children of the nation equally".  A child with special needs has a right to a decent education and a decent start in life as much as any other child and it is a bounden responsibility on Government to ensure that is delivered.I appeal to the new Minister for Education and Science, who is the Tánaiste, and to the Government collectively not to proceed with further cuts to special needs support and to reinstate support that has already been removed.  That commitment is the least we expect from this debate and, as I have already stated, there is a need then for a review not in terms of what cuts can be applied, but of what additional supports and resources can be provided to ensure that every child gets an equal start in life.

I wish to share time with my colleagues, Deputies Paul Gogarty, Charlie O'Connor and Margaret Conlon.I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  My job as a Government Deputy is to influence Government policy and to try to effect change to that policy where I believe change is required.As Deputies will be aware, I represent Mayo and St. Anthony's special school in Castlebar has been very much central to this debate, both nationally and locally.  There are two areas on which I want to focus in particular.  I ask that the new Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Coughlan, focus on these two issues and effect change to the policy as it currently stands.  I believe it is change that can happen without any great difficulty and I ask that she consider these matters carefully.SENOs carry out reviews every year in special schools — they carried one out in St. Anthony's in September last.  They carry out that review based on the criteria set out, and those criteria have not changed.  It is exactly the same criteria that is being used in the national review being carried out at present.  As a public representative, I find it hard to understand how, within a period of four months in which the same criteria were being used, such a change could have resulted in two SNAs losing their jobs.My big problem with this particular issue, which I have articulated at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science, is that for a school to plan and organise its activities, and for parents, teachers and the children themselves to be able to have any sort of order in their lives, they need to know that when a SENO carries out a review, it is good for 12 months.  That is not an unreasonable expectation.  It is unacceptable to me that SNAs would be withdrawn from schools mid-year.Towards the end of February an appeal process was introduced into the system.  I will speak briefly about that shortly because the second change I want relates to it.  We are now in a position where approximately 100 schools have asked to be allowed enter the appeal process.  They must give five working days' notice to signal that they want an appeal in the first place.  Then the SENO must give them their result in writing and they have ten working days to get the appeal forms out to them so that the school can act in that regard.  After that, it takes 20 working days for another SENO within the NCSE to go over the appeal concerned.There is a reason I am going through all of this — I am sorry to labour the point.  However, it is Easter and given that many of these schools are in the appeals process and there are these periods of five, ten and 20 working days, if they get a successful decision at that stage, it would be fantastic.  If, however, they do not, they must give four weeks' notice to their SNAs in any event for them to vacate their jobs by which time we will be at the summer period.I am asking — it is not an unreasonable request at this stage in the game — that the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Science take this on board and adopt a reasonable approach.  Schools are now notifying the NCSE as to who is leaving and what the enrolments will be by May of this year.  It would be possible to carry out the next review in the summer for the next year, and in September schools can start the school year with the correct allocation.  This is a timing issue.  It would give much comfort to schools at this stage if they were told that the SNAs will be left there, this is the situation that will apply until the summer and we will look at the matter again at the start of the school year in the autumn.Although there is much to say in the debate, the second point I want to make in the short time available relates to the appeal mechanism.  I would find fault with the fact that the appeal mechanism was only introduced in February.  I am lucky enough in that St. Anthony's special school is able to get into the appeal process, but there are many other schools.  I speak for all special schools and, indeed, any school around the country which had its SNA withdrawn before the appeal process was in place——

I feel just as angry and aggrieved as Members on that side of the House.  Children with special needs in County Mayo are just as important as those anywhere else throughout the country and I feel equally strongly about it.To be honest, I do not have any great difficulty with the review of SNAs.  However, I would like to think that a genuine independent appeal mechanism outside of the NCSE would be available to people, particularly in the case of the last resort, as one would call it, which is the independent examination of the appeal process.  I am not happy with that at all because it only deals with the process of the appeal as opposed to the in-depth detail of what constituted the issue in the first place.The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, can start off her time in education in a constructive way by looking at these two issues and effecting change, which will not mean any great difference in terms of resources but which will mean a great deal to children with special needs.

As an experienced parliamentarian — she is over 20 years in this House — she can make her mark in this area.  Tonight's debate is the first opportunity she could have, and I would urge her to take it.Although issues of banking and recapitalisation and the costs to services have been outlined, this discussion has nothing to do with the money that needs to be borrowed to support the banking system.  Much as I am on the record as saying that it makes my skin crawl, and others' skin crawl, sadly, it is necessary in order to minimise the burden placed on the taxpayer and future generations.  Otherwise, there would be no money available because the interest we would be paying on our overdraft would be so much that it would affect wages, services and also social supports.  This has been discussed in great detail, for example, last night.  There is not a pot of money that can be taken from NAMA and banking recapitalisation and spent on other areas.  It is money being provided specifically by the European Central Bank to rebuild the banking system and, hopefully, although there is a risk involved, make money for the State that we can spend on the services that are needed.  However, that is another debate.I welcome this Private Members' session.  In particular, I welcome the mature, balanced and co-operative approach that has been taken.  There has not been any mud slinging or point scoring.  I acknowledge the genuine sincerity of Deputy Brian Hayes and his colleagues, and the motivation behind this motion.As the House will be aware, there is a Government amendment to which the Whip system applies, and the Government amendment will be taken first.  That said, this debate is not three hours of wasted time.  It is three hours of very valuable time that should not be forgotten by the Minister at a quarter to nine.The points that have been raised already, and that will be raised in the summation, and the lessons learned should be taken on board, certainly in terms of how the current review is being rolled out.  Maybe there are opportunities to go further than that.  The National Council for Special Education may be autonomous in its day-to-day operation, but the Minister and her Department have the power to shape policy and its implementation.This discussion follows on from a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science.  As Chairman of the committee, I facilitated the meeting but I must acknowledge the major role played by Deputies Brian Hayes and Flynn in organising it.  The committee meeting looked at a range of issues involving special education, specifically the special needs assistant, SNA, review in both special and mainstream schools with contributions from the principals of several schools, the trade union IMPACT and a delegation from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.The NCSE did not cover itself in glory that day and praise is due to Oireachtas Members of all parties whose questioning highlighted the glaring deficits in how the SNA review is being carried out.  As a Member of a Government party, I do not have difficulties with a review that aims to ensure SNA support is allocated in areas where it is most needed and where it is not being used inappropriately.A commitment was given to the Green Party under the renewed programme for Government that the roll-out of the Education for Special Educational Needs Act 2004, EPSEN, would continue starting with more investment for additional psychologists at the National Educational Psychological Service and that any money saved from possible job cuts in SNA numbers would be ring-fenced for special needs.I was gratified to hear from the NCSE and from the Minister tonight that the remit is not to save money but instead to focus on allocation of support and that areas where support is no longer needed or not being provided appropriately would be reallocated.  However, while I fully agree with the policy, I cannot say the same for its implementation.  As other Members have pointed out, no appeals process was in place from the beginning of the review.  The NCSE representatives could not give a rational excuse as to why they started culling mid-stream except for a vague allusion to Government policy.  The Minister did not say there was a diktat from her, or her predecessor, to the NCSE.The Minister, however, did say she could allow a longer transitional time and ask the NCSE to examine that.  I hope that means action on the ground.  As Deputy Flynn stated, those children who were to have had their SNAs withdrawn will get them back for the remainder of the school year.There are disagreements as to the criteria used in allocating a SNA to a child.  Taking away a SNA from a child, however, is callous, cruel and inhumane for the child who has built up a relationship with his or her SNA, a relationship of trust, confidence and dependence.  It cannot just be broken midway through a school year.  Although the SNAs may not be allocated the same time each year like mainstream teachers, to withdraw them in that manner does not make sense.  It is better to wait for the few weeks of the summer break.  The Minister has been advised posts are not allocated at the same time each year.  She has the power to resolve this matter and I hope she carries this through.That is, of course, if the removal was warranted in the first place.  I was disappointed to learn from my discussions with parents and principals that there was no appeals process at the outset.  Special educational needs organiser decisions from February are now to be internally reviewed but there will still be no independent review due until 2011 at earliest.  The Minister stated an independent advisory committee will be established in the autumn.  I hope this proves to be a powerful committee rather than just another quango and will allow schools make appeals, including those who did not get the opportunity in the first place.  I see Deputy Stanton shaking his head in disagreement but I hope it is more than a sop and will influence the process.The principal of St. Joseph's school, Tallaght told the joint education committee:From the outset the SENOs seemed determined to achieve large staff reductions irrespective of arguments put by school staff, me or the board of management.  They failed to seek the opinions of parents, staff, the principal or the board of management.  They requested documents from outside professionals only, including psychological reports, occupational therapy reports and reports from consultant doctors but no signed reports from the teachers or the principal.  The review lacked openness, transparency and proper consultation.The NCSE said the 1993 special education review committee, SERC, criteria are a baseline level and that the service it provides is above and beyond this.  While I may not be fully qualified to comment on this, I must point out the SERC criteria are from 1993, published prior to health and safety legislation, child protection measures and the EPSEN Act, and need to be updated.The review process is a waste of money.  If posts are being reallocated, then sacking a SNA immediately rather than leaving them on a panel in a specified geographic area does not make sense.  One principal from a special needs school informed me in an e-mail that it may acquire up to ten SNAs through the new process but will still have to get rid of eight.  He described it as, "What a Carry On".  What is the point in getting rid of jobs when creating more?  The process needs to be examined.In November 2008, IMPACT made a submission regarding the value for money and policy review of the SNA scheme.  It made suggestions for the more efficient use of resources and spoke of the need for clarification of the role of SNAs, professional qualifications and the basis of employment which would best facilitate any redeployment of staff as required.  I welcome the agreement by the NCSE to discuss these suggestions with IMPACT.  I hope the council and the Department of Education and Science will learn from them.The Minister's wording of the amendment to the motion has done an excellent job in defending the Government's commitment to special needs.  She has clarified SNA resources will not be cut but instead reallocated.  More importantly, her contribution reflected some small movement forward from the Department's position at the time of the education committee meeting.  I hope this is not just empty talk but will lead to a tangible improvement in services on the ground.  I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for tabling this motion.

As Deputy Gogarty and others have said, there has been a high level of co-operation in constituencies on the special educational needs issue.  I, along with the other Members from Dublin South-West, Deputies Rabbitte and Brian Hayes, have signed correspondence together pointing out our concerns about this issue to the Minister.  Regardless of our political differences, it is important we work together on this matter, something which the community would want too.I have known St. Joseph's school in Tallaght for many years.  Many of its ex-pupils come to me for many reasons.  It is important we show our support for it.  I have attended the public meetings and the education committee meeting with NCSE.  I met today with many of the parents and children affected outside of the House.  I did not go out to get my picture taken but, as other colleagues did, to meet the people there.  It is important we do that and listen to them.  I compliment our colleagues, particularly Deputy Flynn, on the education committee under Deputy Gogarty's chairmanship which did a great job on this matter.  They did not spare anyone and got the job done on that day.  It is a great shame they did not get the answers they deserved.  Deputies from Dublin South-West met the chief executive officer and principal officer of the NCSE the previous day.  I hope this does not affect the issue but I was not very impressed by their failure to answer questions.  I consistently made the point, including during a long conversation with the Minister on Monday, that I cannot understand how this can happen in a school situation.  I discussed this point with Deputy Finian McGrath, whom I regard as an education expert and who is a former school principal.

In a "normal" school, if I can use that word and I apologise if it offends anyone, changing staff levels causes disruption.  Doing so in our special schools is nonsense.  I have consistently said to the former Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and I now appeal to the Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, that this process must be stalled and reviewed.

As the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Science stated, that is absolute nonsense.  I do not understand it.  I ask the Minister in her first days in the Department to examine the challenge this issue presents.Other colleagues have referred to the high level of co-operation across the floor.  Private Members' business is sometimes difficult and with my hand on my heart I can tell Deputies that tonight's debate is difficult for me.  The Government benches is a lonely place for such a debate in respect of the decisions we must take.I hope the Minister will listen to the genuine concerns expressed.  Let us not play politics; let us try to get the message across.  I said I have a concern about all the schools but I have a particular focus on St. Joseph's Special School in Balrothery, which caters for pupils aged four to 18 with a mild general learning disability.  I am told the pupil teacher ratio is 11:1.  The school has 89 pupils and its staff includes an administrative principal.  Without being patronising, I do not know if Mr. Brendan Hennigan is still in the Visitors Gallery but I wish to pay tribute to him.  He has dealt with the public representatives in Dublin South-West in a very fair way.  All Deputies have been to the meetings, as has the local mayor, Councillor Mick Duff, and other colleagues and Mr. Hennigan has acted in a fair way.  He knows this is a difficult issue for me and I appreciate the correspondence and advice from him.  The protest outside the Department of Education and Science was very demanding for him and I am glad we were able to help.  There are 15 teachers in the school, including four teachers who provide special subject hours and 17 SNAs.As part of the review of SNA posts in schools, the NCSE reviewed staffing levels and the level of care needs in the school.  It advised the school four SNA posts should be suppressed with effect from 19 February.  The principal, Mr. Hennigan, tells me that, following a review, the NCSE requested that SNAs should be reduced from 17 to 13 by 2 April.  The board of management decided at its meeting on Thursday that it had no choice but to issue notice of termination to eight special needs assistants.  They have been advised since to defer four of those terminations pending the outcome of the recent review.  I support the principal, who makes the point that it is no way to run a school to take on staff and then make changes to the situation.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this in a special way.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I wish the Minister for Education and Science all the best in her new role and I thank Deputy Hayes for bringing this motion before the House.  I know Deputy Hayes from my time on the Joint Committee on Education and Science.  He is genuinely committed to education matters.  The education of children with special needs has been and remains a priority for the Government.  The Government has put major resources into schools to enable them to meet the needs of these children.  This amounts to €1 billion alone this year.  In the past ten years we have witnessed major changes.  The SNA scheme has been a key factor in ensuring the successful integration of children with special needs into mainstream education and providing support to the pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.  I am delighted to hear the Minister say that children with special educational needs who require support will continue to have it.  It is extremely important we afford those children the opportunity to be the best they can possibly be.All sides of the House have spoken about the review.  The findings of the review are counter to the common public perception that the SNA scheme has been changed or altered in some way.  It reiterates that the criteria for the allocation of SNAs remains the same.  The Department of Education and Science is committed to the SNA scheme in its present form and the review was simply an exercise to ensure the resources available under the scheme are allocated to the schools that require such assistance in a cost-effective and efficient manner.There are more than 10,000 SNAs in our schools, carrying out very valuable work dedicated to helping children achieve their potential.  The scheme costs in the region of €300 million annually.  Such a review process is imperative in the present climate of constrained resources.  In every scheme it is important to have a review, to examine how services are delivered and how money is spent in order to see if we can do things in a better way.  As well as SNAs, we have more than 8,600 resource and learning support teachers.  More than 20,000 adults are in schools with the sole role of providing support to children with special educational needs.In my former occupation as a teacher, I witnessed at first hand the benefits the SNAs, resource teachers and learning support teachers brought to schoolchildren they assisted.  The SNA scheme has ensured the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education, thereby promoting inclusivity.  Is that not what we all want for all our children?  I have witnessed pupils who required support and assistance throughout their school life but also those who needed support for a time.  This may have been a short or medium period or longer.  They grew and matured into independent learners.  It is extremely important that the reduction in support as the child matures is done in a managed way so as not to disadvantage the learner.  Taking support and security away from a child completely is not the way to do this.  It does not benefit the child.Having referred to the SNA posts and their withdrawal in mid-year, it is important to say that not all SNA posts are allocated at the beginning of the school year.  New children may arrive at school with special educational needs or some children may have updated professional reports.  It is important to have a continuation of a flexible approach to allow children have support when needed and allow the posts to serve the interests of children.  Withdrawing them in the middle of the school year does not serve the children well.

It should be an independent process.  I listened to what the Minister said tonight and I hope the independent appeals committee will be truly independent.  If it is to be impartial and to deliver results, it must be so.  As previously stated, special education remains a key priority for this Government.  Despite the ongoing economic difficulties and competing demands for funds, the renewed programme for Government announced in October 2009 commits to further investment in the development of services for pupils with special educational needs, a significant achievement at a time of reduced public spending.The Government has ensured that additional supports for children with special educational needs are in place in schools throughout the country.  Our policies and level of investment have delivered more teachers, special needs assistants, specialist equipment, assistive technology for children with special needs and specially adapted schools.  So much has happened in the past ten years.  I welcome the increases in NEPS psychologists, which is hugely important.  Every primary and post-primary school in the country should have a NEPS psychologist.  The Government is committed to no further increase in pupil-teacher ratios in primary and second level schools over the lifetime of this Government and to providing 500 extra teaching posts during the next three years.The Government's investment in special needs provision speaks for itself.  It has transformed the ability of schools to provide for all children but we can do more.  Investment must continue to be made.  The Government will continue to provide support to children with special educational needs.  Those children who require support should and will get it.  We will continue to provide investment to ensure schools are in a position to welcome all students and to provide a fully inclusive education to those students.

At that time, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Green Party believed it did not go far enough.  However, the Minister at the time, Deputy Dempsey, was clear that he wanted legislation that was achievable within a particular timeframe.  EPSEN was at that time seen as a massive breakthrough for children with special educational needs.  Unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment to the children, families and schools involved.  It has not lived up to the expectations created at the time.In my view, based on my experience of meeting families with children with special educational needs, part of the problem is a lack of progress in regard to the provision of the multi-disciplinary approach, one of the fundamentals of the EPSEN Act which provides that the health and education services, schools and families come together to discuss what is needed for a particular child following which the services are provided.  However, this has never happened.  I have yet to meet a family who have had a full multi-disciplinary meeting with all of the relevant people dealing with their child.  I do not believe that is happening.The removal of special needs assistants from a number of children has added to the difficulties.  Again, I have rarely met a parent who wants his or her child to have a special needs assistant if he or she does not need one.  No parent wants their child to have a special needs assistant in the classroom unless he or she really needs one.  The quick withdrawal of SNAs has caused immense difficulty for many children.I disagree with those who have welcomed the announcement in respect of NEPS.  I continue to encounter people facing huge difficulties obtaining NEPS assessments.  I am also encountering difficulty having special education needs organisers, SENOs, recognise private assessments, for which families have often borrowed money.  I again want to reiterate the point that no independent appeals system exists.  I know of one SENO who was sent out to review the decision of another SENO, both of whom work in the same office and are the only people working in that office.  This cannot possibly be an independent system.  That is the reality of the situation.I want also to make the point that I firmly believe SENOs should have to respond to representations from public representatives.

We are often their last point of call.  The system is so bureaucratic they do not know how to get through it.  I believe SENOs should have to deal with public representatives.  I do not mind having to ask parents to sign a letter to prove I have been in touch with them.  However, if I have all the information in respect of a particular child, it is from his or her parents I am getting it.  The system needs to change.Speech and language therapy is another area where people are falling through the system.  The Minister of State will be aware that a huge number of our speech and language therapists are on maternity leave.  As a result, children are not receiving the full therapy allocated to them.  I agree with Deputy Conlon that everybody wants inclusivity.  However, children cannot get it without the supports they need.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	529	We all understand the difficulties and challenges facing families in this day and age in terms of raising and educating children and the extra challenges and difficulties experienced by families who have a child or children with special educational needs.  What a joy, relief and sense of satisfaction it must be to these parents that their child with special needs can participate in mainstream education with their brothers, sisters, neighbours, cousins and so on.  However, this is possible only through the availability of special needs assistants.  I compliment those who have taken up that vocation.  It is more than a job; it is a special skill which requires special people who are dedicated, committed and trained to carry out this work.  There are more than 400 special needs assistants in my county.  If this scheme is abolished a significant number of them will lose their positions and parents will suffer as a result.I received a letter from a parent of a child with special needs.  The child is in junior infants, has autism and is non-verbal.  Also, he has little awareness of his own safety.  For example, he is not aware of the danger of traffic on roads and needs to have an adult with him at all times to prevent him running across a busy road.  A review was carried out in February and in March the principal of the school was notified that the child's special education hours would be reduced by 50%.  This means this child will not have a special needs assistant assigned to him on the schoolyard at play times nor will he get the help he needs to eat his lunch.  The parents are extremely annoyed and believe this decision to be grossly unfair.  The letter states. "Our son's needs have not changed since he started school last September so we do not understand why or how the support of an SNA has been taken from him."  This is being replicated many times not alone in County Donegal but throughout the country.  How devastating it must be for the parents, teachers and in particular special needs assistants who want the best for children, to have this privilege withdrawn.The Minister and I have been colleagues for a long time.  We have soldiered together.  I know she understands the difficulties facing such parents and will be sympathetic to them.  I ask the Minister, as she begins her reign as Minister for Education and Skills, to carry out a complete assessment of this scheme and to restore this service to as many people as possible.  All we want for these children is the same opportunities afforded to their siblings and peers.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I congratulate Deputy Brian Hayes on his initiative in bringing this motion before the House.The current strategy in the Department of Education and Skills in removing special needs assistants throughout the educational system is, as Deputy Hayes stated, causing havoc and must be reversed at once.  This decision is simply wrong and unfair and must be reversed.  People who require special needs assistants are vulnerable.  They are people with less life opportunity than the majority of the general population.  Special needs assistants provide these people with an opportunity to achieve their potential which is limited by their difficulties.  We have seen the effects of allowing these children to reach their potential.  People with special educational needs can, without assistance, suffer social and personal difficulties in their lives.  It is unacceptable to deprive people, through the removal of this service, of the opportunity to reach that level of fulfilment in latter life.  The Department should seriously rethink its attitude in this regard.  Children with special needs were for far too long ignored by the education system.We then changed that and recognised that those with special needs can be assisted, their life opportunities can be improved, the difficulties experienced by people who have such limitations can be overcome and they have an opportunity to live a better life.  Many people with special needs who have been assisted went on to live very fulfilling, productive lives, but without the opportunity of guidance at a vital stage of their lives they would not have a chance to do that.  The two areas in which the Minister of State and I are interested, namely, mental health and well-being are influenced by our opportunities in life at an early age, from infancy to school-going age.  The input at that age is vital for life opportunities.  The Minister should seriously consider the approach she is taking in reducing the level of service to people who are extremely vulnerable.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	531	My office, like that of various other Deputies, has been inundated with calls from the distraught parents of children with special needs.  Prejudice and social stigma often affect the lives of children with special needs and their families.  The introduction of the SNA scheme has helped to break the cycle of that stigma.  Everybody has reaped benefits from the integration of special needs children into mainstream classes and it has fostered a real sense of tolerance and respect for difference.  Removing that security and emotional stability now is a retrograde step and I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who is a genuine Minister of State, to ensure this is changed and to call off the review.I cannot understand why the previous Minister has moved the goalposts in the middle of the school year.  If a child was assessed and a supporting case was put forward last September which acknowledged the required support, how can one justify removing the support a few months later?  Last month there was a backlog of cases for SNA positions and resource and support teachers in my constituency of Clare.  I am glad to say the position has now been filled.  I raised the matter on the Adjourment.However, the uncertainty continues for many families.  I am aware of several cases where SNA supports were removed from children in mainstream schools and, as a result, the parents transferred the children to a special school because they could not cope without their SNAs.  Thankfully they are now doing well in the special school.  However, the parents concerned feel the rug is about to be pulled from underneath them and, for the second time, a number of SNA positions in the school are on the verge of being axed.  The father of a special needs child attending St. Vincent's School in Lisnagry spoke to me recently and said if it happens he does not know how his child will survive.There are 261 SNAs employed in schools in Clare and, as previous speakers said, they are doing valuable work.  If these positions are axed it will affect the overall development of a special needs child, in particular during the vital early years when early intervention is essential.  The previous Minister for Education and Science claimed that there is no question of SNA posts being removed from schools where they continue to meet the scheme's criteria.  However, the kernel of the problem is the strict evaluation criteria under which the review is being conducted takes no account whatsoever of the child's needs, in terms of access to the curriculum.  Instead, it only serves to further stigmatise the child by focusing on his or her disability.The dreams and hopes of parents and their special needs children will only be realised if they are given a fair chance.  I appeal to the Government Deputies, many of whom spoke during the debate, including Deputies O'Connor, Conlon and Gogarty, to vote with their consciences.  I support the motion and call for an end to the plans to cull special educational needs assistance in schools.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	532	Like Deputy Breen, I am heartened by some of the comments made by Members of the Government parties regarding the recognition of what this motion was about, namely, freezing the review until such time as we review the role of SNAs and the criteria involved.  The Government's amendment to the motion states the criteria has not changed, but the feeling out there is that the implementation of the criteria has changed.  This is against a background where last year 100 special classes were closed which directly affected 500 pupils.  There has been an increase in mainstream class sizes, in which there has been no arrest since.  I will give the Minister, Deputy Coghlan the benefit of the doubt; she has only been in the job for a week.  The Fine Gael motion to freeze the review recognised that to allow schools to keep an SNA where the pupil had moved on was wrong and I hope she takes that correction in the spirit in which it was intended.  That is from where we are coming.Circular 07/02 states that: "Children who need additional education arising from their disability should consider applying for extra resource hours...[A] balance must be struck between allocating necessary care support and the right of the child to acquire personal independence skills."  We are splitting hairs over what care attendance is and the role of the SNA, which is why we have called for revision of the criteria and the role of the SNA.  What is education?  What is care?  Is turning a page for child who does not know he or she has to turn a page part of his or her education or care?I am a member of the board of management of St. Catherine's special national school in Wicklow.  We met the representatives from the Department who will come to conduct a whole school evaluation next month.  I made the point to them that their evaluation is based on the current class structures, which comprise six children in each class with more than two SNAs.  If the SNA review continues, in most cases it will be put back to a baseline of two SNAs per class, with every appeal having to be made on an individual basis.One mother whose child is on the autism spectrum said:To suggest a change in the education provision at this stage in his school life flies in the face of all we know about students with autism and their requirement for routine, structure and transition.  If integration with his mainstream peers is to be pursued as discussed at a previous meeting with the SENO then SNA provision is essential for this child in its planning and implementation.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I cannot understand how any human being can justify, in the middle of a school year, the withdrawal of a service which affects children with special needs.  That kind of behaviour never ceases to amaze me.  I dealt with this issue for 30 years in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s and now in 2010, fighting for the rights of children who should have automatically received a proper education in order to fulfil their special talents and give them a chance in life.  To this day we still do not have a situation whereby a parent can go with his or her child to have him or her assessed, a place found and the appropriate medical assistance given in addition to schooling, such as speech therapy.I will use my time to give an example.  In the 1980s two parents came to me about their son.  They had gone everywhere to have the child properly assessed; he was four or five at the time.  They were told their child was mentally handicapped, and to put him into a mental institution and have another baby.  The parents concerned did not accept what they were told.  Eventually, a unit in Donnybrook, through the good office of Deputy Kenny who was then a Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for special needs, became available.  The child concerned is now 33 years of age and is a qualified architectural technician.  He has battled all his life, and unfortunately he is now unemployed as a result of the state of the building industry.One can imagine how many children are now adults living in institutions today who should never have been in such places, simply because they were not given their constitutional right to proper assessment and education.  I do not give a damn who is in government; this is an issue which should be dealt with once and for all.  Parents should not have to march on the streets in every passing decade to demand rights for their children.  It is bad enough to have a child with special needs.  Let us make life simple for them.  Their parents should be given rights in order that they do not have to go to court to fight for their children's rights.  For goodness sake, the Minister should deal with the issues.  The country is not so broke that we cannot look after a limited number of children with special needs.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I commend Deputy Brian Hayes for tabling this important motion.  The review of SNAs being undertaken by the NCSE is having a huge impact in my constituency, Tipperary South.  Pupils with special needs and other pupils in their classrooms have been affected by the removal of much needed supports.  I refer, in particular, to Ballingarry national school, St. Patrick's, Ballylooby and St. John the Baptist's in Cashel in the constituency.  However, I would like to instance the craziness of this issue in Fethard, County Tipperary, where an SNA earning €225 a week was notified a few weeks ago that she was not needed anymore.  She was put on a FÁS scheme to be trained as a secretary for which she is earning €280 a week.  The country is full of redundant and unemployed secretaries but this lady was working as an SNA and costing the State much less.  That is crazy and unacceptable and this is what is wrong.As Deputy Barrett said, if the needs of those who need only a small helping hand were met, it would be of huge benefit to them when they attend secondary school.  The value of this support cannot be calculated and it is deplorable that the Government can stand over these cutbacks.  The country is not broke.  Billions of euro were found yesterday to give to the banks.  The Government has plenty of money to waste left, right and centre.  Shame on us to allow a Government to stand over a situation in a society that we are supposed to be proud of where children with special needs have to beg for basic help and education.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	536	As a mother, I am reminded on a daily basis of the challenges that face us as parents to raise our children in a loving environment where understanding, love, and caring all play a vital role in their well-being and education.  When parents hold their son our daughter for the first time, an overwhelming feeling of joy and love sends a message to this new life that they care for him or her, he or she is special and he or she is their responsibility.  Deputy Brian Hayes tabled the motion to remind us all how precious our children are, especially children with special needs.In the old days when in excess of 50 students was the norm in classrooms, many children who were unable to cope for whatever reason were left behind.  Many were told they were not paying attention and they were put in corners and even called "dunces".  In other words, they were told they were stupid.  As a result, many children were lost into the abyss, never knowing they were special, but they only needed a helping hand.  Many left school not able to read or write with some ending up in industrial schools where their childhood was lost forever.Today, thanks to the thousands of dedicated teachers across this country, life in the classroom has changed for the better.  Going to school has become an important and enjoyable part of a child's daily experience.  The classroom has become a happier place but, for the parents of the 184,818 children with special needs, the new challenge is the threatened loss of that one special person in the classroom who can give their child the additional care and attention they need to deal with and overcome their learning disabilities and receive an education like every other child.  Children with special needs need someone to take their hand on that first day in school and make them feel safe and special.  They need a helping hand to the bus, to the classroom and to the bathroom.  Children with special needs need someone to look out for their welfare, concerns and interests.That is why specially trained SNAs are invaluable.  Special needs children develop a special bond with their SNA and rely greatly on their support and care at school.  The loss of this person from their lives in unimaginable.  Children and parents alike will suffer greatly from the loss of SNAs.  This will mean that a new generation of children is likely to be lost as they fade into the background of mainstream classrooms, where their special daily needs will no longer be catered for.  Both special schools and mainstream schools will be affected by these cuts.  Normal classroom routines will be disrupted and additional pressure will be put on teachers.  Children with special needs in mainstream schools struggle even more, and without their SNA, they are at risk of being left behind.  I implore the Minister to freeze cuts to SNAs and to recognise the invaluable work they do, without which many children and their families will suffer greatly.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for tabling the motion.  A parent's world collapses when he or she is informed that his or her son or daughter has a learning disability.  Parents want to do everything they can to address, or at least mitigate, the impact of the disability.  One of the biggest decisions many families have to make, depending on the level of disability, is where a child with special needs should attend school, for example, whether the child should attend a special school, a special class in a mainstream school or attend a mainstream class.  The supports available in each setting following discussions with the school at least in part determines where the child is educated.  Fundamental to the decision taken by parents is the objective that they want to ensure their child is able to integrate and function in society and to ensure he or she has maximum independence in order that he or she has every opportunity to maximise his or her potential.An SNA is allocated to a pupil to help him or her integrate into the school environment and to meet his or her needs.  My office, no more than any other Member's office, is inundated by calls from parents throughout my constituency who outline how services have been withdrawn and the impact that is having on their children.  However, it also has an impact on the children who have been determined by the Department and the SENO to require an SNA and the supports need to remain in place.  They are also affected by the decisions that have been taken and their supports are being undermined.Due to the cutbacks, in one school an SNA is looking after both a leaving certificate student and a junior certificate student.  Two weeks ago mock certificate examinations were taken in the school but the junior certificate student could not sit hers because she was told no one was available to assist her.  She was the only child who did not sit her mock examinations the same week as everyone else.  Where is the integration in this case?  The family is being encouraged to dissuade the child from doing transition year along with her peers.  She is being denied the choice of transition year, even though her family is anxious that she does it.  She comes from a large family and all her siblings have done transition year.  The reason for this is she will turn 18 years in fifth year and no support will be provided for her in sixth year.  As a result, she is being told she cannot do transition year with her classmates with whom she has gone through three years in secondary school.  How is she being helped to integrate into society?  The experts believe this child requires support but she is being denied it because of the decisions being taken by the Department of Education and Science.  The Government could find €40 billion for Anglo Irish Bank.  Surely it can find the small amount needed to ensure that child retains her dignity and that every other child in the education setting who needs them is given the supports he or she requires.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for tabling the motion. I also thank those in the Visitors Gallery who have travelled from different parts of the country to be present.Last year the Government introduced 32 cruel education cutbacks in the budget, which included reducing by 200 the number of primary and secondary schools and axing special needs teachers and 100 special classes.  As a result, young people were forced to pay for the mistakes of this Government.  Two schools in my constituency, Dublin North-East, were particularly affected — St. Kevin's and the Donahies community school.  Surplus students were moved into those classes because the teachers were made redundant.  The classrooms, which were already full to the brim, have become unworkable for the teachers concerned.We on this side of the House do not believe the Government when it talks about its policy of inclusion.  It is withdrawing educational supports from classrooms for reasons of cost saving.  Inclusion will only work if children with special needs are supported with adequate resources rather than cutting down on special needs assistants, who are very much needed in mainstream classrooms.  The increase in class size and the withdrawal of special needs assistants is proof that the Government is not being honest and that it is making decisions for cost-saving reasons.Last September, I visited St. Helen's special needs school in Portmarnock with which Deputy Reilly would be familiar and I spoke with the children there.  They pleaded for the retention of the special class comprising seven students who need the help and extra supports they were receiving.  They are absolutely lost since they were put into a mainstream education class.  That is a shame on the Government.The Tánaiste, who is the new Minister for Education and Skills must consider the situation, freeze the current review of special needs assistants and publish the NCSE's report on the issue without further delay.Reference was made to the figure of 1,200 yesterday in that the first tranche of 1,200 developers moved into NAMA.  We also have the situation whereby 1,200 special needs assistants have been made, in effect, redundant.  As a result of that decision, many pupils have lost out on their hope for extra help and support in the future.  As Deputy Naughten said, we can come up with €40 billion to put into a dead bank but we cannot come up with a few million to ensure that these cuts do not happen.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	539	I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the debate to which I have listened intently this evening.  I recognise that the issue is one of great concern not just to Opposition Deputies, but also to Government Deputies.  It was one of the first occasions in my time in the House to hear the spokesperson who tabled the motion being praised by Government Members.  That is an indication of the concern on this side of the House.As Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills with responsibility for special education and also with responsibility in the areas of disability and mental health under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children, it is difficult to accept that we are being dishonest and that what is happening is due to the implementation of cost-saving measures.  The opposite is the case.  It causes me great concern when that message is spread.  People have come to me in my constituency on the matter.  As the Tánaiste outlined, there has been no alteration of the criteria governing the allocation of special needs assistants.  The clear impression has been created that this is a cost-saving exercise.I was taken by the point made by Deputy Enright that many of the teams are not fully staffed by professionals.  That is especially the case with speech therapists.  I do not wish to use the term "scarce resources" in the same breath as saying we are trying to save money but we are trying to spend the allocation we have to ensure we deliver the best levels of support.  I do not intend to use my few minutes to go through the categories of funding and percentages but it is important to outline that €1 billion is allocated to special education, one ninth of the overall education budget.  I reject the allegation that what we are doing is trying to supply money to save the banks.  That is far from being the case.I refer Deputies to the fact that in the renewed programme for Government the commitment to special education has been further established.  The Tánaiste referred to the major improvements in this area.  I accept that.  I urge Members to believe in our commitment to special education, and to the disability sector.  I have initiated a value for money review.  Such reviews are often considered as an attempt by Government to fill a black hole somewhere.  I have given a commitment to the disability sector in terms of the review on practices and services.  Whatever the outcome of the review, there will not be a reduction in the €1.6 billion that is spent on the sector.  Any savings that are secured will remain in the sector.I recognise the level of funding the Tánaiste specified and to which she is committed.  Her commitment was that the Government's investment in special education would continue.  The commitment by both parties in the coalition, which is in the renewed programme for Government, is open and transparent.  It refers to the expansion in the number of psychologists employed directly by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, which would ultimately allow for the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to every primary and post-primary school in the country.  Particular emphasis will be put on special needs units, classes and special schools.  Surely that is evidence of continuing commitment to special education?Children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs.  The National Council for Special Education will continue to allocate teaching and special needs assistant resources.  Rather than reading them out, it would be worthwhile for Members to go through the details of the counter motion to see the level of commitment on staffing levels to which Deputy Conlon referred.  I refer Members to the commitment of €1 billion and the continuing commitment of the Government through the renewed programme for Government that special education remains a priority.

However, we should provide additional resources rather than cutting back on the scheme.The National Council for Special Education published its report today in which it considered 2,913 schools.  There has been no change in 1,500 schools but there has been a decrease in the number of special needs assistants in 832 schools.  That is an official report from a Government agency.  I carried out a survey in my constituency in the past month to which I received a big response.  I wish to refer to the response of a principal from a school near my home.Among our 98 pupils we have a half-dozen or so who require the assistance of a SNA.We have three SNAs — two full-time and one infant-hours working here.  They are run off their feet catering for the increasing number of children with special needs: two with spina bifida, one paralysed on one side of her body and three others with serious medical and behavioural issues.A scenario has developed where the SENO allocates more children to have their care shared among the same number of SNAs.  That appears to satisfy the "child has access to an SNA" but I wonder when the system will collapse under the strain?We had a full review headed by [the] divisional inspector conducted here on March 24th 2009 and are still awaiting a report on same.The appeals system is most unfair.  The appeals advisory committee should have been set up before the reviews commenced.  It will be set up next October.  The system is not working.  I will hand over to my colleagues.  It is a pity we did not have more time.  As someone who worked with children with special needs, I had a lot to say on the matter.  What is happening is unfair and mean in the extreme.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	543	Two minutes is a very short time.  I compliment my colleague on bringing the motion before the House.  Three Ministers have spoken in the House tonight but none of them addressed the problem of the appeals mechanism that was set up under the 2004 Act.  This is wrong.  If an Act is passed in the Dáil, it should be implemented.  The Government is breaking the law by not putting in place the appeals mechanism.It is a disgrace that families from all over the country, including SNAs, parents and children, need to come here tonight to fight for their rights.  The Government should prioritise education, including special needs education.  That it is not doing so is wrong.  It is wrong that we do not look after the most vulnerable.Deputy Barrett spelt out the circumstances that obtain very clearly.  The children with special needs need support and help from the Government.  Any Government that would not give them support, money or the backing they need must be held to account.  For too long, children with special needs have waited.  In the past few years, they got some small support from the Government.  However, what does the Government do the first time there is a downturn in the economy only attack the most vulnerable.  It is wrong and the backbenchers on the Government side know it.  That is why they should side with Fine Gael and the Labour Party and tell the senior Minister and her Government colleagues that we are not taking any more.  It is wrong to have parents worried about their children's future and that a Government would not give them the support they need.The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, and the backbenchers have an opportunity to support us tonight.  Doing so will send out the right message.  If the Government can find money for the banks, it can find money for SNAs and special educational needs.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I thank my party colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, for tabling this motion.  I support in full the expressions of the various Members of the Opposition.  To fully appreciate the position of special needs children, their parents and friends, one must consider the circumstances that obtain from the time the parents suddenly realise their child has special needs, be they profound or otherwise.  From this moment, parents set about, in every way possible, to give that child an even break.  They do not always succeed but they make valiant efforts to do so.  They go to the ends of the earth to find a means of doing so and they scrimp, save and make great personal sacrifices.The State has a certain responsibility in addition to parents.  It is ironic, given that there seems to have been ignorance of certain events in society, that people who took risks with the future of the people and the country seem to be absolved of all responsibility.  It seems very harsh that, at this time, the Government is deciding to take it out on the vulnerable, the children with special needs and their parents and friends.  What an appalling vista to unfold in front of us at this time.This is regarded as a caring and compassionate nation.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who is a decent man, and the Minister to visit some of the schools affected, such as St. Raphael's in Celbridge.  I challenge them, having visited the mainstream schools, met the children and talked to their parents, to return to the House to tell us they do not care.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	545	I, too, commend Deputy Brian Hayes on tabling this motion.  Some 350 SNAs have been removed already.  There is no independent appeals process and parents cannot seek justice for their children.  The cynical former Minister for Education and Science asked Senator Healy Eames in the Seanad whether she really believes that, where a child is developing independence and confidence, he should continue to receive support he does not need, support that could inhibit his further development.  No parents believe that outrageous assertion.The reality of the Government's approach to children is that there is an inability and unwillingness to implement the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  There are children with disabilities in institutions with no independent inspectorate and they have no protection.  As Deputy Ring suggested, it is a case of billions for the bankers and cruel and crass cuts for our children.Having produced SNAs, having done the good thing and put in place a service that was not available when my children were young, the Government should not cut the service.  I have two children with disabilities.  Both live independent lives because I could afford the resources to help them do so but the Government is depriving parents and children affected today, and those of the future, of the same opportunity.  Not alone is it cruel, unkind, immoral and unethical, it is also penny wise and pound foolish.  For many of the children in question, retaining the SNAs could be the difference between an independent life and a life under State care.  Not doing so is reprehensible.  The Tánaiste, wherever she is, should leave the kids alone and give them back their future.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I thank all the members of the public from all parts of the country who have taken the time to attend this debate.It is an absolute disgrace that when the Minister for Education and Science completed her speech, she left this Chamber.  Not only did she refuse to listen to the Members on this side of the House, she also refused to listen to some of the very fine and constructive contributions made by her backbenchers and other Members on the Government side.  Deputy Gogarty referred to a meeting of minds.  I very much regret that the Minister chose to walk out of the debate in the manner she did tonight.Three hours were allowed for this debate in our Parliament.  The reason people are in the Gallery and elsewhere in the House to listen to this debate was summed up very well by Deputy Wall, who asked why parents of children with special needs must fight for everything.  That is exactly what is happening in 2010 although we believed we had surmounted the problem in the past ten or 15 years.  Parents must fight for everything.The Minister's speech tonight was a cut-and-paste version of the speech on this topic given by the former Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, in the Seanad a month ago.  Line for line, it is the same, and it was written by some civil servant.I repeat the allegation that this is a cost-cutting exercise.  We now have the evidence.  Three hundred and fifty posts are gone this year and the review is not over.  In the past three months, I have been asking the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, for this information.  The joint committee could not even obtain it.  Why is the Dáil treated like a complete doss-house?  That is exactly the way in which the Government and its unelected quangos treat this House.  Why could the information not be given to me and other colleagues over the past few months?Suddenly tonight, by miraculous intervention on the NCSE website, we have the information.  What an affront to the Parliament and the elected Members of this House.  As Deputy Stanton said, none of the three Ministers referred to the Special Education Appeals Board, set up under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, and to the fact that €330,000 has been spent on it to date.  They have not used this information because they are afraid to ask independent people outside the NCSE to examine decisions that have been made.  That is a fact.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I am proud of our achievements regarding special needs in recent years.  We have taken people to the top of a mountain and have shown them the opportunities on the other side.  However, the Government is making sure they go down the same side of the mountain.The motion before the House simply asks that we go back to basics and get the criteria right.  We recognise it is 17 years since the SERC put criteria in place and that much has changed.  We recognise that the independent report, available on the NCSE website, shows the complication in schools today.  Children from complex and varied backgrounds are entering school communities and all kinds of behavioural issues must be contended with.  The notion that we can put children into very simple boxes — the mild, the acute and the rest — is not valid.  Children come in various forms.  We have come a long way in 17 years and the motion, by way of the review we propose, seeks to redress the problems that arise.I, as one of the Opposition spokespersons on education, have not mentioned the school in my constituency because it would lead to the charge of my being parochial, but I will speak about St. Joseph's Special School in Balrothery in Tallaght.  The four people who were given their marching orders last week under the NCSE review are present in the Gallery.  They are great people and do an extraordinary job.  We are now making the people who do an extraordinary job redundant.  We are breaking the relationship they have with those children and that school community and we are going to put them back on the dole.  What about that for joined-up Government?In the same school, at the very first public meeting we had on this, a very brave man stood up and said: "I can't read or write, I have two children in this school, and by God what happened to me will not happen to them."  What we have done to special needs people in this country is the result of years of neglect.  Bear in mind the extraordinary story Deputy Barrett told during the debate, as regards how an intervention can change the life of one person.  This is not a matter of whether we want more or less SNAs, but rather of recognising that there cannot be inclusion without SNAs.  That is exactly what this motion is about.In conclusion, I believe the NCSE is doing the Government's dirty work for it.  I believe the NCSE has been told to cut back.  We know that 353 have been cut back, so how many more will there be by the end of the year?We know this is happening.  At a time when more children are coming into schools with all the variety of assessments that are needed, how is this possible at this stage that we have less?  I do not believe the propaganda from the Government and I very much hope, even at this late stage in the debate, that some backbench Members will abstain on the Government amendment tonight.  That, more than anything else, will send a positive signal to the effect that the policy of the Government and the NCSE is wrong for children, education and the future of this country.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me raise this matter, namely, the unsatisfactory operation of the requirements for the issue of firearms certificates under the recently amended legislation which has resulted in widespread confusion, uncertainty, dissatisfaction and the need for a review.A number of specific issues require attention.  I refer in the first instance to section 3D of the Firearms Act 1925, as inserted by the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which specifically refers to the short firearm for which applicants are making their application for review; this application can be accepted once the person has held the firearm on or before 19 November 2008.  This is being interpreted by Garda superintendents in a way that is giving rise to an element of uncertainty.  It is up to many applicants to proceed to court in a way that, to my mind, was not envisaged and which is unfair.I make the case that the new firearms legislation is flawed because it fails to include the statutory requirement for superintendents to provide a licence to hunt.  There have been complaints from many firearms owners about the new application form which is nine pages long.  Many applicants require assistance with this, which on occasion is not forthcoming.The hunting endorsement on the firearms licence must be legally valid.  The licence-holder must make a declaration under section 29 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended.  Without this, new licences may be rendered invalid.  There is no reference to this declaration or to this section on the revised form issued from the Garda Síochána, having been approved by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Garda Síochána is, by and large, co-operative but the process is giving rise to much uncertainty.  There is a perception, supported by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that legally held firearms are inextricably linked to criminal activity and organised crime when Government representatives speak of a proliferation of guns and a gun culture.  This is without foundation, in my view.  I ask that evidence be provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as to abuse of firearms licences and to provide evidence where sportsmen, many of whom have engaged in what was regarded as a lawful sporting pursuit and activity, are involved in criminal activity and organised crime.  We need to have this matter addressed.  The new application is flawed on the basis that, unlike the old form, it does not comply with section 29(1) of the Wildlife Act.  I ask the Minister to advise the House on the discussions that took place between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the redrafting of the form.  I ask that the guidelines issued to superintendents be published and made available to applicants.  I would regard it as a breach of natural justice if they are not made available because it would result in a most unsatisfactory and opaque situation whereby people are asked to comply with guidelines which have not been published.Long-standing firearms licence holders are being required to produce references in a way that is unduly harsh and unfair.  The system is a shambles.  Many applicants are being forced to the courts and the District Court is being flooded by appeals against refusals by chief superintendents to grant firearms licences.I urge the Government to accept the seriousness of the problem, undertake a review in order to ensure those applicants who have held firearms certificates for many years can continue to pursue their sporting activity within the law and deal with the gross mistake of refusing to make reference to the appropriate declaration under the Wildlife Acts, which in my view puts every hunter in the country in breach of the law.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.As Deputy Charles Flanagan will appreciate, that Department is at present in the course of a major transformation of the firearms licensing system.  It has brought into operation long overdue changes, such as the requirement for referees, provision for background medical checks and standards for the safe keeping of guns in the home for all firearms licence applicants.  At the same time, it has given effect to the major policy changes which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced in November 2008, particularly in regard to a handgun ban.  The Minister does not pretend that a such major transformation can take place without glitches but he would caution against people characterising the system as being in difficulty when in reality they simply do not accept the decisions which have been made on their applications.The changes required enormous work and effort behind the scenes both on the legislative side and from the point of view of information technology design and infrastructure, outsourcing of fee collection and production and publication of guidelines.  The Department is in effect moving from a regime designed in 1925 to a 2009 licensing system which reflects modern conditions.  The new three year licence with outsourced fee collection and licence production will result in a better service to the public and substantial administrative savings to the Garda Síochána.  The objective is a careful consideration of each firearms licensing application in accordance with the law.The Garda Commissioner has produced substantial guidelines to facilitate applicants and these are available on the Garda website along with the application forms and a host of other useful information for licensed firearms owners.  The firearms policy unit in Garda headquarters, which was established by the Commissioner in 2008, has done excellent work in ensuring that advice and guidance are available to gardaí on the ground as well as to the shooting associations.The logistics of moving from one to three year certificates were complicated and to make the changeover work the Commissioner extended existing certificates without charge by between one and ten months.  The longest of the extended one year firearm certificates are due to expire on 30 June 2010.  The Garda authorities recently ran an advertisement in the national newspapers highlighting the fact all firearms owners who have not yet done so should apply for the new three year certificate if they wish to retain their firearm.  The Minister understands that some people who had old guns lying around for years and licensed them annually because it was the easiest thing to do may now be inclined to scrap their firearms rather than meet the requirements of the new more stringent system.  Some of these firearms were in such poor condition that they would have been unsafe to fire and it is no bad thing to send them for scrappage.  The Minister is not exaggerating when he says that some of the old guns handed in for disposal were held together more by duct tape than by wood and metal.Due to this response and the restrictions which the Minister has introduced, we can expect to see a drop in the overall number of licensed firearms in the country.  Garda statistics show that almost 100,000 applications are on the system, 81,000 certificates have already been granted and the number of refusals stands at approximately 550.  A number of appeals are being pursued in the District Court, as provided for by section 15A of the Firearms Act 1925, but I do not propose to comment in detail on these other than to say they represent a small percentage of the overall number of applications for the new three year licence.  Some appeals have been successful but others have not.  Our law provides for such an appeal system and it would be disingenuous to characterise a variety of judicial decisions as confusing.The transition phase will be completed in three months time, at which point we will have a better and safer system in which both firearm owners and members of the Garda Síochána are free from the frenzied renewal of certificates every August.  Every licensed firearm will be required to be securely stored when not in use.  Firearms holders need only to renew every three years and can pay for their certificates at post offices, over the telephone or via the Internet.  The system will have much greater transparency and the process for obtaining or renewing a firearms certificate will be clear to prospective applicants.The Minister took on board the Deputy's suggestion that the legislation should include a provision that the Garda Commissioner submit an annual review of the operation of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2009 and the Minister shall lay a copy of it before the Oireachtas.  It makes sense that we would wait a few months for the completion of the transition phase before taking the opportunity to review the process in the autumn.

I met him in Granard last Thursday, when he had a conversation with a woman from Athlone who is heavily involved in this issue.Although head shops are a recent phenomenon, I am sure they are in every constituency in the country.  In the midlands, they have sprouted up in Athlone, Mullingar and Roscommon over the past 12 months and now assume a prominent position in the lives of these towns.  They are given silly names like "Phantasia" or "Health Store" to persuade people into thinking they are good shops offering healthy wares.  However, they are full of what I can only describe as lethal drugs.  These products are supposedly made from plants and all things wonderful in nature.  I do not know what they are made from but their application is potentially injurious to young people.  Despite their dangers, crowds swirl around these head shops day and night to buy whatever it is they sell.  These customers are fooling themselves and their parents into believing they are buying wonderful new palliatives which will bring them deep sleep or success in examinations.  However, these products are lethal.Two weeks ago, more than 400 people attended a meeting in Athlone to discuss head shops.  They are not prepared to wait three months for Europe to issue a directive and another ten months for it to enter Irish law.  They want to know whether the Government can act now to bring criminal charges against those who peddle these wares.  Can the Government take any action now which would bring about criminal charges on those who peddle these wares?  These products are drugs.  They are pure drugs from a particular source and are harmful, especially to young people.  One particularly harmful product is called bath salts.  One may believe one would use them to have a bath or something but one inhales them and then one becomes flaked out.  I listened to people who told the stories of their young folk and teenagers.  I was deeply dismayed to hear what young people are going through and what is being peddled to them from shops with titles such as "Health Store".The Minister could make a name for himself in his new job were he to strike at these headshops, within the law, and bring comfort, especially to parents who are very concerned about their young people because of the effects these drugs are having.  I hope the Minister will not refer to a proposal of three months or six months duration because these are spreading from town to town like a disease or a plague.  There is a proliferation of these shops and there are crowds of young people who believe their day is not complete if they have not visited a headshop and purchased some of these very potent materials.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this issue and for her good wishes.  The Deputy's assertion is correct.  When I was in this Department in 2007 and 2008, head shops were beginning to be an issue at that time.  There were 26 such shops known to be in operation, primarily in Dublin.  I agree with Deputy O'Rourke and others who have raised the matter on the Order of Business and I understand the matter will be raised during Question Time tomorrow as well.  There is no doubt these shops are a pernicious influence.  I wish to outline the measures under way at the moment and those contemplated by the Government.I assure Deputies that I am aware of the many concerns that have been expressed in recent times regarding the activities of head shops and the new psychoactive substances, represented as legal highs, which are being sold in these outlets.  The number of these outlets has increased significantly in recent times and it is estimated that there are now in excess of 100 in operation in various parts of Ireland.While working as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, my colleague, Deputy John Curran, voiced concerns which I share.  As Deputy O'Rourke mentioned, there are potential health hazards arising from the use of these products and there is a possibility that their use may act as a gateway to the use of illicit drugs, which may be more important than the first point.  The National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 includes two actions aimed at addressing the issues involved.  Action 14 calls for the monitoring of the activities of head shops and all businesses involved in the sale of psychoactive substances, with the objective of ensuring that no illegal activity is undertaken and for appropriate steps to be taken to reform legislation in this area where it is deemed to be appropriate.  Action 15 recommends that drugs-related legislation be kept under continuous review, with a particular focus on new synthetic substances and new or changed uses of psychoactive substances, against the background of EU and broader international experience and best practice.Against the background of these actions and as provided for under the drugs strategy, the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, held several meetings with the Ministers for Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in recent months.  He also met with the Garda Commissioner and with senior officials of various Departments and offices.  Head shops and the sale of legal highs were discussed at many of these meetings and various approaches to addressing the activities of these outlets were considered and are still under review.Through the Misuse of Drugs Act, the primary legislation through which these substances can be regulated, the Department of Health and Children is currently finalising regulations to introduce controls on a range of substances.  These regulations will make the possession and sale of these substances illegal and subject to criminal sanctions.  I stress the term "criminal sanctions".  In preparing the required regulations, that Department is consulting with the relevant authorities to ensure that any legitimate uses of the substances involved are not impinged upon.  This is an issue especially in the manufacture of other products and veterinary medicine.Meanwhile, the Government has approved the commencement of a required notification process to the EU and it is envisaged that the regulations controlling the various substances will come into effect in late June at the conclusion of the three month process involved.  I assure the House the three month period will apply rather than a period of 13 months which Deputy O'Rourke suggested.  Such notification is required under the relevant EU technical standards directives, because controls under the Misuse of Drugs Act involve a restriction on trade.  For example, some of the products involved can be used in the manufacture of plastics and industrial solvents, and the European Medicines Agency reported in late January that one such product, mephedrone, has the potential to be used in the manufacture of some medicines.  It is vital that all regulatory controls introduced meet all requirements and are fully robust to meet any legal challenges subsequently arising.  The experience to date has been that as soon as one substance is banned, a single ingredient can be changed and then one must start almost all over again.  We wish to try to anticipate that taking place again and avoid any possible striking down of either the legislation or regulations.Meanwhile, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs has been asked to carry out some research in this area.  In addition, the activities of head shops are being closely monitored on an ongoing basis by the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise with a view to ensuring that no substances that are currently illegal are being sold.  My Department has also been in contact with the Attorney General about a range of possible approaches to the matter and a number of issues arising in that context are being considered at senior level within an inter-departmental framework.It is very important that we do everything possible to raise awareness about the negative effects of consuming psychoactive substances.  In this regard the HSE, in association with its partners under the drugs strategy, is currently finalising a national drugs awareness campaign that will focus on psychoactive substances legally available through head shops.  This campaign will be aimed primarily at 15 to 40 year olds, as well as at parents and service providers.  The key message of the campaign will be that legal does not mean safe, and it will aim to raise awareness of the risks to mental and physical health associated with these substances.National and local initiatives will be integrated under the campaign, with drugs task forces playing a key role in publicising the information in their respective communities.  The upgraded www.drugs.ie website will also be promoted as a primary source of relevant and accurate information, along with the utilisation of existing HSE help and information lines.  The HSE is also updating the Facts about Drugs booklet and its parent information guide to include information on psychoactive substances.  An information booklet for service providers will be available in conjunction with the launch of the campaign in the coming weeks.We are all aware of the harm caused by drug misuse to individuals, their families and their communities.  This harm manifests itself in many ways, through negative health, socio-economic impacts and crime, such as the intimidation and violence often orchestrated and perpetrated by those supplying drugs in our communities.  Head shops and legal highs might be regarded as a relatively new aspect of the ever-evolving issue of substance misuse in our society but I am determined to tackle the problem and to pursue all viable approaches to counter the potential threats.I note with interest the media reports today that the owners of these shops have discussed drawing up a code of conduct for the shops.  They are perfectly entitled to pursue this course of action but I can assure those same owners that the Government will be working without delay to ensure that the substances, which are of such concern to communities throughout the country, are no longer freely available and, where possible, are removed from circulation for good.  Self-regulation was attempted in 2007 and 2008.  It was not accepted by the Government then and I have no intention of accepting it now either.  I assure Deputy O'Rourke that the issue of head shops and new psychoactive substances is of serious concern to the Government and that I will continue to work with my ministerial colleagues in tackling the problem as effectively as possible.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	555	I wish to share time with Deputy John O'Mahony.  I will be very brief because I have raised this issue before.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I wish him well.  I have raised this matter on two occasions in this Dáil.  The OPW has funding in place and has submitted a report to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  On two occasions in this House it was confirmed to me that a meeting was to take place between the OPW and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  That meeting was to take place a number of weeks ago.  Today, I learned from the Department that again that meeting has not taken place.Tonight I will be nice to the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, because it is the first night that I have dealt with him.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I want to assure him, his Department and his officials, as Deputy O'Mahony will confirm, that I was at a very angry meeting in Hollymount a number of weeks ago.  The only reason that they held off on coming up and taking over the Minister of State's offices and the offices of the National Parks and Wildlife Service is they are waiting for this meeting to take place between the OPW and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.The OPW, in fairness, has drawn up a plan, which I have seen.  They are not happy with the second report but they are prepared to go ahead with it.  The funding is in place, and we are now waiting for clearance from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.I want the Minister of State to understand this.  There is a family in that area whose house has been flooded.  The water destroyed their home, and it nearly happened again in November and December last when there were serious floods in this country.  People in the cities may not realise, even though they themselves had a bit of flooding.  We heard all about the flooding as soon as it occurred in Dublin.  We heard about a little drink of water in some of the gardens. However, these people's homes were destroyed.  Their lands were destroyed.I ask the Minister of State to confirm to me tonight that he will direct the National Parks and Wildlife Service tomorrow to have that meeting next week.  If he does that, at least we can move the process on.  I hope at that meeting, when it takes place, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the OPW, between them, can agree a proper channel to go and we can get these works done.  The money is in place and we want the work done.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I thank Deputy Ring for sharing his time.  I acknowledge that he has been working on this for many years.  As he stated, I attended that public meeting.  What was articulated that night was this process of report after report, and finally, now we have the concern of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  If it was not so serious it would be funny.  Attending that meeting, I got the feeling that if it was wildlife that were living in the house that was flooded, there would be something done about it but because it is people, there seems to be obstacles and legislation.Very simple measures will solve the problem in the Hollymount-Roundfort region.  It is at a tipping point.  It would take very little.  It would not in any way damage the environment or anything else.  One can rely on people in rural areas.  They have looked after the environment better than most over the years.I add my support to this matter, and Deputy Ring, to bring it to a conclusion.  I would appeal to the Minister of State to do that by having this meeting and letting the available funding be spent on alleviating the problem for the people of Hollymount and Roundfort.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	559	I share the Deputies' concern about repeated flooding in the Roundfort-Hollymount area of County Mayo and the need for remedial action.  That area around Ballinrobe, Coolabaun, Kilcommon, Rahard and Caravilla is one of Ireland's finest and I express my best wishes to all those affected by the flooding in that area.  Indeed, my own home was flooded six years ago and I know all about having to leave a house when the flood waters rise.  It is one of the most difficult experiences that a family can have.In determining how best to address this issue, the Office of Public Works, which proposes to undertake this work, must take into consideration that the area concerned involves two turloughs, which are part of the Kilglassan-Caheravoostia turlough complex special area of conservation, SAC.  As such, it is protected under the European Union habitats directive.  I am sure the Deputies agree that compliance with European Union directives must be a priority for this Government and they would be the first to point out were we to breach those directives.As they may well know, turloughs are lakes which disappear underground for part of the year.  They are a unique feature of this country and an irreplaceable part of our natural heritage.  They are among the most distinctive of our semi-natural landscapes, and many are of international importance.  This complex in Mayo is one of the most important and is host to a wide range of habitats.  Turloughs are also listed for priority protection under the habitats directive.  Where proposed works would affect Natura 2000 sites, such as in this case, it is obligatory that the procedures adopted in considering and implementing proposals are in compliance with this directive.Article 6(3) of the habitats directive requires that an appropriate assessment be undertaken of any proposals for works which would be likely to have a significant impact on the site.  This assessment has to consider the effects of the proposed works on the protected habitats.  My Department is advising the OPW on whether its assessment of the impact of the proposed works has ruled out the possibility of damage to the site.If it is found that such works would have an adverse impact on the site, in view of its conservation objectives, it may only proceed if certain steps outlined in the derogation provisions of Article 6(4) of the habitats directive are complied with.  This includes all possible alternative solutions being thoroughly examined and excluded.  It also requires that a case be made that the works should go ahead due to imperative reasons of over-riding public interest and that all necessary compensatory measures must be taken.  In cases where priority habitat is present on the site, the Commission may also need to be consulted before works can proceed.In the case under consideration, it is important that the particular flood alleviation methods proposed by the OPW do not damage the hydrology of the turlough complex, causing reduction or disappearance of the turloughs in normal years when water levels at the site would not be expected to give rise to concerns.My Department has received proposals from the Office of Public Works for drainage operations to alleviate the flooding problem, and has examined the associated assessment.  My Department's role is to advise on the quality of the assessment in so far as the likely impacts on the site are concerned.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department has arranged to meet the OPW in early April in order to arrive at an optimum solution to the flooding problem.  I thank the Deputies for raising the question.

#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	563	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic, namely the serious disadvantage at which the farming community on Clare Island and, indeed, all of the islands, are as regards their income from farming.First, these farmers were ready and willing to join REPS 4, but could not put their plans together because all of the planners were taken up with the farming plans for farmers on the mainland.  Then it was withdrawn overnight, effectively, before they had a chance to get their plans formalised.  In addition to all of the other cutbacks in farming that these communities have experienced, they have had no income from REPS and, therefore, 60% of their farming income was effectively wiped away.On behalf of these farmers, I appeal for special consideration.  The new scheme is a contentious scheme that has yet to come into place.  If it comes into place, however, I ask that some special consideration be given to the farmers on the islands for a 50% top-up on the new scheme that would replace REPS, that a special island top-up would be given to those in REPS 4 who are in the scheme and, for instance, that the outstanding payments to farmers who were given grants under the farm waste management scheme would be paid up-front.  It is only right and proper.These people on the islands are at a serious disadvantage.  I have a list of produce that must be transported off the island and requirements that must be brought onto the island, and the extra costs involved for those people.I appeal to the goodwill of the Minister of State.  This is not something that will cost millions of euro.  What we are asking for is a fair crack of the whip for these farmers.  I ask that they be given special consideration, both in regard to the old REPS 4 scheme, if they got into it, and in the new scheme, when it is finalised.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	564	Will the Minister pay the people entitled to REPS 4 as they have been waiting some time for their money?  If the Minister of State wants environmental schemes to work, those participating must be paid on time.  This scheme will not work if farmers do not enter into it.  As €5,000 is the maximum payment available, it will not be worthwhile for many of them.From what I know from the islands in County Mayo, island life is difficult with high costs for bringing goods in and out.  The Government should provide some form of a top-up to keep island farmers at work.  Every summer, and increasingly during the winter months, many tourists visit the islands.  It is important they are kept as tourist attractions.  However, island inhabitants cannot continue to live on their islands if the resources and money to assist them are not provided.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	565	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  I congratulate Deputy Cuffe on his recent ministerial appointment and wish him well in it.Up to 9,000 farmers have not been paid their REPS 4 payment, which they were promised last October would be paid by Christmas 2009.  All sorts of technicalities concerning their applications are being thrown at them.  Yet part of the problem is many of them cannot get information on what is wrong, if anything, with their applications.The Monaghan REPS office has a shortage of staff.  With the public sector work-to-rule and officials not getting mileage allowances, many of them have not turned up at the office meaning a backlog of applications has emerged.I know several farmers and their consultants who have gone to the office to get their forms brought forward.  Until they can get the forms down to the Environmental Protection Agency at the Johnstown Castle Estate, County Wexford, they cannot get paid.  The farmers in question are in financial desperation.  One had to sell his breeding stock to pay his ESB bill or else the supply would have been cut off.While it may seem like a small scheme to some, to many others it is a matter of life and death.  Whatever it takes, will the Minister ensure the personnel are put in place to deal with these applications and ensure its recipients are paid?Everyone knows the banks are not easy to deal with these times.  It is hard to explain to a farm family, however, that billions of euro can be found to underpin the banks and other financial institutions while the REPS 4 moneys are held up, which they believe is because the Government does not have to pay them.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I thank the Deputies for their best wishes on my ministerial appointment.  Our islands are a rich repository of our culture, archaeology and social heritage.  Long may that continue.  For the past 30 years, I have gone to the islands such as Inisheer and Inishbofin off Connemara for my holidays.  I have yet to have the privilege to visit Clare Island and the other Mayo islands but I am sure I will get the opportunity and look forward to it.There are two islands off the Mayo coast on which farmers are participating in REPS 4.  There were five applicants on Clare Island, and eight on Inishturk.  Of these 13 applicants, nine have been paid to date; one of the others has regrettably died.  Another submitted his application in 2009 after the annual closing date of 15 May, which is fixed by EU regulations.  Accordingly, his REPS contract could not start until January this year and he will receive his first payment later in the year.There are outstanding issues with the other two applications and my officials have been dealing with these.  In one case an adjusted plan has been received in the Department.  This is being examined and I would hope that payment can issue shortly.  In the remaining case, the Department is awaiting a response to a query from the farmer.There are also 20 participants in REPS 3 and all are paid up to date.  I appreciate the particular difficulties experienced by island farmers and I am committed to ensuring the outstanding REPS 4 issues are resolved as quickly as possible.  In recognition of the difficulties which island farmers face because of their location, island participants under REPS 4 receive an additional 15% on payment rates towards the costs of carrying out their agri-environment undertakings.I am aware of the income and cash-flow difficulties which many farm families are experiencing.  Every effort has been, and continues to be made, to ensure all payments issuing from the Department are up to date and that farmers do not experience any undue delay in receiving payments.  With the exception of specific cases where particular difficulties have arisen, I can confirm that payments under the various schemes administered by my Department, and particularly the main schemes such as the single payment scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme, are up to date.Payments for 2009 REPS 4 commenced on 18 December 2009 and continue to issue on a weekly basis.  As of 30 March, 20,445 farmers had been paid in full out of 28,842 who are due payments, that is over 70% of participants.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	567	That makes no difference to the other 30% of participants.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	568	The first stage payment of 75% for 2009 is on the way to another 666 applicants who will receive payment in the next few days.The other cases are still under query.  To meet the requirements of EU regulations, applications for REPS payments have to go through an exhaustive series of administrative checks before payment can be released.  In a significant number of cases, those checks raised issues and queries which required further detailed examination.  Departmental staff are working to resolve these as quickly as possible.Many of these cases require the applicants' planners to amend the farm plans that were submitted originally.  Where this is the case, the applicants concerned have been made aware of the position and the applications will be further processed without delay on receipt of amended plans.The House will be aware from previous debates that there were also delays in processing payments in a small number of local offices due to staff shortages.  This has arisen from the Government decision in March 2009 to introduce a moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service to control public expenditure and numbers in public sector.  This moratorium forms a key element in the Government's policy to control public expenditure.As a result, my Department has been unable to fill several vacancies.  I am endeavouring to put alternative arrangements in place to ensure the prompt processing of claims.I hope the current delays in some REPS cases will not detract from the overall merit of REPS.  The scheme has been one of the most successful operated by the Department since its launch in 1994.  It has delivered multiple benefits to the environment with water quality, biodiversity, conservation and landscape enhancement.  It has also brought welcome income benefits to farmers, with more than €342 million paid out to REPS participants last year and a total of more than €2 billion paid since 1994.  Payments in 2009 reached their highest level ever.   The original allocation for last year was just €330 million but additional funds were provided in December last and approved by the Dáil by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  Payments due to REPS farmers this year will continue at this high level.Notwithstanding the Government's decision to close REPS to new entrants in July last year, which was unavoidable given the state of the public finances, the contracts to those farmers in the scheme will be honoured in full.  This means there will still be farmers in REPS right up to the end of 2014.  By the time the scheme finally comes to an end, payments to farmers will have exceeded €3 billion.Yesterday, I launched a new agri-environment options scheme, partly funded by the EU but which will also get substantial support from the Exchequer.  The Minister for Finance has agreed to provide for payment to approximately 10,000 participants at a maximum of €5,000 a year.The new scheme focuses on the priority areas of biodiversity, water management and climate change.  The shape of the new scheme reflects the increasing emphasis at EU level of having schemes that deliver clearly identifiable and measurable benefits to the environment.It consists of a menu of actions from which farmers can select those that complement the environmental profiles of their farms.  The majority of participants will be able to reach the maximum payment of €5,000 while many others will get very close to that figure.I thank the Deputies for bringing to my attention the understandable frustration experienced by some REPS applicants.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	572	The Central Statistics Office provides monthly reports on the number of overseas visitors coming to Ireland, including the country of origin, but this data is not broken down according to tourism regions.In any event, the new pre-clearance facility in Shannon is only operational since August 2009 and it would be too soon to estimate its impact on tourism numbers, in advance of its first full year of operation.With regard to the pre-clearance facility, as an island destination, direct, convenient and competitive access services are vital for our Tourism industry and it is important, in the current challenging global climate, to help sustain strategically important capacity, routes and services.In that context, the new pre-clearance facility at Shannon will present an opportunity to help sustain existing air services and will also, in due course, help create opportunities for new routes and services.  However, as the facility is primarily of benefit in terms of passengers leaving Ireland for the US, including transit passengers, it is not directly of benefit to all tourists.Nonetheless, I am advised that Tourism Ireland is committed to promoting the pre-clearance facility as part of its overall destination marketing campaigns and cooperative marketing activity with carriers.  In addition, Shannon Development, as the regional tourism development body, is working with the national tourism agencies and Shannon Airport Authority on a number of new initiatives to specifically promote the facility.These include a new website jointly funded by Shannon Development, Shannon Airport Authority, IHF and local trade to sell the advantages of the pre-clearance facility for Airlines, Charters, Passengers and Private Jet users, and a joint programme to identify and follow up with new potential aviation and tourism targets, including charter companies and tour operators, who would benefit from the new facility at Shannon International Airport.In terms of tourism marketing generally, €44.25m is being provided this year for the Tourism Marketing Fund.  This will allow Tourism Ireland to continue to promote the mid west vigorously and extensively through its ongoing global marketing activity and through specific, additional campaigns undertaken for the western regions in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Great Britain.In 2010, Fáilte Ireland, will partner with businesses in the Mid West and Shannon region to help them grow their turnover, cut their costs, better manage cashflow and restructure their debt burden through a range of practical business supports.  Furthermore, a new home holiday campaign, overseas regional marketing in key markets, capital investment in tourism projects, business tourism promotion, festivals and events supports — will benefit tourism in general including the industry in the Shannon region.  Finally, the Department's direct funding to Shannon Development has been maintained at its 2009 level.

The three sectoral areas for which I have responsibility, Tourism, Culture and Sport, play a major role in terms of their contribution to employment and have significant potential to contribute to our economic recovery.In particular, our Arts and Culture, which are part of what makes us unique, are associated globally with creativity and imagination.  These important assets underpin and reinforce the branding of Ireland and serve to drive the dynamic growth area of cultural tourism.  As I have said in this House when I was appointed Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, "Our culture is the rose on the table" and I look forward to continuing to ensure that our culture continues to be celebrated, promoted and developed.A great deal of emphasis is placed on sport in this country and it is certainly true that we punch above our weight internationally in many areas of sport.  At national and at local level, much has been achieved so far in terms of facility provision and the development of communities and clubs with major potential for people to participate in sport.  I propose to continue this trend and to set increased participation in sport, which can impact positively on people and their wellbeing, as one of my key objectives.Turning to Tourism, the economic aspects of this sector are very significant.  Some 200,000 people are employed in the sector which generates almost €4b in foreign revenue earnings and a total of €1.2b in tax receipts.  While there are challenges in developing this sector further in the current economic climate, I strongly believe that there is significant potential for growth in tourism particularly by building on the synergies that exist already between the three sectors for which my Department has responsibility.

Before supporting such a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project when completed would have a suitable level of public access.Proposals must comply with the standards set out in the Department's "Procedures for the Planning, Approval and Financing of Swimming Pools and Technical Guidelines".  Under the Guidelines, there are four principal stages in a swimming pool project: Preliminary Report (including Feasibility Study); Contract Documents; Tender and finally Construction.  Local authorities may not proceed to the next stage of a project until prior approval issues from the Department.  The Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works (OPW), evaluates each stage.  Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and the amount is capped at the time of allocation.Under the current programme, 45 pools have been opened throughout the country and twelve other projects are at various stages of the Programme.  Of the 45 pools completed and opened under the current round, 14 are new pools, 21 are replacement pools and 10 are refurbishments.  The 12 remaining pools at various stages in the process consist of 4 new pools, 4 replacements pools and 4 refurbishments.The total expenditure of €142.7m under the Programme from 2000 to the end of 2009 leveraged a total investment of some €400m in swimming pools throughout the country.The allocation of €7.5m in 2010 will be sufficient to meet commitments arising in 2010 under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  No decision has been taken on the timing of a new round of the Programme.

Congratulations should also go to the other four Irish nominations for Academy Awards that unluckily did not capture an Oscar on this occasion.  These were wonderful achievements, against the might of the large studios, and it is something in which all of the Irish audiovisual industry can take great pride.Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB). This agency is funded through my Department and is independent of the Department in its operations.  It is worth pointing out that three of the recent nominations for Academy Awards were for projects that were funded by the Irish Film Board.My Department's primary operational role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 that provides tax relief for investments in qualifying films.  A qualifying film is a film for which the Revenue Commissioners have issued a certificate under Section 481.  The types of film eligible for certification are feature film, television drama, creative documentary and animation.  In 2009 there were 9 animation projects supported under Section 481 with a total Irish budget of €17.7m.An Audiovisual Content Production Industry Strategy Framework Group was established last year that will assist in providing a clear vision for the future of the industry and response to market changes.  The whole area of development of the Irish audiovisual industry (including animation) will be examined as an important part of the work programme of the Group.  Following the receipt of the Framework Report, which I expect to be completed soon, I will examine the recommendations in the Report to ensure that the Irish audiovisual industry has the required supports and opportunities to develop to its full potential.I would also like to add my best wishes to the announcement earlier this week that "Camelot", a new 10 part drama series will commence filming in Ireland in the summer.  This is most welcome news and will, I am sure, build on the success of "The Tudors" that has filmed here over the last few years. It is once again testament to the excellent talent which is available in Ireland, both in front and behind the camera, that a major international series like this has been attracted to these shores.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 87 together.In order to enhance the cultural promotion of Ireland abroad, the Government decided to create the honorary position of Cultural Ambassador.  This decision recognises the worldwide importance of Ireland's culture and its connection to our economy, which was one of the major conclusions of the Global Irish Economic Forum at Farmleigh.The appointment of Gabriel Byrne as Ireland's first Cultural Ambassador was recently announced by the Taoiseach.  Gabriel Byrne is an internationally renowned, award-winning actor and is already well established as one of Ireland's great ambassadors through his work in film and theatre, as well as his endeavours behind the scenes in supporting and promoting Irish artists.It is envisaged that the appointee, drawing on his experience and network of contacts, will help the Irish Government primarily through the offices of my Department to further develop our overall vision and policies for the promotion of Irish arts, culture and the creative industries internationally, and in particular in the United States.  As this is a new position, it is envisaged that the precise extent of the responsibilities involved will evolve in practice and over time and must allow for the fact that Gabriel Byrne has extensive other career commitments.Mr Byrne has already played a key role in helping to develop the concept for the special season of Irish arts in the US in 2011 being organised by Culture Ireland, and as Cultural Ambassador he will be advising Culture Ireland and Ireland's Embassy and Consulates in the US on the creation of a dynamic programme of art, ideas, debate and reflection which will help to foster a renewed, forward-looking cultural relationship between Ireland and America.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	580	The International Sports Tourism Initiative, which is administered by Fáilte Ireland, was set up in 2000 to support the attraction to Ireland of major international sporting events, with tourism potential.  Since 2000 more than 160 events have been supported by this initiative representing an investment of over €50m. The events targeted have the ability to generate significant numbers of international visitors to Ireland and/or extensive international media coverage.Key events supported in the past have been the Tour de France (1998), the Special Olympics (2003), the Ryder Cup (2006), two rounds of the World Rally Championships (2007 and 2009), the Volvo Ocean Race (2009) as well as annual sponsorship of the Irish and the European Golf Open Tournaments for over ten years.  The Solheim Cup which is scheduled to take place in Killeen Castle, Co. Meath in 2011 is also being supported under the initiative.All proposals under the International Sports Tourism initiative are subject to an assessment by Fáilte Ireland of the costs/benefits involved in the provision of State financial support and the impact in terms of international media coverage and/or incremental international visitors.The Deputy will be aware that the Government provided €8m towards the 2009 Volvo Ocean Race Galway stopover. The stopover and its associated festival events, proved very popular and successful with significant economic impact. The Government recently committed €4 million in support of Irish promoters, Let's Do it Global's bid for Galway to host a port stopover in the forthcoming 2011 — 2012 Volvo Ocean Race. That bid was successful and Galway will in fact host the finale of the 2011-2012 event.The Galway stopover is a hugely important win for Ireland. It is estimated that 87,000 people visited the Galway region during last year's stopover and that it had a massive €56 million economic impact on Galway and the West of Ireland.  Hosting the race enabled us to showcase Galway and the West of Ireland to a television audience of some 1. 3 billion people around the world — an incredible marketing opportunity.  The 2011 — 2012 race could well exceed this performance because this time, Galway is the finishing port and the final prize-giving will be held there.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 90, 91 and 160 together.Full-year figures from the Central Statistics Office show a reduction of 11.6% in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland in 2009 compared with 2008.  These figures must be seen in the context of a decline in tourist numbers internationally.  Tourism worldwide in 2009 was deeply affected by the global economic difficulties and loss of consumer confidence, with Ireland particularly hit by exchange rate challenges.  Outbound trips from Great Britain were particularly affected, with the Euro/Sterling exchange rate making it extremely challenging to attract visitors to Ireland and indeed Eurozone destinations generally.There is little doubt that 2010 will also be a challenging year for tourism.  Nevertheless it is important to remember that, despite the downturn, millions of people across the world will still take holidays this year. I know that the industry and the tourism agencies are fighting hard for every bit of this business.  Tourism Ireland has set an ambitious growth target of 3% for overseas visitor numbers and revenues this year, despite international experts predicting a 2% contraction.  Early indications for the peak tourism season are good, with a number of operators reporting positive trends in bookings and enquiries.To assist the tourism sector, an extensive range of marketing, product development, festival and sporting events, training and business supports are being put in place by the Tourism State Agencies under the Tourism Services budget of the Department, which was increased to over €153 million for 2010.   This increased allocation of public resources in the current difficult budgetary situation is clear recognition by Government of the important role that the tourism and hospitality sector can play in Ireland's economic recovery.  The provision of €44.25 million for this year's Tourism Marketing Fund will ensure that the level and value of investment in overseas marketing of Ireland can be maintained in real terms, as recommended by the Tourism Renewal Group.  The Government is also investing for the future of Irish tourism through the trebling of tourism capital funding in 2010.  Indeed on Friday, I announced an allocation of almost €9 million by Fáilte Ireland in the Viking Triangle project in Waterford.Tourism Ireland will be focusing on those major markets that are likely to deliver immediate returns this year including Great Britain, Germany and the US, as research has shown these markets as our best prospects.  Several euro zone economies are beginning to come out of recession and these, of course, are also important source markets for Irish tourism.  €26 million is being invested by Tourism Ireland in a marketing drive in the first half of the year.  This included the recent promotional programme of activities — our biggest ever — to showcase Ireland during the St. Patrick's Day period, including the "greening" of iconic buildings and attractions around the world (including the London Eye, the Empire State Building in New York, the CN Tower in Toronto and the Sydney Opera House).On the domestic front, Fáilte Ireland has committed to its largest ever home holiday marketing programme, as a central plank in its strategy to increase the home market share of the overall Irish leisure break market.  With specific regard to Business Tourism, the opening of the National Convention Centre in Dublin in September will further enhance our capacity to attract international events.Fáilte Ireland is also working closely with tourism businesses all over Ireland.  In particular, during 2009 they refocused their programmes to meet the enterprise support needs of businesses in the tourism sector in the current climate.  In 2010 Fáilte Ireland will be investing almost €11 million in the form of direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.  The industry is responding well to the initiatives and the take up on the programmes is very positive.In terms of our ability to compete in the international arena in the future, maintaining and enhancing competitiveness is a major issue for Irish tourism as it is for the economy as a whole. In addressing that issue, it is important to bear in mind that competitiveness is about more than price and costs.  The tourism agencies continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness as a tourism destination and I am encouraging them to assist the industry in responding to changing conditions as appropriate.  In 2010, great value, distinctive holiday offers are a key focus of the marketing campaigns of both tourism agencies.Of course, while I know that our businesses and tourism agencies are responding positively to current challenges, it is just as important that the strategic framework for tourism development responds to the changing environment.  In this regard, the wide-ranging set of measures recommended in the Tourism Renewal Group's Framework for Action now forms the strategic basis on which Government is responding to the current difficulties.  As I have already outlined in my reply to an earlier Priority Question, good progress is being made on implementing the Renewal Group recommendations.Tourism is also a key element of the Government's wider strategy for economic renewal and, building on the recommendations of the Renewal Group, the sector was included in a range of beneficial cross-cutting measures and initiatives — including the Employment Subsidy Scheme, the Work Placement Programme and the Credit Review System.To conclude, I am fully aware of the many issues affecting the tourist industry.  However, I believe that, drawing on the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group and complemented by general supports for enterprise, my Department is identifying the right measures and is working with other Government Departments and the tourism agencies to drive their delivery, in order to position the tourism sector for recovery and growth as the Irish and global economies get back on track.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Although not every foreign visitor to Ireland requires a visa to travel here, those from many of the countries identified as "New and Developing Markets" do typically require visas to enter Ireland.  Tourism Ireland's review of New and Developing Markets (including India, China and 17 other markets), which was completed in late 2007, found that visitors from these markets stay twice as long as the average holidaymaker, have the highest spend per visit, have a higher propensity to travel throughout the island of Ireland and make significant economic contributions to many elements of the tourism sector.  The review also highlighted the potential for increased tourism from Asia and the Middle East and set significant targets — to attract a total of 475,000 visitors from New and Developing Markets by 2013.  While these targets were set in a very different global economic context, they highlight the long-term potential of these markets.To fully exploit the opportunities presented, Ireland needs to be competitive on all fronts.  I am advised that the ability of potential visitors to secure the necessary visas in an efficient and cost-effective manner, when compared with our competitor destinations, is an important element of our competitiveness.  In that context, the relevant Recovery Actions recommended by the Tourism Renewal Group in its Framework for Action put forward a number of options to explore, having regard to the complexity of immigration policy and administration.As the Deputy will be aware, immigration policy is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and its implementation is a matter for the relevant authorities, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  My Department has engaged with the Department of Justice and Law Reform in relation to these and related issues on an ongoing basis, most recently while following up on the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group.I have also written directly to my colleague the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern TD, on the matter.  In addition, An Taoiseach, Brian Cowen TD recently adverted to the issue in his recent address to the Irish Hotels Federation, noting that it had arisen at the Global Irish Economic Forum at Farmleigh.  An Taoiseach acknowledged the competitive disadvantage that our non-participation in Schengen visa arrangements presents, and said he had asked the Department of Justice to look for practical solutions to deal with it.The Deputy will appreciate that migration and border controls are complex and sensitive, affecting not only tourism of various kinds but also labour market policies and inward investment, within the overall context of sovereignty.  However, I am confident that, working in partnership, the immigration authorities and the tourism bodies can ensure that the visitor experiences of Ireland compare well with any of our competitors.

The procurement stage of the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall is currently progressing.  In accordance with the Government Decision, the project is being tendered on a design, build, finance and maintain PPP project basis.  Two participating consortia submitted tenders on 25 September 2009 and these tenders are currently being assessed under the PPP Guidelines set out by the Department of Finance.  Once these evaluations have been finalised a more definite timeline for the project can be established.  As this is a PPP process costs are determined at the time of contract conclusion.While I welcome the opening of the Grand Canal Theatre, which I believe adds significantly to the cultural infrastructure in our capital, it  cannot be considered a replacement or substitute for a National Concert Hall.  An evaluation of the economic benefits of the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall was carried out in 2006 and my Department and the Department of Finance were satisfied with the outcome of this evaluation.  I have no doubt that the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall will make a very substantial contribution to the arts and will provide considerable benefits to the economy.

The SFT is a lifetime limit which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 at an initial level of €5 million and was increased in line with an indexation factor in 2007 and 2008 to its current value of just over €5.4 million. In line with the decision made in Budget 2009, there was no indexation of the SFT for 2009. Penal tax charges apply to any funds in excess of the threshold.The National Pensions Framework does not include specific proposals in relation to the SFT. I am aware, however, of the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on Taxation which, among other things, proposes a reduction in the level of the SFT.  The current level of the threshold will be kept under review as part of the normal Budgetary and Finance Bill process.

Where this relief applies, Stamp Duty is chargeable, at the residential property rates, on the greater of (a) the consideration paid for the site or (b) 25% of the aggregate of the consideration paid for site and the building costs.  The residential property rates of stamp duty are set out in the Table.  I have no plans at this stage to change the existing scheme of Stamp Duty exemptions and reliefs.Aggregate Consideration exceeds €127,000*First €125,000NilNext €875,0007%Excess over €1,000,0009%*Transactions, where the consideration (or the aggregate consideration) does not exceed €127,000, are exempt from Stamp Duty.

A store for agricultural machinery used in connection with an agricultural contracting business is a rateable property under the Valuation Act and the occupier of such a store is therefore liable for commercial rates based on its rateable valuation.  There is no exemption provision under the Act  for machinery stores which are part of a commercial undertaking.While a domestic house is exempt from rates under the Valuation Act, a motor vehicle garage attaching to it, which is used for the parking of commercial vehicles may, depending on the particular circumstances, be deemed to be a rateable entity, if a commercial enterprise is being operated from the premises.There are no plans to provide for special treatment of stores used in connection with agricultural contracting businesses under the Valuation Act, which provides that all buildings used for commercial enterprises are valued in a fair and equitable manner.

The amount chargeable is the aggregate of the amount payable to that individual for one or more days in any income tax week less the first €13 of the aggregate of the amount payable in any income tax week, and any amount payable in respect of a qualifying child.Any income tax liability which may arise is generally collected by ‘coding' the social welfare income into the certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point of the individual.However, jobseeker's benefit payable to a systematic short-time worker is not taxable. A systematic short-time worker is a worker who normally works full-time but, because of a temporary reduction of work in the business, his or her hours per week are reduced for a temporary period.

The Department of Transport seeks the views of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice and Law Reform in relation to applications for exemptions.  If the weapons/munitions are classified as ‘dangerous goods' by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the views of the Irish Aviation Authority are also sought.  If any of these bodies objects, the Minister will not grant an exemption.  Each application for an exemption is also sent to the Department of Defence for information.The 1989 Order amended the 1973 Order to allow the Minister to specify the particular aircraft operation that he may exempt from the requirements of Articles 6 or 7 of the Orders. Previously the 1973 Order had provided for exemptions for a class of aircraft rather than a specific aircraft operation.Regrettably the statistics sought by the Deputy for the number of exemptions granted to date in 2010 cannot be provided due to industrial action.

The Convention provides that the sending state must notify the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, or such other ministry as may be agreed, in the receiving state of the arrival and departure of diplomatic staff, their family members and private servants and the engagement and discharge of persons resident in the receiving state as members of the mission or private servants entitled to privileges and immunities.Persons who are in the State as private domestic workers for foreign diplomats are given an endorsement in their passport by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service which acknowledges their status in the State.  They are not required to be issued with a separate GNIB registration card and accordingly they would not be recorded in the register of foreign nationals from which statistics are extracted.  Therefore the statistical information sought by the Deputy is not available.The person concerned enjoys certain exemptions in respect of taxes and dues in the course of their employment, so long as they are not nationals of or permanently resident in the receiving State.

The majority of claims are dealt with by administrative staff in local District Court Offices. Typical claims are in respect of goods or services purchased from someone selling them in the course of a business for minor damage to a property (excluding personal injuries) and for the non-return of a rent deposit for certain types of dwellings.Since 5th January 2010 the procedure has been expanded to allow for business to business claims of the same nature.  The procedure does not cover claims in respect of debts, personal injuries or breaches of leasing or hire purchase agreements.  Cases of this kind are deemed unsuitable for the mainly administrative nature of the procedure.  I am advised that such cases would be more likely to result in court hearings with a consequential impact on service levels and waiting times for cases to be heard.  Cases relating to debt may of course be dealt with by way of a civil bill.The operation of the small claims procedure is kept under review in my Department.

The design and purpose of the programme is to ensure that the level of care and protection for children and vulnerable adult asylum seekers is equivalent to what is available to all children and vulnerable adults who come into contact with adult service providers in their day-to-day lives. The enforcement of the programme's provisions is part of the RIA oversight of all service provision for asylum seekers, which is kept under constant review.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	632	Gender segregation is just one of several factors considered by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department when formulating policy in the matter of housing asylum seekers. While certain gender-specific accommodation centres are used, the RIA must balance the available accommodation with the population seeking that accommodation. The RIA constantly monitors its accommodation portfolio in order to ensure a safe environment for all, while at the same time working to maintain an efficient and effective use of bed spaces, having regard to the population and profile of those seeking accommodation and the available of suitable accommodation within the portfolio generally.  The RIA's accommodation centres are operated in accordance with standards set out in service contracts. The standards which apply include those related to health and safety, including security for residents and staff. The RIA is satisfied that the accommodation centres where there is multiple profile accommodation have sufficient controls in place to address any perception of a threat to women or other residents. State supports are provided on site at centres and coordinated through the RIA, the HSE, the Department of Education and others. National and local NGO's also provide supports at centres.Resources such as Public Health Nurses, Community Welfare Officers, General Practitioners and school principals also engage with residents and with the RIA on concerns for residents. The RIA operates information clinics whereby residents can discuss any issues which they may have, directly with RIA staff on a one-to-one basis. Should any issue arise at any accommodation centre, there is ample opportunity for such issues to be brought to the attention of RIA and other appropriate authorities.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	633	I am not aware of any specific complaints of the nature outlined in the question. If the Deputy is aware of any such complaints, they should be addressed to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department which has responsibility in the matter.The RIA's accommodation centres are operated in accordance with standards set out in service contracts. The standards which apply include those related to health and safety, including security for residents and staff. State supports are provided and coordinated through the RIA, the HSE, the Department of Education and others. National and local NGO's also provide supports. The RIA operates a Child Protection Policy and has a dedicated unit for Child and Family Supports and also a separate Health Unit dealing with medical needs.All asylum seekers who avail of RIA accommodation are provided with a copy of the current House Rules and Procedures document (House Rules) on arrival at their accommodation which includes details of the complaints procedure which residents can avail of.  The complaints procedure itself has an informal mechanism for local resolution of complaints and disputes and a formal mechanism which can apply where a local resolution cannot be achieved and where the matter is referred to the RIA for consideration. Residents at any of RIA's accommodation centres can raise concerns with centre staff or directly with RIA in accordance with the procedures set out in the House Rules. Resources such as Public Health Nurses, Community Welfare Officers, General Practitioners and school principals also engage with residents and with the RIA on residents' issues. The RIA operates information clinics on-site at all accommodation centres where residents can discuss any issues which they may have directly with RIA staff on a one-to-one basis. The RIA takes any complaints about its centres seriously, including any complaints about centre staff, once these complaints are brought to its attention with sufficient detail to allow an investigation.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	634	At the outset, I have to correct the assertion in the question that applicants for asylum are not allowed to live outside Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) accommodation while their applications are being considered. This is manifestly not so, as many applicants choose to live independently outside RIA accommodation centres.For those who require accommodation and associated supports from the State while their applications are pending, RIA accommodation centres provide a secure environment where violence of any sort, domestic or otherwise, towards any person, regardless of gender, is not tolerated under any circumstance.Where incidents of domestic violence are brought to the attention of the RIA, steps are immediately taken to address the matter. For example, where separate living arrangements become a requirement for a family due to domestic violence, the RIA facilitates these arrangements. Also, where children may have been exposed to the sight of domestic violence, such incidents are reported to the HSE social work team for follow up in accordance with the RIA's Child Protection Policy. The system of direct provision allows for a level of supervision of families which would not be found in alternative living arrangements. The availability and visibility of staff, Public Health Nurses, Community Welfare Officers, General Practitioners, Community and Ethnic Liaison Gardaí and others linked in with an accommodation centre serves to help monitor domestic relationships and proves a support for families within the direct provision system.

The Department of Foreign Affairs has been advising the pubic of the extent of these problems through media channels and, in particular, via the Department's website, www.dfa.ie . On 4 March the Passport Service had to withdraw the guarantee of turnaround times for all passport applications.The application number is required for the status of this application to be ascertained. This can be done online.

It was received through the Passport Express service which is a ten day guarantee service that is provided by the Passport Office in partnership with An Post.However, due to industrial action the Passport Express guarantee was suspended on 4 March. As a result it is presently taking up to twenty working days to process Passport Express applications. As applications are being processed on a first come first served basis, the application in question will not be processed until mid-April.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	641	Since the National Museum of Ireland became an autonomous statutory body under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the Board of the Museum is statutorily responsible for operational matters concerning its collection and I, as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism do not have a statutory function in respect of operational matters.However, having regard to the Museum's custodial, preservation and exhibition responsibilities in respect of its collections of Irish material heritage, culture and natural history, I understand that additional storage facilities were required to address concerns regarding the potential exposure of these collections to damage and decay.  This matter was extensively addressed by the Public Accounts Committee in July 2008 as a result of the Special Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General earlier that year.Whilst my Department requested the Office for Public Works to identify a suitable storage facility for this purpose, all negotiations in relation to the site were carried out by that Office, which has responsibility for providing accommodation for Government services and for managing and maintaining the State's property portfolio.  The OPW have advised that they are satisfied that the lease secured represents good value for money and that as the owner of the premises was not amenable to disposing of his interest in the property, the purchase of the premises did not arise.Any matters that may arise between the owner of the property and the National Asset Management Agency are outside the remit of my Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	642	My Department has been in regular contact with the Department of Finance, both bilaterally and through joint participation on the Senior Officials' Group on Economic Renewal, regarding the current difficulties facing the hotel sector.Towards the end of 2009, the Irish Hotels Federation commissioned Peter Bacon & Associates to report on the overcapacity in the hotel industry and the required elements of a recovery programme.  One of the recommendations in the report is to allow relevant hotels to exit the industry without disadvantaging the initial investors in terms of availing of capital allowances.  This is an issue primarily for consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  However, I understand that the retrospective removal of the capital allowance claw back would give rise to serious credibility issues for the operation of such schemes and introduce a moral hazard into any future tax based incentive schemes.  It would also make it very difficult to persuade the EU to allow the introduction of any future schemes for other industries in the event that such proves necessary.  Furthermore, the original accelerated capital allowance scheme for hotels required EU State aids approval and the European Commission would have to approve any amendment to the scheme.The Bacon report makes a number of other recommendations to address the estimated overcapacity of between 12,000 and 15,000 rooms in the hotel sector, many of which are directed to the industry itself.  Where recommendations have been made for Government action, we have, where possible, sought to address them.  For example my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is examining the possibility of a Loan Guarantee Scheme and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government has established the Local Government Efficiency Review Group to review the cost base, expenditure and numbers employed in local authorities.  Initiatives have also been taken to improve credit availability generally.We can expect that 2010 is likely to be another tough year in the hotel sector, with further adjustments taking place as the market responds to excess room supply.  This process will gain further momentum in the coming months as banks seek to clean up their balance sheets and dispose of under-performing loans.  In that regard, it is generally accepted that NAMA will take over many loans associated with the Hotel Sector but will make its own decision as to how those loans and properties are to be managed based upon its own independent assessment of the market.In this environment, managing costs will be key for hotels to survive the current downturn and Fáilte Ireland has implemented a range of measures to help the tourism industry to address costs and competitiveness issues.  In particular, during 2009 Failte Ireland refocused its programmes to meet the enterprise support needs of businesses in the tourism sector in the current climate.  In 2010 Fáilte Ireland will be investing almost €11 million in the form of direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.  The industry is responding well to the initiatives and the take up on the programmes is very positive.In line with recommendations in the Bacon report, robust tourism marketing programmes have been put in place by Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland for the international and domestic markets in 2010.  The international programme, involving a spend of €43m, will place a particular priority on the British, German and US source markets while the biggest ever home holiday programme was launched in March with an associated budget of €4m.

These include work on the Department's website, changing email addresses and the Department's re-titled customer charter.  Provision had already been made this year for the purchase of new headed paper which is required under the Department's Irish Language Scheme so no additional costs arise in this regard. It is estimated that costs of approximately €15,000 will arise mainly in relation to the purchase of new name plaques. These costs will be met from the Department's existing Vote. It is expected that all changes will be effected within a matter of weeks.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	644	I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 162 together.Over the past year and arising from the Global Irish Economic Forum held in Farmleigh, culture has come into renewed focus as a unique national asset and our greatest competitive advantage as a "door opener" in developing important economic and tourism links.  We should never take for granted the extraordinary global profile of Irish arts and culture, which continues to be a unique defining factor driving Ireland's international reputation for creativity, imagination and innovation.As part of the drive to implement the recommendations of both the Global Irish Economic Forum and the Ireland-US Strategic Policy Review, and to maximise the competitive advantages culture offers, two recent initiatives have focussed on the promotion of Irish culture in the United States as a key priority.  Firstly, the Government created the honorary position of Cultural Ambassador and confirmed Gabriel Byrne as the first appointee to this new role.Secondly, a special Irish arts season is to take place in the US in 2011 organised by Culture Ireland, who will collaborate with other State Agencies and the Department of Foreign Affairs in presenting an ambitious programme of events to showcase world class Irish artists and companies. It is intended that this initiative will raise the long-term profile of Irish culture in the US and generate new creative and business opportunities for Irish artists and companies. It also represents a further investment in our unique relationship with America and with the Irish diaspora.In addition to these new initiatives, Culture Ireland will continue to promote Irish artists and arts companies worldwide, generating goodwill and influence for Ireland and highlighting the strength of Irish culture and creativity.  Working in close partnership with other State Agencies including Tourism Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, Culture Ireland will also seek to leverage opportunities to mobilise Ireland's cultural reputation for the benefit of tourism, trade and investment.

The Council is funded by my Department and is independent in its day to day operations, including funding decisions. The allocation to the Arts Council for 2010 is €68.649m.Under the ACCESS programme, my Department is responsible for the provision of capital monies for arts centres, galleries, theatres, etc.  In 2008 and 2009 €52m was expended in respect of such facilities.  A further €16m is allocated in 2010 for regional arts capital projects throughout the country.  Many of these projects are already under construction and will be completed in 2010.  Under this scheme €580,000 has been allocated to the Lantern Municipal Gallery in Kildare.  This project has not yet commenced.  A list of the successful ACCESS II projects and the amount of grant aid allocated to each project is available on my Department's website.  No date has been set for the next round of allocations under the ACCESS programme.

While no decision has been made on the timing of the next round of the Programme, €48 million has been provided in Subhead C1 of my Department's Vote for 2010 to cover payments to be made for sports and recreation facilities which were awarded grants in earlier rounds of the programme.  The Deputy will be aware that since 1998 €725m has been allocated to 7,400 sports facilities throughout the country.  Under the Local Authority Swimming Pools Programme (LASPP) a provision of €7.5m has been made in 2010 which will be sufficient to meet existing commitments under current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  The Deputy will be aware that since 2000, 45 new and refurbished swimming pools have been opened.  No decision has been made on the timing of a new round of the programme.

Details of progress in achieving this goal are set out in the Department's Annual Reports, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library and on the Department's website.  In order to further progress this high-level goal, I will seek to exploit the tourism development opportunities associated with hosting major sporting events in Ireland, encourage close co-operation between Departmental agencies in promoting the image of Ireland abroad, and further develop and exploit the tourism potential of cultural events, in collaboration with the National Cultural Institutions and other relevant Bodies.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	651	I can assure the Deputy that I share the concerns to which he refers regarding the activities of head shops and the new psychoactive substances, represented as "legal highs", which are being sold in these outlets. Indeed, my colleague, Mr John Curran, T.D., while Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, voiced similar concerns on many occasions and held a number of meetings with the Ministers for Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science. He also met with the Garda Commissioner and with senior officials of various Departments and Offices.  Head shops and the sale of "legal highs" were discussed at many of these meetings and various approaches to addressing the activities of these outlets were considered.A primary approach to the head shops issue is to ensure that substances that pose dangers to the public are not available for sale.  In this context, the Department of Health and Children, through the Misuse of Drugs Act, is currently finalising regulations to introduce controls on a range of substances. These regulations will make the possession and sale of these substances illegal and subject to criminal sanctions. In preparing the required regulations, that Department are consulting with the relevant authorities to ensure that any legitimate uses of the substances involved are not impinged upon. Meanwhile the Government has approved the commencement of a required notification process to the EU and it is envisaged that the regulations controlling the various substances will come into effect at the conclusion of the three month process involved. It is envisaged that these controls will impact very significantly on the operation of head shops.Meanwhile, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs has been asked to carry out some research in this area. In addition, the activities of head shops are being closely monitored on an ongoing basis by An Garda Síochána and Revenue's Customs Service with a view to ensuring that no substances that are currently illegal are being sold. My Department has been in contact with the Attorney General about a range of possible approaches to the matter and a number of issues arising in that context are being considered at senior level within an interdepartmental framework. I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues in vigorously pursuing all viable approaches to counter the potential threats posed by head shops and "legal highs".
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	652	As the Deputy is aware, following on from the recent announcement by the Taoiseach in respect of the restructuring of Departments and agencies, the process of transferring functions and changing Departmental titles is in hand. I understand that the Department of Finance, in consultation with the relevant Departments, will bring proposals in this regard to Government for approval in due course. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that at present it is not possible to provide the detailed information that he has requested in relation to costs that may arise as a result of the decision to change the name of my Department. However, I can confirm that I have directed officials within my Department to ensure that any costs arising in this context be kept at a minimum and met from within existing resources. In this regard, I have instructed that stationery stocks, etc, currently held by my Department be used to the greatest extent feasible, so as to reduce any costs arising.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	653	The Scheme of Community Support for Older People (CSOP) is open and continues to accept applications from local community and voluntary groups. To date, 116 groups have received funding in 2010.  Information on grants paid to groups since 2004 is updated monthly on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.The Deputy will be aware that the CSOP was re-introduced in October 2009 following completion of a review of its operation by my Department. Arrangements for the introduction of a revised scheme — which will address a range of issues raised in the review — are at an advanced stage and I hope to launch it before the end of April. It should be noted, however, that the existing CSOP will remain open until such time as the new arrangements are put in place. Funding of over €4.3 million was provided under the CSOP in 2008 and, notwithstanding the suspension of the scheme for a period last year, €2.1 million was spent on it in 2009. Funding of €3.1 million has been made available in the 2010 Revised Estimates. I am fully committed to maintaining this scheme within the wider context of Government policy aimed at supporting older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.

In particular, it is noted that the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner: this ration will decrease to less than two to one by 2050. Increasing retirement age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings.At present the State Pension is paid at age 66. A minority of people qualify for a State Pension (transition) at 65. From 2014, age 66 will be the standard pension age for everyone. The qualifying age will be increased to 67 years of age in 2021 and 68 in 2028. There will be no exemptions from these new arrangements. People are living longer and healthier lives. With average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 89 years for women and 83 for men. People will still, therefore, be spending at least the same amount of time in retirement as they are today, even with a later retirement age.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 178 together.The recently published National Pensions Framework is the Government's plan for future pension reform. It encompasses all aspects of pensions, from social welfare to private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform. Development of the framework was informed by the range of views raised during the comprehensive consultation process which followed publication of the Green Paper on Pensions. The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State. It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that state support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.At present only 50% of workers have a private pension, with low levels of coverage among moderate to middle incomes a particular concern. While the State Pension is expected to provide sufficient retirement income for the lowest paid workers, most people will have a significant income gap if they do not have some extra private pension provision. Inertia and procrastination are among the main reasons for not taking out a pension.A key element of the framework is the introduction of a new auto-enrolment system which provides a way of overcoming this problem. Employees earning above a certain income threshold will be automatically enrolled into this new scheme, with the employee, their employer and the State all making contributions. Those employees already in a more favourable occupational pension scheme will not be enrolled.For those who are included in the scheme, contributions will only be paid on earnings above a certain minimum level and below a certain maximum. The level of these thresholds will be decided closer to the implementation date and they will be set in such a way as to ensure that the scheme focuses on those on low and middle incomes.Within these thresholds, the employee will pay 4% of their salary, with this being topped up by 2% from their employer and a further 2% by the State. The State's contribution will therefore be equivalent to 33% tax relief. The same 33% State contribution will apply to existing occupational and personal pension schemes and will replace the current system of tax relief at the standard and higher rates. This will represent a major increase in State support for the pensions of lower paid workers.  Employees will be able to opt out of the scheme after a period of 3 months. While they will be automatically re-enrolled every 2 years, they can opt out again if they wish.The limited number and types of funds available under the scheme will be provided by the private sector through a competitive process run by the State. All participating funds will be required to have life-styling built in. Employees will have the option of choosing between these approved funds or providers, otherwise, they will be enrolled into one of the low risk default options. Charges will be kept to a minimum as marketing expenses and investment advice are minimised.In relation to pension charges more generally, the National Pensions Framework commits the Government to introduce regulations to increase the transparency of such charges. This should make it easier for people to compare and contrast the various options available to them in choosing a pension product.A range of legislation will be required in order to implement the various elements of the National Pensions Framework. An implementation group is being established to develop that legislation, as well as the required regulatory and administrative infrastructure. We expect the implementation phase to take three to five years to complete.

A State pension is a very valuable asset and we must ensure that those who benefit from it have made a sustained and adequate contribution over the course of their working life.The Final Report of the National Pensions Board, published in 1993, recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 contributions. The necessary legislation to effect the recommendations of the National Pensions Board was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 (now incorporated in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005) which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from 2012. Details of the proposed increase in the paid contributions required have been included in the Department's standard information material on pensions for some years.It is not possible to determine how many people would qualify for a full contributory state pension in the years in question in advance of pension claims actually being made.  However, the Department has analysed the records of over 16,000 people who qualified for contributory pensions in 2009 to assess how many would not qualify under the new arrangements if implemented at that time. This analysis showed that just under 11 per cent would not have qualified.In addition, a further analysis was carried out on a sample of 2,000 records of those due to reach state pension age in 2012. Approximately 13 per cent of people who would pass the first qualifying condition for a contributory pension today (i.e. have more than 260 paid contributions) would not qualify under the new requirement as they have less than 520 paid contributions. It should be noted that some of this group are still making paid contributions so that the eventual number of non-qualifiers may be lower.  The Department is continuing to analyse the potential impact of this change in qualifying conditions.

The renaming of Sustainable Energy Ireland as the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in the context of recent launch of the Authority's new five year strategy for the period 2010-2015, fully respects for the first time the body's statutory title and remit.  The sustainable energy agenda is pivotal to the Government's energy policy objectives and to the sustainable economic renewal.  It is appropriate and timely to acknowledge SEAI's central role in delivering on our ambitious objectives for energy efficiency, renewable energy, climate change and a de-carbonised energy system.The design of the new brand for SEAI is closely modelled on the old marquee, with the aim of ensuring continuity and minimising costs.  All existing printed materials will continue to be used until stocks are exhausted.  The costs associated with the name change have been kept to an absolute minimum, with the total direct costs of the change amounting to €33,305 inclusive of VAT.  The costs include the design of the revised brand marque and its application to building signage and stationery.  SEAI only engages in advertising in pursuit of specific programme objectives including stimulating programme participation, promoting energy efficiencies awareness or providing technical advice, as distinct from organisational advertising.  No advertising costs as such have been incurred in the name change.

Six exploration wells have been drilled in the area since 1963 and while some natural gas potential was identified, it was not deemed to be commercially viable.  The area is currently unlicensed for petroleum exploration.In recent months, there has been renewed interest in the prospectivity of the North West Carboniferous Basin and last week I announced a licensing competition over the area.

The legislation will amend and consolidate legislation in the area of animal health, particularly to reflect the changed disease status of our animals.  Existing legislation will also be updated to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly.  The Bill will provide any necessary statutory basis to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government that the responsibility for the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) will be consolidated in my Department.I intend to submit the proposed heads of this Bill to the Government at an early date this year.

It is planned that the Bill will be published before the summer recess with the amalgamated body being established in early 2011.2. Abolition of the Educational Disadvantage Committee (EDC) — Drafting of the legislation necessary to effect the abolition of the EDC has been completed and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly. No funds were made available in 2009 or 2010 for the Committee.3. Formal disbandment of the National Adult Learning Council — The Council has now been formally disbanded as part of the Government's programme for the rationalisation of agencies and bodies and the Chairman and  members have been so advised.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	678	As the Deputy is aware, School Transport was approved by Government as a topic for inclusion as part of the 2009-2011 round of Value for Money Reviews.  This review is looking at the original objectives of the scheme, whether these objectives remain valid today, the extent to which the objectives are being achieved, and whether there are possibilities for economies or efficiencies that would improve the value for money of the scheme. In this context, the review is also looking at fundamental issues such as eligibility criteria and catchment boundaries, with a view to achieving efficiencies and value for money in the Scheme.The report of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme is currently being finalised.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	681	Due to industrial action on the part of some staff in the Department of Education and Science, I am not in a position to give full details of the schools referred to by the Deputy.However, as the Deputy will be aware, on 16 February last, my predecessor made an announcement regarding projects to enter architectural planning and to  proceed to tender and construction.A project for the school in question was not included in this announcement.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this projects, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	682	I propose to take Questions Nos.199 and 200 together.The list of all projects currently at tender stage was provided to the Deputy on the 25th of March 2010.There are currently no school building projects which have the necessary statutory approvals in place and have fully completed the tender process, that are awaiting permission to proceed to construction.Subject to the necessary statutory approvals and no issues arising, it is intended that projects will progress to construction as soon as possible following completion of the tender process.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	683	I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 to 205, inclusive, together.Given the changing nature of Irish society and the projected need for a number of post primary schools to open in the medium term, the Department is considering a number of broad policy issues regarding the establishment of new post-primary schools. As part of this, consideration is being given to the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their patronage.  New schools where only very initial planning has taken place will be considered in the context of this framework  when it is established.The second-level school at Clonburris in Lucan is the only such school where a VEC has already been informed about patronage. It is not the case that patronage of this school has been withdrawn from County Dublin VEC rather the position is that the issue will receive further consideration in the light of the new framework. It was anticipated in 2008 that 2 new second level schools would be required in the general Clonburris area in Lucan.  However, given the demographics in relation to the area and the nature of the planning, design and building process, no building has commenced yet and it is likely that only a single school will be needed in the area in the medium term. The consideration of this new framework is not delaying the site acquisition, planning, design and building of second-level schools in any way.In addition to the County Dublin VEC, an application has been made by Educate Together in relation to the proposed new school in Lucan.  Furthermore, a general application in relation to schools in developing areas has also been received from the Loreto Education Trust.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	684	The Student Services Charge is levied by the Higher Education institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services. All students who are eligible under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge. The charge is paid on their behalf by the Local  Authorities or the Vocational Education Committees, in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee grant they are entitled to.The position is that the Higher Education institutions are autonomous institutions and my Department does not have any function in their day to day operational affairs, for which the Governing Bodies and the management staff of the institutions are responsible.  The arrangements for the collection of the charge are a matter for each individual institution and accordingly I do not have a role in this matter. As the Deputy may be aware there is a Student Assistance Fund (SAF) available in the Higher Education institutions. The objective of the SAF is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, because of financial reasons, suffer severe hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies. Applications for funding should be made by the individual student to the Access Officer in their institution. The SAF is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Prelude	686	The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified. Furthermore, schools can make applications at any time with the result that the individual situation of any school can change and allocations are not static. The Deputy may wish to liaise directly with the NCSE in the context of her enquiry.I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and resources will continue to be allocated to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.
