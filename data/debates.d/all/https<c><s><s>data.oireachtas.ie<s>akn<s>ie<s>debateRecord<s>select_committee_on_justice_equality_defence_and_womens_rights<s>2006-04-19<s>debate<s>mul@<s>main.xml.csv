It is proposed that the meeting will continue until 5.30 p.m. with one hour's break for lunch. I propose we adjourn at 1 p.m. until 2 p.m., have a coffee break at approximately 3.30 p.m. and continue to 5.30 p.m. Is that okay?
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I am keen to finish slightly before 5.30 p.m. rather than slightly after it as I have a commitment in west Cork tonight.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	2	We will certainly facilitate the Deputy. I welcome Deputy Howlin, the justice spokesperson for the Labour Party. I also pay tribute to Deputy Costello who, during his time as justice spokesperson, I always found to be the epitome of what an Opposition spokesperson should be. At all times he ensured, in the true democratic parliamentary way, that every amendment was well and truly teased out. All the Bills which came before this committee while he was a member were better as a result of his participation.Deputy Costello also contributed very much to the community policing report, on which he acted as rapporteur. As a result of his contributions, this committee is rightly seen as one of the premier Dáil committees, if not the premier one, in regard to legislation and the work for which it is responsible. I wish Deputy Costello well in his new portfolio in defence and European affairs. I look forward to seeing him at this committee as the defence spokesperson.Deputy Howlin has previously been a member of this committee as his party's justice spokesperson. I am delighted to see him back as spokesperson on justice and I look forward to the same parliamentary tussles as he gave in the past with the object of improving legislation and the other work of the committee.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I would like to be associated with the Chairman's comments regarding Deputies Costello and Howlin. Everything he has said is correct and represents the views of all members of this committee. The enthusiasm that Deputy Costello showed for the justice portfolio has already been mirrored in his role in defence. I have seen him in uniform already.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I endorse the comments of the Chairman and the Minister about our colleague, Deputy Costello. He was an example of a hard-working parliamentarian. He brought considerable insight to his work as his party's spokesperson on justice. He was a credit to his party in the very constructive work he did and in always being ready to bring the Minister to task when necessary. While we miss him, we are fortunate in having a replacement with whom I have worked previously and who will bring his own special insights and experience to the job.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I thank the Chairman for his kind remarks. I look forward to working on the committee. Having served on the committee with the Chairman, I am mindful of his talents, which I greatly appreciate. I am surprised he is still Chairman of the committee and not sitting in the Minister's seat by now. However, such matters are beyond our control. The Chairman certainlymerits promotion.I will need to report to Deputy Cassidy that this is the premier committee. Having worked for some years on the Committee on Enterprise and Small, I was under the impression that Deputy Cassidy felt he chaired the premier committee.I am mindful that the three most senior Fine Gael people on this committee during my four years as a member, former Deputies Jim Higgins, Shatter and Flanagan, and the Fianna Fáil convenor, former Deputy Marian McGennis, all lost their seats. I am mindful that it is possible to spend much time in this bunker under the floors of Leinster House doing important work for the State that might not be appreciated either by those who send us here or by the journalists whose job it is to reflect the work of this committee and all the other committees that work so hard. However, we will do our best.

I fully appreciate the sterling work in this area of my colleague, Deputy Costello. I hope to be able to match his effort.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The original list of amendments and the eight additional lists have been replaced by one composite list of all amendments for ease of reference. I presume everyone has a copy of the composite list dated 19 April.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 64:
After "orally" to insert "by a member of an Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant,".Both my amendments to the amendment are of a technical rather than substantive nature. I ask the Minister and Parliamentary Counsel to consider whether the first of these provides greater clarity. The second amendment to the amendment is purely technical in nature and would ensure the text reads better.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I do not see the reason for a song and dance about the provision allowing for the taking of photographs. Closed circuit television should be fitted in every Garda station and everybody should be on record. Given that the taking of photographs appears to create a civil liberties issue, the protections in the section go as far as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I am ad idem with the Minister on the issue of the photographs and find no reason they should not be taken. Nevertheless, the purpose and requirements of each section should be clear to practitioners and members of the Garda Síochána who refer to the legislation. Members of the public become irritated when those against whom there is considerable evidence of crime are able to resort to technical defences. The purpose of many of the amendments I have tabled is to ensure that gardaí who consult the Bill will be clear about the requirements under which they operate when carrying out their duties under its provisions. This would contribute towards the elimination of technical defences. Members of the public are driven mad when they see individuals walk out of courts on technical grounds when all the evidence points to their guilt.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Now that we live in an era in which most of us carry around a camera phone, I envisage the day when gardaí investigating disorder will, when asking somebody for his name and address, be able to take a photograph of that person so they will know who they are dealing with afterwards. Somehow it will be possible to send this photograph back to base digitally so it might be kept on record. I do not feel this is a major civil liberties issue. However, that is not today's business. It appears we will soon get to the point where every squad car will have a mobile computer that will allow gardaí to communicate directly with their station. The Deputy's proposal seems a tiny bit Victorian or Edwardian.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I will not press the amendments. I merely leave them for further consideration by the Parliamentary Counsel if he or she considers them useful.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I am in agreement with the Minister in that I see no civil liberty issue in the taking of people's photographs. The Chairman will remember there was much debate at this committee on the comprehensive video-taping of all interviews. Approximately 95% or 96% of interviews are recorded at present. Will the Minister correct me if this figure is wrong? It has taken the bones of seven, eight or nine years to get to this level from the position that obtained under older legislation many years ago.I am encouraged by the Minister's reference to technology being available to assist gardaí on the street but I am not encouraged by the pace of real change needed to provide for the assistance and technologies required by gardaí to match the changes of the 21st century.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	18	It states in the legislation that a photograph can be used only in connection with the offence being investigated. Let me be devil's advocate for the civil liberty group and ask what happens if another offence is committed in the future. Can the Garda use the photograph pertaining to the first offence and ask whether people have seen the person depicted? Is there some way in which photographs can be retained?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The provisions of the 1984 Act, to which I take it Deputy Howlin was referring, provide that the photographs must be destroyed within six months. In 1984 the idea of arrest for the purpose of interrogation was regarded as a quantum leap in police powers. I have never been impressed by the idea of the destruction of samples, prints and photographs and I accept that we will need to revisit this issue in the context of the DNA legislation later this year. The US authorities have an elaborate concept of civil liberties and under their system, fingerprints obtained at murder scenes can be compared with those in huge databases, including records of military personnel.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I have no problem with fingerprints or DNA. However, for the Garda to go on a fishing expedition with photographs that may or may not depict the offender just because somebody has in the past committed an offence——
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Arrested for an offence.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Or arrested. DNA is proof in itself and should be held indefinitely, as should fingerprints, but photographs are a different matter.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I thought we were approaching it from a different direction. I thought the Chair was wondering why such a photograph should not be available for identification for something other than the offence.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	24	No. I miss Deputy Costello.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Chairman is a true radical.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Chairman has detected a subtle change already.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I move amendment No. 64a:In page 16, subsection (3), line 7, to delete "is" and substitute "has been".This is another amendment dealing with the historical sense. Grammatically, the use of the expression "has been" is better.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The amendment has already been discussed and will be referred to the Parliamentary Counsel.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I am happy with that.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I move amendment No. 66:
In page 16, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:"(a) in section 3, by the insertion of the following new definition:""photograph" means any image (pixelated or otherwise), photographic negative, fingerprint or palm print, howsoever stored, whether in physical or digital form, from which a specific person can, in any way, be identified;".".This is an amendment to the 1984 Act. Since 1984, advances have been made in many areas, especially photography. Most cameras these days tend to be digital. The definitions contained in the 1984 Act may not encapsulate these modern developments. The amendment will improve the Act by inserting a new definition for photographs. It takes into account advances in the digital photography area.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I appreciate the motive behind Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment. There is, however, a difficulty in that section 6 of the 1984 Act deals separately with photographs, fingerprints and palmprints as separate powers that can be employed against a detained person. In these circumstances, amalgamating the concept of photograph, fingerprints and palmprints would complicate other sections of the 1984 Act. It would fuse two concepts in one area where they are separate in the 1984 legislation. I prefer to consider the amendment further because it requires further amendment of the 1984 Act.I am also not sure about the term "pixelated", as it is written in the amendment.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	32	It refers to the dots that comprise a digital photograph.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I thought it referred to the obscuring of an image, such as a face.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Yes, a series of dots over parts of a photograph.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	35	It has nothing to do with people in hats and the like.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	36	It has nothing to do with fairyland. I take the point made by the Minister. I suppose it shows the difficulty in trying to modernise old legislation. On the basis that it might cause more complications than it would resolve, I withdraw the amendment for the time being.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Amendments Nos. 67 and 68 are related and may be taken together.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I move amendment No. 67:
In page 16, line 17, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following:"(a) in section 6, by the deletion of subsection (4) and substitution with the following:"(4) Any person who—(a) obstructs,(b) attempts to obstruct,(c) fails or refuses to give his or her name and address when demanded to,(d) gives a name or address that is false or misleading to, or(e) fails to obey the reasonable demands of,any member of an Garda Síochána or any other person acting under the powers conferred by subsection (1), shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction—(i) to a fine not exceeding €3,000 or(ii) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or(iii) to both.".".This amendment seeks to ensure that those who refer to legislation have a clear concept of what is involved. The purpose is to adopt the ministerial amendment and strengthen it somewhat in terms of increasing the fine, but mainly to rewrite and re-order and create greater clarity in the layout of the subsection so that it can be clearly understood by anybody who refers to it. It is technical in the sense that it is for clarification rather than providing for any substantive change.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	39	There is a quantum change in amendment No. 68.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	40	That is my amendment.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I notice that amendment No. 68 still refers to punts. It seems odd to be including a punt supplement.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Section 12 (c) refers to €3,000 with regard to a figure of £1,000. That is on line 27 of page 16. We discovered in the meantime that the figure of £1,000 provided for in the 1984 Act had been increased to £1,500, so we are merely being technically correct. We are not using figures in punts, but amending the deleted figure.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	43	That clarifies the matter.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	44	With regard to amendment No. 67, this is a drafting matter. The subsection which it is supposed to get rid of reads as follows:Any person who obstructs or attempts to obstruct any member of the Garda Síochána or any person acting under the powers conferred by subsection (1) or who fails to give his name and address when demanded, or gives a name and address which is false or misleading, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.It is a single paragraph, and Deputy O'Keeffe's draftsman is trying to disaggregate it into a series of subclauses with brackets. On this occasion I prefer the original draft because the alternative proposed looks intimidating, if I may say so. It is a question of drafting style, but we are talking of doing the same thing.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Yes, it is very stylistic. The advice I am given is that this makes it much clearer but I will not push the point. I hope the Parliamentary Counsel is listening to every word and nuance emerging from the committee.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	46	For Deputy Howlin's information, it was generally agreed at the last meeting that there should be consistency through all legislation and a book should set out the precedents agreed.

There are still foreign draftsmen retained as consultants in the Office of the Attorney General. I was loitering in the hall the other day and I noticed that one of them had a nameplate on the door.

All recent legislation includes numbers in numerical rather than word form. It is much more readable but I understand that this is the modern trend in draftsmanship.

In page 16, paragraph (a)(i), after line 44, to insert the following:"(IV) in paragraph (e), by the deletion of “or mouth”.”.My amendments seek to clarify some aspects of section 13 of the Bill, which amends the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990. Work is under way in the Department on the preparation of a Bill to establish a DNA database following the publication of a report on that matter by the Law Reform Commission. The provisions in this Bill are therefore limited to dealing with certain matters needing attention now pending the enactment of the more comprehensive legislation. My proposals in section 13 are designed to update the 1990 legislation to reflect some important developments in DNA sampling. They reflect the position that mouth swabs or plucked hairs will now be sufficient to provide the necessary DNA information in nearly all cases. At this stage, I do not propose any change in the provisions of the 1990 Act on consent. The current provisions are adequate and any proposals for consent should await the new DNA database Bill.Our focus should be facilitating the increased use of DNA sampling. My proposals to reclassify mouth swabs as non-intimate samples will facilitate greater use of DNA sampling, but I do not believe that they impinge unreasonably on rights of privacy or bodily integrity. I am mindful of those rights at all times. However, further restrictions for the purpose of giving consent, by way of new procedures, which would be required by Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment, are not required by the changes introduced in the Bill.Amendment No. 69 proposes the deletion of "or mouth" from section 2(1)(e) of the 1990 Act. This is a consequential amendment arising from the provision in section 13 that mouth swabs become samples which can be taken without the consent required in section 2(4)(b) of the 1990 Act. In other words, the mouth swabs become non-intimate samples. Section 2(1)(e) refers to a footprint or similar impression of any part of a person’s body other than his or her hand or mouth. This is a non-intimate sample. However, the exclusion from its scope of a person’s mouth may point to it being regarded as an intimate sample. To remove that possibility, I am proposing that the words “or mouth” be deleted. A dental impression will continue to be an intimate sample under section 2(1)(d) of the 1990 Act.Amendment No. 70 proposes to insert a new subsection (1A) into section 2 of the 1990 Act to clarify that a reference to the mouth shall be read as a reference to the inside of the mouth. I am concerned that there be no doubt about the obtaining of mouth swabs under the 1990 Act and this amendment will ensure that mouth is interpreted as including not only the opening in the head but also the oral cavity behind it.Amendment No. 71 proposes to delete the reference to cutting hairs in section 13 and simply to refer to plucking hairs as the means by which a hair sample may be taken. The cutting of hair does not produce useful DNA samples for the purpose of DNA profiling. The follicle that is attached to the end of a hair which is plucked is the most useful and interesting area from an analytical perspective and that is why plucking of hairs is being provided for. In addition, this amendment qualifies that hair should be plucked singly in so far as it is reasonably practical, although with someone like me, it might be difficult to find two hairs close to one another anyway. This is intended to cover the situation in which more than one hair is plucked unintentionally. The safeguard that no more hairs should be plucked than the person taking the sample reasonably considers to be necessary for the purpose of forensic testing is restated.Amendments Nos. 70, 71a and 71 b are drafting amendments and deal with the issue of commas.Deputy Ó Snodaigh's proposed amendments, Nos. 72 and 74 and the related amendment No. 292 introduce matters that are far wider than what was intended by section 13. His amendments raise issues that are more appropriate to the new DNA database Bill being prepared and I do not propose to consider those issues at this stage or to accept the amendments.Amendment No. 72 relates to paragraph (c) of section 13, which amends section 5 of the 1990 Act by adding a new paragraph (aa) which lists a number of specific matters about which regulations are to be prepared. The amendment proposes to delete paragraph (aa) and add a new provision that also provides for the making of regulations as to how samples are to be taken. The amendment refers to Schedule 1 which is attached as amendment No. 292. This Schedule includes aspects relating to privacy that one can reasonably be expect to be included. However, the matters included are too general and broad and are closer to guidelines than regulations. Regulations of the type required to govern the taking of samples must be very specific and that is the approach taken in the current paragraph (aa). Furthermore, it is already the case under the Act that any regulations must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The opportunity for scrutiny afforded by that process is a more appropriate way of ensuring the regulations are suitable and pertinent to the circumstances in which samples are taken.Amendment No. 73 proposes to replace "the" with "an" but we have already dealt with that issue. Amendment No. 74 seeks to insert a new paragraph (d) at the end of the section. It deals with the issues to be considered when consent is not forthcoming but the net effect would be to restrict the development of DNA sampling since the superintendent would be required to undertake an extensive review that would be onerous and unnecessary in most cases. It is not appropriate to add such extensive new requirements at this stage. The forthcoming DNA database Bill will provide a more suitable opportunity to deal with the issue of consent and dealing with refusals of consent.In recent times, it has become much easier to take DNA samples. Effectively, an implement similar to a large cotton bud is placed on the inside of the cheek, moved lightly up and down and removed. This produces the best form of DNA sample. Hair samples are very difficult to work with but if a hair is plucked, the small follicle or piece of flesh attached to the end is most useful from the point of view of DNA analysis. The gist of my amendment is to make clear that swabs from the inside of the cheek are to be made the primary means of taking DNA samples in the future.

A number of the amendments I have proposed are technical and stylistic and have been put forward purely for consideration. Accordingly, I will focus on an amendment of substance, namely amendment 71c dealing with the length of time samples can be kept. Under the present legislation samples may be kept for six months, and the Minister is proposing to increase that to 12 months. Is that an adequate amount of time for the retention of samples? My amendment proposes that the time specified in section 13 be three years.

First, it will provide evidence in court where charges are preferred. Second, where an investigation takes a long time, it will provide part of the armoury of evidence being assembled which may in time connect with other evidence. In connection with the latter, I am keen to ensure that samples continue to be available until either a trial is completed and an appeal disposed of or an investigation is fully and finally completed. There may be existing provisions to cover the points I am raising.

Section 4(5) of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 provides that:If a court is satisfied, on an application being made to it by or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the person from whom the sample was taken, that there is good reason why records and samples to which this section applies should not be destroyed under this section, it may make an order authorising the retention of such records and samples for such purpose or period as it may direct.

Samples seem to be taken properly and in a private manner and the present guidelines seem to be satisfactory, notwithstanding that civil liberties groups will call for further safeguards. I have no great sympathy for Saddam Hussein but those with an instinct for fair play felt it was inappropriate and constituted improper procedure to show pictures around the world of him grimacing as samples were taken.With regard to samples which are properly taken and retained, we should ensure that they are retained for a sufficient length of time to allow a criminal trial to be completed properly. We must allow them to be retained while a complex investigation can be under way. I suggest we provide for retention for three years rather than the ministerial suggestion of 12 months. There is a strong case for this.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	71	This is an important area and the Minister has indicated that he will come back with more comprehensive legislation. I presume this is a holding position. I wish to raise three issues on the matter, partly because I am familiarising myself with an area that I have left behind for some time. People are genuinely concerned about forensic evidence being gathered and we need a clear view of how it is done. I would like the Minister to respond to some queries, and I hope I am not diverting the committee from proceeding very quickly with the significant amount of work it must do.Will the Minister précis the procedure for the safeguards which exist regarding the taking of samples? He is now suggesting that mouth swabs would not be an intimate forensic procedure. What are the procedures to take mouth swabs, assuming that this legislative change is made? What would be the consequence of somebody refusing to allow a swab to be taken, and what degree of compulsion is currently permitted and would be permitted by the change in the titling of a mouth swab as a non-intimate procedure?My second question refers to the timeframe issue raised by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. The Minister suggests that these samples could be kept for 12 months, but at an earlier time he suggested that he saw no reason that they could not be kept permanently. What is the Minister's thinking on this, and will a different timeframe be stipulated in the next legislation to be tabled by the Minister before the end of the year?There is a degree of concern about the storage of such samples. I have no knowledge of forensics but if we are to have longer terms of storage beyond six months, what are the mechanisms, procedures and security involved? What will preserve the integrity of the samples and ensure there is no tampering? Evidence, even of a physical nature, has been known to evaporate in recent times from Garda custody.

I have some sympathy with what the Minister is trying to do. He is trying to ensure that investigations and prosecutions are not affected by a restriction that would allow samples to be destroyed after six months. He is also attempting to ensure that the Garda can get such samples when required. Anybody who has watched television in recent years will know from some programmes where science has got us, and in some ways its usage is spectacular.We must try to ensure the Garda has all necessary resources. When the committee last met, the Minister referred to the new forensic laboratory to be built at Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park. We must also ensure when giving additional powers to the Garda that the potential for abuse is minimised. In this regard the regulations the Minister hopes to produce should be included in primary legislation rather than being made afterwards. When the establishment of a Garda reserve was under discussion this committee asked that the proposed regulations be put in primary legislation. We are now hearing the row that is occurring. It is bad policy not to have protections in place prior to the coming into force of an Act. The purpose of my amendments Nos. 74 and 292 is to balance adequately the public interest in obtaining evidence with the necessity to safeguard the right of individuals to respect for their physical integrity and private life.The Irish Council for Civil Liberties went slightly further than what I have proposed. I might re-examine its submission. It proposed that the taking of bodily samples should be video-recorded since the facility will be available in all Garda stations in the near future. That would give protection both to the gardaí engaged in taking samples and also to the suspects, and would guard against the use of undue or unnecessary force and the possibility of a complaint being made afterwards. Guidelines and regulations should be quite clear on the circumstances in which a garda may resort to taking an intimate sample without somebody's consent, and whether it is good enough that a garda should decide to do so in the event that consent is withheld or should have to apply to the Judiciary for an order that the sample be taken, in which case the garda would have to justify the taking of a sample by force if necessary. We do not want to create a situation in which gardaí would be involved in brute force or in pressurising suspects. We do not want a recurrence of what happened in Donegal.Rather than trying to restrict what the Minister has set out, my amendments seek to improve the Bill and to safeguard not only the rights of individuals but also the people administering the procedures outlined by the Minister. I hope they can be taken on board either in this form or in some other form to ensure that protections are put in place at the earliest possible stage rather than later, as often happens.The Minister is planning a DNA database Bill in the future. It is a pity that even the heads of that Bill are not before us as they would provide us with a greater understanding of how it would implement the safeguards that I and others seek, and with a written assurance regarding such safeguards. In the absence of that, we should ensure that safeguards are put in place.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I thank the Deputies for their remarks. There are a number of issues. Deputy Howlin asked for my general opinion regarding DNA and the current law on it. It is a very complex area. Appended to the Law Reform Commission's report on the establishment of a DNA database is draft legislation for the establishment of such a database. When the Law Reform Commission report was published, there was considerable debate on it. Some people strongly believe there should be a universal database, that everybody should be on a system and, therefore, this business of arresting people and taking samples from them in police stations, etc. should be slowly got rid of. There is the other view that it is a huge intrusion on somebody's privacy and dignity and that it should be restricted to the greatest possible extent. In its recommendations, the Law Reform Commission tries to navigate a middle course between the two.I believe the 1990 legislation was based on a Private Members' Bill by the former Deputy, Alan Shatter, or at least he raised the matter at one stage. The problem with all this is that we must philosophically work out our problems with the creation of DNA databases. If one is worried that Big Brother could, with a super computer, screen half the population and identify all the people liable to get prostate cancer, breast cancer and diabetes or who have genetic faults and so on, I can see there is a type of philosophical dimension to it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	77	There is a significant insurance dimension.

In regard to criminal investigations, one of the issues is whether gardaí will arrest people so they can build up a DNA database and whether they will use a flimsy pretext to bring somebody in to take a sample. Gardaí could say they now have Michael McDowell's sample and if there are any more burglaries for which they suspect him, they will have a comparator in the station. It is a question of whether they will abuse their power to conduct sweeping arrests to constantly accumulate DNA data which they can use later.The Law Reform Commission suggested certain samples should be retained indefinitely on the database, that is, those of people convicted of arrestable offences or other serious offences, and that there should be a periodic clean-out of records on people arrested and acquitted. I know the Human Rights Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have a view. I would not see it as a huge intrusion on my privacy to know that in Rathmines Garda station or in the Phoenix Park there was a DNA record belonging to me. In other words, if my blood was found at the scene of a rape, by running a search the Garda could pick me out as the most likely culprit. I do not have a major problem with that. I believe I still have some liberal fibres left in my body but I do not see that my life would be unutterably altered if there were a DNA database in the Phoenix Park with my sample in it. I have no particular concern.

We have insufficient public debate on the investigative side. The capability exists in Britain whereby DNA samples could be taken from the table around which we sit now to ascertain who was in the room. People driving getaway cars or handling anything at a scene of a crime leave traces of DNA. Even though those trace elements of DNA cannot reliably be used in prosecutions, as it could not be proved that the sample was not smudged on from something else, it gives the Garda a very valuable lead.

Regardless of what a judge believes is fair or the Supreme Court might determine to be fair or reliable, the immense advantage to the Garda of having a good DNA capability to give hints as to whom it should be seeking seems to be forgotten in much of the discussion. In that context, if we allow samples to be taken from arrested persons, it could be suggested that the Garda would use a pretext to pick up everybody, whose samples it wanted to have on the database and effectively get them registered in the knowledge that if such a person committed a burglary, he or she could be found quite quickly.

If one takes a glass in one's hand, one leaves a fingerprint and DNA on it. In the mid-1980s and 1990s people were accused of lifting fingerprints on Sellotape and moving them to the scene of a crime. While this was a possibility, one could definitely move DNA to wherever one wanted to place it. There is a danger of over-reliance on DNA because a bad-minded investigator could decide to find some of Michael McDowell's DNA at the scene of a crime and act on it.

If that is the evil we are trying to avoid and it occurs to a bad-minded detective to find a sample of a person's DNA at the scene of a crime, unless it is being suggested that he or she would take something from the centrally held sample and place it at the scene of a crime, he or she could easily do this by shifting available DNA samples to the scene. If blood, hair samples or swabs are kept in proper custody, how would the bad-minded person get a sample to plant at the scene of a crime? The difficulty of obtaining a sample of a person in custody would not be a safeguard against such a person simply waiting until he observed a person using a cup, taking a swab and smearing it at the scene of a crime.

If we provide a balanced package, based on the Law Reform Commission's recommendations, which is sufficient to operate a proper DNA database, affords proper forensic science capacity to deal with it and establishes an oversight body, people would be much more easy about whether compulsory power should be used and about the consequences of not giving a sample.

In page 18, subsection (1), line 15, after "statement" to insert the following:"contained in the book of evidence served on that person".Section 15 deals with the admissibility of witness statements. The amendment in Deputy Costello's name which I am absorbing into my own list of amendments seeks to deal with the procedures involved in such admissibility. Amendment No. 75 sets out to ensure that witness statements that are admitted under section 15 are not produced out of the blue, that is, that they are included in the book of evidence. I presume that is intended so that there is no ambush of any side in court proceedings. Amendment No. 76 is a drafting amendment to make it clear that the leave of the court is required for the operation of section 15 and for the production and admissibility of such witness statements.

I am not sure if it is helpful to include technical amendments with impactive amendments. The alternative is to disaggregate and take each amendment individually.

My amendments to amendment No. 77 deal with the issue of what will satisfy the court in respect of the admissibility of certain witness statements. In the Bill as drafted, there are a number of requirements which are in addition to one another, meaning that they are cumulative. I suggest that we examine an approach which would allow the admissibility of certain witness statements when the court is satisfied of certain things in the alternative. That is the purpose behind that particular amendment.

The issue is where the statement may be so admitted in certain circumstances. I want the statement to be admissible in as many instances as possible.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	176	The common law position is that a prior inconsistent statement is admissible to discredit a witness in a later statement to court, but is not admissible as proof of the contents of the prior inconsistent statement. A person may state to the Garda that he or she saw Joe Bloggs stab Josephine Bloggs on the street, but then might reverse that statement in court. One can use the first statement to discredit the later testimony but one cannot use it as evidence that Mr. Joe Bloggs stabbed Ms Josephine Bloggs on the street. Most lay people would find that difficult to understand but the only evidence that is admissible in a court case is that which is presented in court and subject to cross-examination. If a prior statement is lying on a desk somewhere or residing in somebody's memory, it is not admissible in evidence because, in effect, it is a form of hearsay evidence which is not as testable as the direct testimony of a person in court. When people refuse to give evidence, deny they made the prior inconsistent statement or give wholly inconsistent evidence before a jury, lay people looking at such situations would believe they are hearing a pack of lies. However, it is not sufficient to say it is a pack of lies, retire the witness from the witness box and threaten him or her with perjury prosecution at a later date if it is the case that the testimony is vital in the administration of public justice. A majority of the Canadian Supreme Court decided, in the case of R v. B, that a previous statement can be admitted if it would otherwise be admissible as the witness’s oral evidence and if the judge is satisfied that indicia of reliability are present and genuine.

In other words, there is no doubt that the statement was made. The judge must also be satisfied under Canadian law that the statement was made voluntarily and that there were no factors operating which would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It must be clear that the witness was not cajoled into making a statement or told that he or she would not be released before giving a certain account of events.In coming to its conclusion, the Canadian court was very careful to ensure that a witness could be subject to contemporaneous cross-examination from the defence and that is crucial. One cannot simply proffer a piece of paper without the person who made the statement attending court or being cross-examined on the evidence.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	182	If the witness asserts that what he or she said to the Garda on a previous occasion was a pack of lies and what he or she is saying now is the truth, under oath, the jury must make up its mind on that matter. However, the jury can accept the earlier version if it appears to be more likely than the later testimony. That is the change that happened in Canada.In Ireland, we were faced with a number of high profile cases where people seemed to have given the Garda very detailed accounts, in witness statements, of murders but trials were collapsing when amnesia was suddenly striking the witnesses with regard to why they made the original statements. They simply said that they could not remember anything. They could not remember why they made the statements or what had happened. The question that arose in that context was what we could do about such situations. These events were roughly contemporaneous with the emergence of this criminal justice legislation.That is the background to the proposal that the Canadian law be transposed in statute form into Irish law. The preconditions for its coming into effect are that the witness, although available for cross-examination, refuses to give evidence, denies making a statement or gives evidence which is wholly and materially inconsistent with it. The prior statement is admissible if the witness confirms, or if it is proved, that he or she made it. The court must be satisfied that direct oral evidence of any fact mentioned in the statement would be admissible in the proceedings.Looking at that precondition I see a problem to which I will return. A statement could contain a little inadmissible and a lot of admissible evidence, so we might re-examine that. Another precondition is that the statement was made voluntarily, it was reliable and was given under oath or affirmation, and contains a statutory declaration by the witness that the statement is true to the best of his or her knowledge or belief, or the court is otherwise satisfied that when the statement was made, the witness understood the requirement to tell the truth.

If they say in court that they cannot remember it, the prosecution will cross-examine them. They will say that because there is a record of their statements, it is pointless to put pressure on them to recant their evidence. That is one perspective.

It is either intimidation or threats. If a star witness comes forward and gardaí believe the accused is likely to resort to intimidation when the testimony comes forward, the gardaí can record that evidence in a manner that makes it clear that it is a voluntary statement and that the witness is not inventing it, and they can have it available for use at a later point. The Canadian judiciary decided it would be grotesque if people could recant cast-iron statements and enter a state of amnesia and that if their later statements could be proven fraudulent, no reliance could be put on their original statements.

Will the Minister tell us what the Canadians' experience has been of the provision they introduced? Is there a rough equivalence on constitutional issues between the Canadian and Irish situations?

Canada is a common law jurisdiction with a written constitution, a judiciary having the same functions as the Irish judiciary and a criminal justice system that is based on the same principles. Canadian cases are frequently relied on in Irish courts, so it is not an alien system.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	195	To put it bluntly, has this provision worked in Canada?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I have not studied the consequences. However the British Criminal Justice Act 2003 brought similar provisions into UK law. In section 119 of their 2003 Act, it is stated:If in criminal proceedings a person gives oral evidence and—(a) he admits making a previous inconsistent statement, or(b) a previous inconsistent statement made by him is proved by section 3, 4 or 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865 (c. 18),the statement is admissible as evidence of any matter stated of which oral evidence by him would be admissible.The 1865 Act deals with hostile witnesses, and I learned it in King's Inns. It is still in operation as law in Ireland. The British have moved in this direction.I do not see all the safeguards however that are in our version or the Canadian decision. The British change in law is a bit more terse than ours. We should be clear that the danger would be that the Garda or persons in authority would put people under pressure to give a false account. The person, having thought the matter over, may want to recant evidence. The false account would nonetheless be shoved before a jury even though nobody would be stating that it is the truth. This may happen because it may bolster a case. We cannot walk away from that danger. The alternative is that people can be pressurised into abandoning their testimony to produce miscarriages of justice.I may have been a bit unfair with regard to the British legislation. Section 120 of that Act states:A previous statement by the witness is admissible as evidence of any matter stated of which oral evidence by him would be admissible, if—(a) any of the following three conditions is satisfied, and(b) while giving evidence the witness indicates that to the best of his belief he made the statement, and that to the best of his belief it states the truth.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I share Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's view that this is a very important issue to get right. I am not convinced that the actual formulation proposed by the Minister will make a great deal of difference in a court case. The hurdles are very high. Having been rather directly involved in matters where people made false confessions for actions of which they were innocent, and been aware of them, I am mindful of the safeguards we must apply.My instinct in bringing this to the attention of the Minister regards the subsection (2)(c) provisions where a statement is given under oath or affirmation or the court is satisfied that the witness understood the requirement to tell the truth. How can it be proved that the witness understood the requirement to tell the truth?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	198	We are proposing to give it a second paragraph.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	199	That is true. It would be a difficult issue to deal with in court. Is the simplest way to deal with this matter to present the court with a video of the original statement rather than discussing witness statements? All witness statements should be video-taped, and the degree of truthfulness can be left to the court to determine to some extent.

One is considering this being put before a judge. For example, a person giving a deposition under oath would be presumed to be telling the truth. I am slightly concerned about the formulation of subsection (2)(b)(i), and this occurred to me only now as I read it out. It is provided in subsection (2)(b)(i) that direct oral evidence of any fact mentioned in it would be admissible in the proceedings. Witnesses frequently make 100 admissible statements but include one bit of hearsay. According to this, if that happened the whole statement would fall; every single comma and jot of it would have to be admissible.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Any single fact.

I do not believe that is what is meant. Nor is it intended that every fact must be reliable. I believe it is taking a middle course, namely, that any fact that the prosecution wants to establish from it is truthful. That is what is really there. For example, if one made a long three-page statement and halfway through it one stated that one's mother told one that she also saw the same person do X or Y, that would not be admissible in evidence. If the words "any fact" were intended to be interpreted as meaning "every fact", the statement would collapse. If interpreted as Deputy O'Keeffe suggested and one said something happened on a Thursday, the whole thing would become admissible because we can all agree that the crime was committed on a Thursday. That would be nonsensical. It must be interpreted as meaning a fact——

We are all trying to get a wording that is cast-iron. The Minister's amendment would require that a statement be given on oath or affirmation or contain a statutory declaration by the witness. Let us examine the practicality. An oath or affirmation would have to be sworn before a commissioner for oaths. A statutory declaration would have to be sworn before a peace commissioner. Let us say the statement is properly taken, that it is voluntary and is video recorded at some hour in the middle of the night, would the detective sergeant then have to look for a commissioner to comply with the Minister's amendment? Is that practical and necessary?

It is not to be presumed the prosecution knows somebody will recant. It would produce a book of evidence in the ordinary way. It will not produce a book of evidence and say that because it believes Michael McDowell, as a witness, is windy, it will have a special annex, or a whole set of material attached to the book of evidence anticipating somebody will threaten to break his legs.

However, the original statement is in the book of evidence and it would be relied on by the prosecution and the defence would have sight of it. In other words, one is not talking about somebody who has been brought in, from whom a statement has been taken and who has subsequently recanted it.

The book of evidence is not always simply the raw statements of witnesses. As the Deputy knows, they are edited and the inadmissible and prejudicial parts are taken out. If one is preparing a book of evidence say in a murder case, one does not include a statement stating "I am sure it was Joe Bloggs. I saw him on the last occasion he murdered somebody". One would not include that in a book of evidence because it would not be evidence one would propose to tender in the trial as it would prejudice the jury. Likewise, if there is a large amount of hearsay in somebody's original statement, it is taken out when preparing the book of evidence because it is not evidence one proposes to tender to the jury.I have seen the Northern Ireland equivalent to books of evidence. They have witness statements designed for use in court and are signed with a declaration that their contents are true. Where we would hand over an edited statement, they are handed over as part of the prosecution process.

In page 19, subsection (3)(b), line 2, after “whether” to insert the following:"by reason of the circumstances in which it was made,".Having regard to a recommendation of the Human Rights Commission, I propose amendment No. 78, the effect of which is that the court, in deciding the reliability of a statement that was neither sworn on oath nor video-recorded, should only have discretion to consider whether the circumstances in which the prior statement was made provide sufficient guarantees of its reliability. The wording of the Bill at present could be interpreted as giving the court the discretion to consider whether other evidence available at the trial supports the finding that the statement is reliable. This amendment has been proposed in response to an observation made by the Human Rights Commission.

The subsection provides that statements shall not be admitted if their admission would be unfair to the accused or to any of the accused if there is more than one person on trial. Will the draftsman consider that it appears that a statement will not be admitted where there are joint accused in the event that it may be unfair to admit a statement against one person but not unfair to admit it against the second accused? Is it wise to provide that the person against whom it would not be unfair to have a statement admitted benefits from the fact that its admission could be unfair to another accused person? Does this provide an unnecessary loophole for persons against whom the admission of a statement would not be unfair?

Judges frequently state that one must consider the guilt or innocence of each accused separately and determine if there is evidence against each of them. It may well be that the draftsman arrived at a view that one could admit a statement against one person but it may contain something gravely prejudicial to another person and, therefore, should not be admitted. I will think about the capacity to delete portions of a statement which would be unfair to someone.

In such circumstances, one would need to be in a position to excise. My officials draw my attention to the definition of the word "statement", as provided in section 14:"statement" means a statement the making of which is duly proved and includes—(a) any representation of fact, whether in words or otherwise,(b) a statement which has been videorecorded or audiorecorded, and(c) part of a statement;It is possible that this definition is sufficient to allow excising of material and that the words providing that one can admit a statement mean that one can admit part of a statement in those circumstances. I will examine the matter before Report Stage to ensure this is a satisfactory way to deal with the issues we have uncovered.

They may recant statements at a later stage because they were not advised or made a wrong assumption. The entire section has major problems.

We cannot directly transpose the Canadian model here because Canada has a different history, albeit a similar legal structure. I understand, for example, that witness statements are routinely video-taped in Canada. I am not sure whether witnesses making statements are encouraged to have counsel present. This could make many of the problems with which we are dealing much easier to address in that counsel could advise a person not to state or include certain information in the knowledge that it would be prejudicial or ruled out of order. We had this debate last year when discussing the criminal justice system, statements and organised gangs — we will return to these issues — and I do not believe the extent of the problem at that time justified such a major change in our legal system.Although the Minister is taking on board one of the human rights concerns, there are quite a number of others he should bear in mind. Some groups are worried that he is removing the right of the accused to cross-examine witnesses in cases where they would be available, although they might not necessarily be willing to be cross-examined. One should not forget the accused may face quite a long prison sentence in cases where this provision would be used.In the past, suspects in particular have been coerced into making statements and there have been quite high-profile cases in this regard over the years. They recanted, were frowned upon and found guilty and it was only in later years that their statements——

There is no question of a prior inconsistent statement being produced and the person not being subject to cross-examination by the accused on the truth of it.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	292	My worry, if we go down this road relates to perhaps not making it a condition that the statements be video-taped. At least on video-tape there is the possibility of looking at somebody's demeanour when making a statement and it could be taken into account when weighing up the evidence on cross-examination.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I am sympathetic to the Deputy regarding the general principle. If somebody has made a statement that he or she is now repudiating, most juries would like to know exactly the circumstances in which that statement was made. A statement in the handwriting of a garda, with the person's signature at the bottom, is not a very satisfactory document to put in the scales if the person says he does not know why his name appears thereon because he does not believe it to be true. Normally in such circumstances, a jury would refer to what it hears in court at the time in question.We are really dealing with a variation of the common law rule against the admission of prior inconsistent statements as evidence of their own facts. Our present system constitutes a problem for us and I want to be sure that the remedy is not defective or producing worse problems in the other direction.

Possibly as a result of such extreme action, the witness in question would not be available for cross-examination. Have I expressed myself too bluntly?

It refers to a new approach, giving peace commissioners powers regarding statutory declarations and refers to the powers of a commissioner for oaths regarding the taking of a statement under oath. It is a major enough step.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The idea of having a commissioner for oaths to administer an oath or peace commissioner to administer a statutory declaration is entirely nullified by this provision. The notion of the statutory declaration is of no consequence when a garda becomes the administrator of the oath. In the short period I had in which to read the Bill, I did not notice this. It is a significant move on which I would not be keen. It deals with the difficulty pointed out by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe to the effect that one might not be able to get somebody to administer an oath in the middle of an interrogation in the middle of the night, for example. It totally undermines the principle of having an externally appointed person, under the seal of the Minister, authorised to administer oaths. Any garda is suddenly deemed to have the power. What is the point of this provision?

The facility to video-record a statement on a matter under investigation would speed up the process and ensure the existence of a proper record. When a garda is taking a statement, one has to pause while he or she is catching up, thereby breaking one's flow of thought. Is it possible to reconsider the section such that the rights of the witness and those of the garda to have the witness's statement video-recorded might be taken into account? That would speed up the process. This may not be the appropriate place.

It might be beneficial in practical terms to hear some words of experience from our colleague. If we are talking of the future, and how we will present witness statements in court, the best facility is video-recording. How does one deal with the issue of a statutory declaration or a sworn affirmation with regard to a video-recording? Would everything said be typed up from the video-recording and then sworn as an affidavit?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	308	That is a good point. One can see why the oath was provided for. Instead of taking and receiving such a statutory declaration the member can take the person's statement on oath or affirmation and may administer an oath or affirmation.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Would that oath or affirmation involve a full transcription of everything said during the video-taped discussion, and would the person sign off on it under oath? I wonder about the practical implications. Deputy Howlin's point must also be considered. A statement made before a member of the Garda and witnessed by the member will generally stand up in court and has due weight accorded to it. Are we doing anything useful by giving another two hats, so to speak, to a member of the Garda, by saying that in the particular circumstances the person has the power of a peace commissioner, or in another circumstance the powers of a commissioner for oaths, and can have statements taken under oath?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	310	Two issues are involved. One would expect that if a witness is being truthful and voluntary, a garda would take note of what that person is saying, and that it would not simply be an interview on a video-recorder, that a conversation about a case where leading questions are being put would not be reduced to a single narrative form. Exchanges such as "Can you remember anything else?" and the reply "No I cannot" would not be stuck in the middle of the proposed statement of evidence in the case. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh noted, if a garda takes a statement, he or she must first note the person's name and then guide the person in terms of subject matter. People do not normally enter a stream of consciousness, saying any old thing that enters their heads.A video-recording would show whether that process is fair, or whether the garda was planting words in the witness's mouth, and whether the statement was reliable. The video-recording would corroborate whether something which is reduced to writing is a reliable account. What is reduced to writing will contain a statutory declaration by the person saying that what he or she said in the statement is true, which binds people to the proposition. A video-recording of a person making such a statement is much more impressive than a signature on a piece of Garda manuscript, as the jury will not be able to figure out from that how the person came to say certain things three months previously when the person is now saying something radically different.

It is not a norm to hand out all the bits of one's investigation to people as one goes along.For the video-taping to work, the process of taking down the statement would have to be video-recorded, and the written document would have to be acknowledged by the person. If the person is in voluntary, truthful humour, he or she would then be asked to sign a statutory declaration that everything said was true. That, combined with a video-recording, would be the optimal way of satisfying a jury that the witness to a murder who is now saying he or she saw nothing, spoke reliable truth when in the Garda station, and that what the person is now saying is not true.

The judge has to rule on admissibility, but it will be like the admissibility of a confession. In the end, the jury will have the function of assessing whether it is credible evidence. The mere fact that a judge says the jury can see a video-recording does not bind a jury to accept it.

There could be a preliminary discussion leading into the formal taking of a statement. A detective would normally have visited witnesses in their houses and have listened to them saying they saw a murder, or whatever. A detective would not normally ask a person to stop and give a written statement, but would want to work out a picture in his or her mind. The detective might then ask for a formal statement to be made in the house or in the Garda station.That is the crucial element. One is visited in one's own home by a detective, and if one makes it an absolute pre-condition that all statements must be video-recorded, one would have to go to where there was a video-recorder, or alternatively, the detective would have to bring a mobile video-recording studio along to one's house. That is another issue one would have to think about.

A witness may make a statutory declaration, assuming one is not at the time suspected by a Garda member of having committed the crime. Will the investigating Garda member not take a statutory declaration from that person if he or she believes the person to be the suspect?

Would a bright lawyer later ask why such a person was not a suspect? The logic would indicate that he may well be a suspect. What is the whole point of the statutory declaration at the end? The idea is that it adds validity to the court by taking it, but since it simply consists of the member wearing a different hat, I do not know if there is any additional weight to it. A normal witness statement signed by a member of the Garda Síochána has significant weight and is reasonable enough in a court of law. This amendment is the same thing dressed up so I am not sure if it would have any greater weight. Is that what the Minister intends?

A statement which has that written on the bottom becomes provable by consent in the absence of a witness if there is no contest on the testimony. A jury can then receive it. It is a fairly formulaic part of taking a witness statement. The person, having set out his testimony, then goes on to declare that what is on the document is true to the best of his knowledge.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	344	It is not such an innovation when one thinks about it. Prior to the Criminal Procedure Act 1967, every indictable offence was on the basis of depositions. A book of evidence was created by a series of depositions. Every witness had to be brought before the district court and deposed on every point of evidence. It was taken down and converted into a text, but it was all done on oath and it constituted perjury to provide evidence through that means for a trial on indictment if it were known not to be true. In the 1967 Act, the idea of assembling sworn testimony before someone was indicted was swept away and a book of evidence, which was just a narrative of what people proposed to say at the trial, was substituted for it. At the beginning people were entitled to go back to the old deposition procedure if they wanted, but that was changed in the case of the State (Sherry) v Wine where people could not be cross-examined. Therefore, this is not a radically different proposition from things that have existed in the past.In one sense, it is in favour of the accused that he or she cannot be put on trial unless people put their heads on the block in respect of the truth of what they have said about the accused. It used to be case that one could never be tried before a jury unless people had sworn the bones of a case against the accused before a District Court judge, who would then send the accused forward for trial.

We should start from the beginning again. There was a situation where one could not be put on trial for a serious offence without sworn testimony already in the bag, which would then have to be repeated at trial. That was swept away and a paper-driven process was put in place of it. Witness statements were put into books of evidence and there was no judicial supervision or formality or oath taken on those. Then, in section 21 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, the needle went back a little with the provision that in certain cases, certain evidence can be admittedif the accused accepts it, provided it includes a declaration by the witness that its contents are true and that the witness knows that he or she is liable to be prosecuted for saying anything known to be false.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I move amendment No. 81:
In page 19, subsection (1), to delete lines 38 to 42 and substitute the following:""competent person" means a person employed by a public authority and includes an immigration officer who is deemed to have been appointed as such an officer under section 3 of the Immigration Act 2004;".The amendments to section 17 insert a revised definition of "competent person" for the purposes of taking other witness statements. This is a technical amendment having regard to the particular manner in which immigration officers and officers of the Revenue Commissioners are appointed or employed. The amendment deletes the reference to an officer of the Revenue Commissioners in the definition of "competent person" because such officers are encompassed in the definition of public authority in paragraph (a). “Immigration officer” is included in the meaning of “competent person” and is deleted from the meaning of public authority. A garda may operate as an immigration officer. He or she is employed as a garda but is appointed as an immigration officer.Amendment No. 84 substitutes "Health Service Executive" for the various health boards and amendment No. 82 relates to the change from "the" to "an" Garda Síochána. As I stated on section 15, these sections are necessary to deal with a real and growing problem. The proposals are reasonable and contain safeguards to ensure that situations where statements are to be admitted are to be regarded as exceptional and require careful scrutiny by the trial court. I should not withdraw my proposals, although Deputy Ó Snodaigh will oppose the section.

The Human Right Commission argued that the statements would have a lower guarantee of trustworthiness than statements made to gardaí. My earlier point was that if a person was making a statement to a HSE employee, the option to ask for it to be videotaped would not exist. I asked that the option be there for witnesses making statements to the Garda. I do not know whether it is reasonable or practical to expect a wide range of statutory bodies to have the capacity to videotape statements. In its submission on this the Human Rights Commission said there was no provision in the Bill to inform a person that his or her statements may be admissible as substantive evidence in a criminal trial. Somebody may make a statement without knowing where it will end up. Its recommendation was that the statements made to competent persons employed by a public authority as defined should not be admitted under any circumstances as evidence of the facts stated therein in the course of a criminal trial, as the circumstances in which such statements are made will not provide a sufficient guarantee that such statements are reliable.We are going further than I believed we would when I initially read the Minister's proposal. We are going further with this than most people would be aware of, and I am concerned about it.

These include immigration officers and harbour and airport police. These people are in a position to take statements. Statements made to such people should not be swept aside as being without value. Deputy Ó Snodaigh has stated that it is very unlikely that a video recording machine would be available to such people, but it should be borne in mind that a court and jury, in the last analysis, decides on the weight to be attached to any prior inconsistent statement proffered in evidence.If a witness wants to repudiate a statement and can do so in any credible way, a judge and jury will be slow to take the prior inconsistent statement as evidence of the truth. This would come about if there was any credible explanation by a person who would disown such a statement. The purpose of this is to give people the opportunity to make a statement which has some solemnity, in order that a case will not occur where people are prosecuted on one basis but the case falls apart afterwards because witnesses disown their statements.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I will try to explain more clearly the problem I have. In local authority housing, for example, if there is a case of anti-social behaviour under the Local Authority Act, an officer from the local authority would clearly be given permission to take a statement. This occurs in any case if there is a dispute between two families. Somebody could make a statement to the officer, and I presume if there was a court hearing afterwards, the statement could be referred to as evidence. Often it has been found that statements have been made in such circumstances specifically because it can undermine a case made by the other neighbour.With regard to what was being discussed earlier, with a statutory declaration the person is informed that giving a false statement is an offence. To give a false statement to a local authority is not an offence, as far as I know. Such a statement could nonetheless be used in a court case. I assume the same is true for some of the other bodies, although with some it may be an offence to give a false statement. In the others, officials will rely on people's good will and their own judgment. Often, especially in local authority estates, the officers cannot find the correct version of events and will issue a warning to both families.To rely on these statements or present them as any type of evidence in a court case goes beyond what we discussed earlier, a witness statement made specifically to the Garda Síochána. The Garda has powers to charge a person in that case if a false statement is made. Immigration officers can be called as witnesses and state that a man or woman made a statement. That would have the same effect as a statement from the particular person being produced, unless the person appears and can be cross-examined.We should be more careful on the issue of taking a statement on its own merit. It must be ensured that the person is told when a statement is being made which could be used in a court case, that to give a false declaration makes that person liable for an offence.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I will examine again the whole of section 17 to see if it is too widely drawn. As we have been debating the point, a particular group has occurred to me which is relevant. If other groups are eligible, investigating officers of the Garda Ombudsman Commission should be eligible under this system as they have powers of arrest. It is strange that this group does not feature among the listed groups. If I come to the conclusion that any of these are unsafe categories to whom to extend the power, I will be happy to delete them.A person has to be sent forward for trial for an arrestable offence, a stipulation contained in section 15 (1). It is not for people parked on double yellow lines or who have held a rowdy party in a house. Such actions are not covered by that. The real issue, which we will review between now and Report Stage, is the circumstance in which a statement is made. For example, the Health Service Executive could comprehend cases of child abuse, and the question that must then be asked is if there would then be adequate safeguards with regard to statements made to social workers. Would these be subject to the discipline of the Garda Síochána, and would it be clear to somebody making a statement to them that the statement would be likely to be used in the trial of an indictable offence per se?That is an issue on which there should be a clear view. If we widen the matter to include a very broad variety of previous inconsistent statements, we must collectively ask ourselves whether somebody making a statement in these circumstances should be warned that he or she is making a witness statement intended for use in the prosecution of a serious arrestable offence. I do not want to cast the net too wide to the extent that internal management inquiries in Aer Lingus might throw up material which could subsequently be relied on in court. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh stated, by definition, such statements will not be video recorded. I want to be careful about that.

It is a difficult Bill with which to deal because each section is virtually a stand-alone section. There are 211 pages of amendments to the Bill.

What is important is that the views raised here are fully considered by the Minister, his officials and the Parliamentary Counsel. I make no bones about it. What I want to see is a decent Bill that will help in the fight against crime. It is of no concern to me which Minister deals with it in the short time available. One way or the other, this will be on the Statute Book in the relatively near future. Let us try to ensure it is as cast-iron as possible.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	459	This provision is related to the revised arrangements under the Criminal Procedure Act 1967. Under the Criminal Procedure Act 1967, a book of evidence had to be considered by a District Court judge and this was revised in the 1999 Criminal Justice Act to allow for somebody to be sent forward for trial by the Circuit Court on a charge. The book of evidence has to be served on the accused before the trial but the District Court sends the accused forward. As a balancing aspect to that, the abolition of the preliminary examination, the accused person was given a right to apply to the Circuit Court — the trial court — to discharge the accused on the basis that there is no adequate case to meet in the documents supplied to him or her. That is part of the streamlining process to get trials on indictment forward to the Circuit Court and to allow that court to rule on the issue as to whether there is a case to meet rather than have a District Court judge do it which was considered to be a lengthy time consuming aspect of the criminal justice system.The compensation for an automatic "send forward", if I may use that phrase, is that the accused person will be given a right to apply to the Circuit Court, the Central Criminal Court or wherever to discharge him or her on the basis that the documents furnished to him or her did not show a  prima facie case on the same basis that there would have been a discharge in the District Court on the book of evidence during the old preliminary examination procedure.The Criminal Justice Act 1999 refers to matters on which oral evidence may be given on an application to discharge. Oral evidence is extended to include evidence given on an audio-visual link or a video-recording of any evidence given through a live television link pursuant to that Part. This section will refer to any video-recording or audio-recording which may be admitted by the trial court as evidence of any facts stated in it. It is an extension of the right to apply for dismissal on the basis that one is entitled to rely on the substance of what is in any video-recording or audio-recording which may be admitted by the trial court as evidence of any fact stated in it.

In page 21, lines 23 to 32, to delete all words from and including "appropriate," in line 23 down to and including "add." in line 32 and substitute "appropriate.".This relates to the reference of a question of law to the Supreme Courts. I wish to amend subsection (2). In the Minister's construction of it, the Director of Public Prosecutions, before referring a matter of law to the Supreme Court, may have consultation with the trial judge. I am advised that is a fraught procedure for a number of reasons. It could be construed as an affront to the court inasmuch as the DPP can proceed regardless of the views of the court. More fundamentally, the DPP, who is part of the criminal proceedings, is not required to consult the defendant as to the contents of the question of law and may well be perceived as going behind the back of the defendant in dealing with such a draft motion. Since the DPP can proceed on his or her own volition, it would preserve the independence of the court system if this reference, which I have no doubt is well intentioned, was deleted.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The purpose of this section is to allow the prosecuting authority in trials on indictment to refer a question of law to the Supreme Court for determination where there has been an acquittal. This is a very important point because at present in a murder case, for instance, a very important ruling on admissibility of evidence on grounds that it was unconstitutionally obtained or otherwise could be given in the course of a trial. While the accused might be acquitted, the State would have this item of law decided by a judge of the High Court, the Circuit Court or another court. If it applied to all cases, it would be regarded as dispositive of the point and there would be no point in bringing similar cases in the future.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	468	There is no argument against the correctness of that procedure. It is a mechanism by which the appeal proceeds. I have no difficulty with the good intention of the Minister in including reference to a trial judge making an application. My advice is that it does damage to the separation and independence of the courts system. The DPP or, if the Attorney General is involved, the prosecuting authority may proceed regardless of the view of the court, which could be seen as a slight on the latter. Since the court should be independent of prosecution and defence even after the conclusion of the case, the requirement for consultation to take place in the absence of consultation with the defendant in the matter seems to go beyond that independence.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	469	The real question is whether we are dealing with a symmetrical situation in respect of the rights of an accused. An accused person has rights, in certain circumstances, to have a point of law decided. In the case of an accused person, the decision relates solely to that accused person and the point of law will either be upheld or not. Where the State, with either the Attorney General or the DPP as prosecutor, wants to refer a general point without prejudice to the acquittal to the courts——

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	472	Where the State loses a case in the High Court and determines that it should be appealed, it does not consult the judge involved.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	473	When fixing a point of law in a case stated, it is quite normal to get the tribunal involved in whether a matter is a point of law. The existing provision in section 34 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 states:(1) Where, on a question of law, a verdict in favour of an accused person is found by direction of the trial judge, the Attorney General may, without prejudice to the verdict in favour of the accused, refer the question of law to the Supreme Court for determination.(2) The statement of the question to be referred to the Supreme Court shall be settled by the Attorney General after consultation with the judge by whom the direction was given and shall include any observations which the judge may wish to add.This covers the case where an accused person is acquitted on a point of law. However, a jury that has listened to the entire case might find an accused person not guilty, for example, on grounds of non-identification. Halfway through such a case a decision may be made on the admissibility of the accused's confession, which does not relate to the identity evidence that is eventually left to the jury to decide upon.This new provision is to address those cases where the acquittal did not directly result from the ruling of law. Where the acquittal directly results from the ruling of law, there is a right to refer the point to the Supreme Court for decision. In a case where a trial continued and the jury acquitted the accused on a totally different issue without hearing the evidence that was the subject of the point of law decision, the DPP or Attorney General may wish to seek clarity on the law. I would take on board Deputy Howlin's point if I were inventing a role for the trial judge de novo. However, section 34 of Criminal Procedure Act 1967 provides that the trial judge be consulted and that he or she is permitted to give his or her observations in support of his or her ruling on the law to the Supreme Court.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	474	Has that provision worked well?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	475	It has worked so far. The provision applies only where the accused is found not guilty effectively by direction. It is proposed to extend the provision to cases where an accused may be found not guilty by decision of a jury but where a very important point of law may arise during the course of the case.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	476	Is it a replication of the 1967 Act, with that change only?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	477	It is a replication of the procedure. The consultation is not something we have only now cooked up. It has always been the case that the prosecutor, in obtaining a reference to the Supreme Court, is obliged to check it with the judge and let him or her make whatever observations he or she wishes on the point of law issue to the Supreme Court for its consideration.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I have listened to a very interesting argument. The overall purpose, in the public interest, is to get a point of law resolved, which requires that the question be put properly. If this provision assists in getting the question put properly, it is in the public interest to follow this process. I will return to the point as to whether the accused should have any role in the matter. We are clearly involving the Supreme Court in making a decision on a point of law in the public interest, which will form a precedent in the future. The more care taken and the more consultation that takes place in having the issues brought fully and properly before the Supreme Court, the better.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I am reasonably convinced by the Minister's argument. My intention was to make the procedure simpler. I did not want to involve the trial judge in a justification of his ruling. The courts stand alone under the Constitution and they make decisions. It is not for the DPP or anybody else to decide to appeal a point of law. What precisely did the Minister mean?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	480	That is not the way it works.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I imagine that is the case. However, I presume a point of law would be sufficiently clear in the judgment for the Supreme Court to make a decision once it is referred. I am giving a straight line for the DPP to go to the Supreme Court on the matter without involving the judge. As one who wishes to preserve the authority of the courts, it seems to me that the DPP will appeal the matter to the Supreme Court and request for justifications on the matter before taking it further. My advice is that this could be perceived as a slight on the court by implying that by taking it to a higher court the right decision can be made. It seems to ask to judge to put his copybook in order so that it can be reviewed.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I concede the point made by the Deputy's advisers. However, I would put the opposite construction on the matter. The provision in the 1967 Act shows respect to the trial judge. One does not wander off to a superior court stating that a trial judge made an incorrect decision for particular reasons. The original trial judge might not have made his decision on that basis.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	483	It happens in every other appeal to the Supreme Court.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	484	It does not in this sense. Under the 1967 Act, where a point was referred, the Supreme Court was obliged to assign counsel to argue in favour of the decision. It was generally regarded that judges should not become parties in litigation but should, in limited circumstances in which their legal rulings are under scrutiny, have an opportunity not to have their decisions misrepresented and, rightly or wrongly, should have an opportunity to state the basis on which they, for example, dismissed a case or ruled a confession inadmissible.If I were a trial judge who had excluded evidence or made a ruling of significance in a court case, I would not feel slighted if the Director of Public Prosecutions were to consult me indicating that he proposed to distil from my judgment a particular question for the Supreme Court and that I would be able to send to the Supreme Court my account of my reasoning on the issue. Rather than having people examine a transcript and state that I was somewhat woolly on this or that point, I would be able to state the reason for my decision on the particular point. Sitting members of the Judiciary would not consider themselves slighted by being given the opportunity to have their say when their legal rulings come under scrutiny. So far, I have not noticed any indication that this is the case.When I served as Attorney General, the question arose as to whether it was right or wrong for a judge whose rulings had been referred to be represented by counsel of his or her choice. The general feeling of the superior courts is that it is better to leave it to the original parties before the judge to argue out the matter and to allow the judge to step back from the arena and not become combative in defence of his or her ruling.Curiously, the provisions in this section are an advance on the 1967 Act, which states simply, as a bare provision, that the Supreme Court shall assign counsel to argue in support of the decision, whereas in this legislation it is proposed that, on a question referred to it, the Supreme Court shall hear argument by, or by counsel on behalf of, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions, as may be appropriate and, if the acquitted person so wishes, by counsel on his or her behalf or, with the leave of the court, by the acquitted person himself or herself. If a very skilled layman handles his or her own case and the court is willing to listen to him or her, he or she would be allowed to present argument to the Supreme Court. In addition, such counsel as may be assigned under subsection (4) may present argument to the Supreme Court.Under subsection (4), the Supreme Court is obliged to assign counsel to argue in support of the decision if the accused person waives his or her right to be represented or heard or if, notwithstanding the fact that the acquitted person exercises his or her right to be represented or heard, the court considers it desirable in the public interest to do so. For example, if the court was of a view that the point was of such fundamental importance that it should not be a matter for a solicitor, who had got his client off on various grounds on an afternoon in a rural Circuit Court, to come up to Dublin to argue the point, it might decide that the matter warranted the appointment of a separate team of counsel.To return to Deputy Howlin's original point, this provision is not a slight on nor an interference with the independence or status of the Judiciary. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe will probably recall similar instances to those I encountered in my own practice, for example, when one asked a judge to state a case or appealed by way of case stated from the District Court or appeal commissioners on income tax, one always submitted one's proposed case stated to the judge who could then direct that it had no bearing on the matter which arose in the first instance.

The section, as framed, imposes a requirement on the DPP to include any observations the judge may wish to add. I have in mind circumstances in which a paper is sent to a judge who indicates that he has observations to make but then-——

This appears to go against the grain in that an accused person in a case must obtain leave of the court to make representations. I accept, nevertheless, that the person in question will have been acquitted and will have only an academic interest in the point of law being argued before the Supreme Court.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	492	Why is my amendment No. 92 an alternative to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment, particularly as they appear to be identical?

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	494	My amendment makes the same point. In subsection (3)(b), if the acquitted person so wishes, the Supreme Court may hear from counsel on his or her behalf or, with the leave of the court, by the acquitted person himself or herself. Given that an automatic right to counsel is provided, it is improper that the leave of court is required before an individual can address the Supreme Court. As far as I am advised, an individual has had a right since ancient times to represent himself or herself if he or she so chooses. It is improper to give counsel a right which is not given to an individual.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	495	Let us examine the position. The accused person has been acquitted and is a free man and is out of the woods in respect of the charge in question. He could opt to defend himself, either in the court below or that above, if he had a live, personal interest in the matter. Subsections (6), (7), (8) and (9) give an extensive legal aid function to the courts to assist a person who is in this position. Let us imagine that a person's counsel has argued for days on particular a point and he is then acquitted of that count but convicted on three others and sentenced to 20 years in Mountjoy Prison. He may say that he will have his day in court and that he is going there to argue the legalities of this point. At that stage, the court must surely say that it is a net legal point and that the person may or may not be suitable to argue it — some would be suitable and others would not. Having somebody who could not follow the point at all contributing to an argument at great length might be entirely futile if a general point of public law were being considered.All we are doing is giving the court a right, in certain circumstances, to claim that the point is fairly obtuse and that it will make lawyers available to the person in question if he wants to have his say in the matter. The lawyers could be chosen by the person in question from the entire legal aid panel. I am sure the court would apply this principle fairly. The court would say that since the person is acquitted, it is not necessary to hear his personal observations regarding the state of the law.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	496	So speaks a distinguished lawyer. What will laymen know about such matters? There is a right to individual representation and, in this regard, one should bear in mind the consequences of saying that a person's lawyer has an automatic right when he or she does not. It does damage to a principle that the aforementioned difficult cases, which I believe would be few and far between, would not justify. The tedium involved in somebody doing exactly as the Minister described would be so rare that it could be tolerated. Other tedious affairs are endured by courts and I would prefer to preserve the principle that an individual has a right to represent himself or herself. I do not see it happening.

It is not as if I am introducing a new principle. Rather, it could be argued that I am going in the opposite direction to the one that might be apparent. We are providing for the right of an accused person, with the permission of the court, to be heard and also for a legal aid system for such persons.

However, we are talking about people acquitted in the courts. The outcome is not really of any personal interest to them and, therefore, the absolute right to appear in court may not be as strong as it would be if there were adverse consequences for them.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I move amendment No. 94:
In page 23, before section 21, to insert the following new section:"21.—The provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 transferring the criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court shall come into operation upon the passing of this Act.".The purpose of the amendment is to insert a new section to bring into effect the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995. I claim some responsibility for that legislation. It was the product of an agreement on the appointment of High Court judges during the collapse of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Government in the 1990s. A sub-committee of the then Cabinet brought forward a compromise that we thought would last but this did not prove to be the case.One of the provisions of that Act, which has remained on the Statute Book since its enactment nine years ago without ever having been brought into effect, was to abolish to Court of Criminal Appeal and to transfer its jurisdiction in criminal matters to the Supreme Court. It was felt at the time that this would be an improvement in criminal law because it would, for the first time, give the Supreme Court, which has the finest judicial brains in the country and an enormous wealth of experience, general jurisdiction to deal with criminal appeals. The current scope of the Supreme Court in such matters is very limited, with the only cases referred to it by the Court of Criminal Appeal itself, coming within its purview. The commencement of the 1995 Act would have significant benefits for defendants because it would ensure they get a full hearing before the highest court in the land and one which has an extraordinary wealth of experience, rather than being dealt with, as now, by the Court of Criminal Appeal at a final level.I am always concerned with regard to legislation, for example, the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, when there are important principled decisions taken by the Oireachtas that are enacted but never brought into effect. I am further concerned that any Minister or any Executive would be able simply to decide not to have regard for an enactment of the Oireachtas. If legislation is not going to be put into effect, it should be repealed rather than ignored.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	522	On Deputy Howlin's last point, I would be inclined to repeal the legislation. There is a danger of overload on the Supreme Court. Life is becoming more complex and the Supreme Court should be left to deal with points of law, constitutional matters and enormously important cases. There is probably a case for some form of a permanent Court of Criminal Appeal which would be the last and final court on criminal matters, other than on points of public importance and law.I would be more inclined to the view that it would be best to repeal the provision in the 1995 Act transferring the criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court and replace it, if necessary, with some form of permanent Court of Criminal Appeal which would be the final arbiter in criminal matters, other than on points of law.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	523	The notion that there should be an appeal to the Supreme Court from the Circuit Court, the Special Criminal Court and the High Court when it is in the guise of the Central Criminal Court was contemplated in the mid-1990s, as Deputy Howlin has said. The Supreme Court was expanded to deal with such a contingency so that there would be eight judges of the Supreme Court, which would permit it to sit in a five-person and three-person configuration simultaneously. When I came into office I was concerned about this issue and then the Fennelly report on the criminal justice system was published in 2003. Mr. Justice Fennelly chaired the Courts Service working group which published that report and did not propose to abolish the Court of Criminal Appeal.More recently, I have heard some murmurings that some members of the Judiciary favour a Court of Civil Appeal so that run-of-the-mill cases do not get to Supreme Court level.

In that way, an argument over some point of law, for example, in a judicial review in the High Court, would not require a Supreme Court decision. The question arises as to whether we go down the route proposed by Deputy Howlin or that proposed by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, namely, that it might be better to unclog the Supreme Court and go down the latter——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Or expand it.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	527	The choice is either to expand it or put in an intermediate layer. I am a touch agnostic on this subject because I can see the merit in both arguments. The Fennelly report is being considered in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is a very challenging report in some respects because it deals with a number of issues, such as entitlement to jury trial and the distribution of criminal work between the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Court.One of the points presented in the programme for Government was the possibility of establishing a National Criminal Court so there would not be delays and rape and other cases could be transferred from experienced Circuit Court judges to experienced High Court judges to get the work done more quickly. That proposal was a creature of its time because there was a perception that there was an enormous delay in moving on serious cases in the Central Criminal Court. As I understand it, there has been a very considerable improvement in the Central Criminal Court and it is much more up to date in its work now than it was when those various proposals were being discussed.Mr. Justice Fennelly's report is very detailed. While trying to understand how his proposals would work in practice I had difficulty with the proposition that the Circuit Court could have jurisdiction in murder and rape cases alongside the Central Criminal Court. This gives rise to the problem of working out an allocation mechanism for that kind of work. What Circuit Court judge, in Wexford or Galway or anywhere else, would willingly take on a murder case if the consequence was that it would involve a three-week wipe-out of a lot of the court's other civil work? That is a serious issue on which I have not come to any conclusions. The Department is studying it at present. This is one of those issues that one can approach in a reformist frame of mind only to find there are more complications involved in changing the situation than leaving it as is.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to the question of making the Court of Criminal Appeal a permanent court. At the moment, that court normally consists of a Supreme Court judge accompanied by two High Court judges and——

How long, for example, should somebody serve on a semi-permanent basis on the Court of Criminal Appeal? Would it be one law term, a year or what period? Would continuity be enhanced by any lesser period of service? Would it be appropriate to put people to exclusively criminal work for an entire year? These are issues on which I want to consult as widely as possible, rather than impose my own view. Without being unduly deferential, the Judiciary is in a better position to judge which approach is better than those of us at a distance. The argument for continuity is based on more consistency in sentencing and such matters. There are arguments against continuity so I want to consult widely and to afford the Judiciary the opportunity to make its views known before a decision is made.

The current situation is unsatisfactory and we need a sense of where it is leading. The Oireachtas had a settled view, although it may now be a dated view, that the Supreme Court should be expanded to deal with appeals. It is the highest court in the land and it is where the buck stops. Its members are supposed to be the brightest and the best and the Minister will no doubt end up there sooner rather than later. If that was felt by the Oireachtas to be the best course of action then, we should implement it. If it was not, then we should do something different. I am concerned from a legislative perspective that when the Oireachtas determines law and structure, it should not be thwarted by inaction. We should implement what the Oireachtas decided or put forward an alternative.I concede that the administration of justice has become even more complicated in the past decade. The views of specialist courts are now trotted out regularly in areas of sexual abuse, company law and corporate crime. It is becoming so complicated that new structures are needed. Just as the Criminal Assets Bureau was needed to bring together talent that was not necessarily available to law enforcement, it might be necessary to consider new structures for the court system. There is no better person to do that than the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I hope we will see some movement from him in that regard. In the interim, I am not so wedded to the 1995 Act that I would divide the select committee by insisting on its implementation. From a legislative perspective it is not satisfactory to enact law and then ignore it.

In page 23, line 14, after "Court" to insert "or the Supreme Court".I do not intend to labour this point but I suggest, as an interim measure pending the enactment of the 1995 provision for the Supreme Court to be the appellate court in criminal matters, that it be entitled to give leave to appeal to itself in criminal matters. At present if the Court of Criminal Appeal refuses leave to appeal, that is the end of the matter for a defendant. The Supreme Court should have the right to grant leave, in certain circumstances, to hear appeals if it determines the matter to be sufficiently important.

The amendment refers to subsection (2) and proposes that the words "or the Supreme Court" be added, which would provide that an appeal lies from the Court of Criminal Appeal or from the Supreme Court to the Supreme Court if the Supreme Court certifies that a point of law of exceptional public importance is involved. It appears that the amendment proposes that the Supreme Court would be asked, in effect, to certify its own decisions.

That is to misunderstand the amendment.  According to section 29(2) the Court of Appeal can now simply shut off the avenue of appeal.  What we are saying is that a case can be made on a point of law to the Supreme Court, in the same way that a case can be made for judicial review to the High Court, and the supreme Court can decide to hear it.

Therefore, it is not necessary in this circumstance to provide for the Supreme Court to certify directly for its own consideration that a point of law of exceptional public importance is involved. A person can appeal the refusal. It would be unusual, even on an interim basis, to provide that a court could certify something and then facilitate an appeal against its own certification.

It is a point of law rather than a general appeal. The confusion comes from the reference to "that Court", which refers to the Court of Criminal Appeal in the way the subsection is laid out.

If I am allowed, I will speak on it. From a procedural point of view, it appears that the Director of Public Prosecutions can give a certificate of leave of appeal to himself, but it seems a meaningless procedure to require the DPP to have leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The DPP gives leave to appeal to himself in the current formulation. It would be more honest to give the DPP a free right to appeal to the Supreme Court without having to get leave to appeal. This relates to subsection (3).

He cannot just say that he would like an appeal on a certain point which is not all that important because there is public dissatisfaction.  At least the DPP would be forced to stipulate the point of exceptional public importance and pin the colours to the mast. The DPP could then give reasons and it would not be a result of him being annoyed by a decision. He could certify the question.

Perhaps the Minister would outline its purpose.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	591	Its purpose is to provide a mechanism by which the time available under section 2(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 in which to decide whether to appeal an unduly lenient sentence may be extended. The existing time limit is 28 days. However, it has often been the experience of the Director of Public Prosecutions that the transcript of a trial is not available within that time limit. The Director of Public Prosecutions must effectively rely on counsel's observations and on informal descriptions of what transpired. The view of the Director of Public Prosecutions is that it would be of great assistance to him to be in a position to have the transcript available to him before he appeals a sentence.This measure is not to provide for a bare extension of the time to 56 days, rather it is simply to provide that in cases where he wants the time to be extended to 56 days, he can apply to the court within the 28-day period to extend the time limit. Therefore, the amendment is not simply to provide for a doubling of the period but to provide for circumstances where the Director of Public Prosecutions can make a case for giving himself a little more time to consider appealing a sentence.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	592	In light of the circumstances outlined, I withdraw my opposition to the section. While I am not noted for having much sympathy for those involved in and convicted of having committed crime, it can be a little unfair on such offenders to have the question of an appeal on the leniency of a sentence hanging over them for too long a period. I accept the case made by the Minister of the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions, especially regarding the transcript of a trial not being available within the time limit.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	593	I wish to make a brief observation and, prior to doing so, signal that it is probably not in order for me to do so. One of the issues that causes great aggravation is the period between decisions of the High Court and the perfection of those decisions, which can extend to many months. I do not know whether a view has been taken that there should be a timeframe or at least an examination of the support mechanisms because the current process is clogging up the appellate system where the perfected judgment, in many civil cases in particular, takes months on end to present, and the clock does not start ticking until the perfected judgment arrives. I make that observation on tightening up the timeframes involved.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I hear what the Deputy says but I am disappointed if that is the case. Usually perfected orders should be capable of being drafted by the side who wants to rely on them either for the purpose of appeal or for the purpose of setting the time running against an appeal. It is a matter on which I will confer with the Courts Service.

In page 25, subsection (1), line 14, to delete "tried on indictment" and substitute "who has been tried on indictment,".This amendment relates to the style of language used. Returning to the point on the use of plain English, in this section we are dealing with a person who has been tried on indictment. That is the language people would normally use in such circumstances. I suggest we do likewise in this section. It is a stylistic point for referral to the Parliamentary Counsel.

Perhaps the Minister would outline his thinking behind this provision. It is unusual for such an order for costs to be made. In many instances legal aid is provided for those appearing before our criminal courts. I am not sure of the percentage of cases involving an order for costs or whether it is only in the case of particular circumstances arising that the court would make an order for costs against the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. If such an order for costs arising is unusual, why are we providing for such an appeal against an order and why are we extending the time for the taking of such an appeal? The Minister might outline his view on this section.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	603	As the Deputy said, it is true that the great majority of indictable crime cases are dealt with on legal aid and, therefore, the question of costs does not normally arise. However, where it does arise, it is only fair that the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General, as the case may be, should have the right to appeal it if he or she considers that the costs have been unfairly awarded against him or her. Since costs are normally a discretionary matter and since generally in criminal matters the courts have been very sparing in awarding costs either way, it seems it is not unfair to give the Director of Public Prosecutions a right to be heard by an appellate body on the rare occasions when costs are awarded and in the rare subset of those rare occasions when he thinks an injustice has been done to him.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I was not even aware that a person could get an order for costs against the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General in a criminal trial. This arises rarely and only where the person tried on indictment is acquitted and in the rare case where the judge is of the view that costs should be awarded. If we are trying to ensure our criminal justice system is fair, is it fair to introduce a provision where an appeal can be brought against such an order?Furthermore, we are extending the time for bringing such an appeal. Many of us are keen that the criminal law should be as tight and as tough as possible in regard to those who commit crime but, notwithstanding that, we do not want to go overboard, especially in a case where a person is acquitted. Surely, the objective should be to try to ensure that such acquittal will arise, as far as possible, on the merits of the case in order that we will remove technical defences as far as possible. Where such an acquittal arises, surely our objective should be to try to ensure that the person charged and so acquitted is put in the position in which the person was prior to being charged. What is proposed goes a little against the grain from the point of view of fair play.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	605	I disagree with the logic of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's position on this matter. Assuming a person, whose financial means are such that he or she would not qualify for legal aid, is prosecuted, acquitted and the trial judge, who has possession of all the facts, is minded to award costs, what possible justice is there in asking an appellate court to sift through all the issues again to determine whether costs should be awarded? It is a mechanism that would clog up the system unnecessarily and would probably cost more in legal time and costs than would possibly be saved in cases where a reversal of the costs order might be made. It appears to be extremely parsimonious without bringing much benefit to the Exchequer in the long term. Where there is an acquittal and where the award of costs is made by the trial judge, who is certainly the best person to know all the facts and who has been present for the entire discussion, why would that be second guessed by an appellate authority? It is not normal.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	618	Not at all. He is saying that the person got off and he will appeal the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal or to the Supreme Court. The person got off and there is no reason that an award of costs should be added to this. It is not normal to award costs in a criminal acquittal. It is, therefore, a jurisdiction which, in my experience, is very sparingly applied. On the other hand, if costs are awarded on a solicitor and client basis, a huge sum of money could be awarded in favour of somebody. In those circumstances, the Director of Public Prosecutions should have a right to have somebody review that decision if he thinks it was unfairly invoked against him.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	619	We are focusing on penalising criminals, and rightly so. However, in this case we are discussing somebody who has been acquitted and it is a question of who will pay the huge sum of money. The trial judge believes it should be paid by the State. If it is not paid by the State, it must be paid by the person who, in law and possibly in fact, is innocent. Just because they have means above the limit for qualifying for legal aid does not mean that they are disgustingly wealthy. This burden of costs could be an enormous penalty for them. We have heard regularly about people who have been unfairly prosecuted or unfairly pursued. We should not go overboard. If somebody is acquitted, let us ensure, in so far as we can in framing the law, they are not acquitted on a technical basis. If, subsequently, they are acquitted on the merits, we should not go overboard in penalising them unduly.

If somebody is not found guilty of the crime, one cannot punish them through a secondary means. Certainly, one cannot punish him simply because he is over the means threshold for free legal aid. That would clearly be unconstitutional because he would be in a different category simply as a result of his means.

The great majority of people who were acquitted were never, therefore, awarded their costs. That was the practice. If the Deputies are saying that costs should follow the event in criminal cases generally——

However, if one were to bring into the criminal sphere the notion that costs would follow the event and if one is interested in equity, the State should be able to recover the costs against the accused where somebody is convicted of a serious offence.

My point is that in exceptional cases where costs are awarded, there must be a proper legal ground for this. If it is a proper and reasonable decision, the Court of Criminal Appeal will in all probability not reverse it. Where the Court of Criminal Appeal believes that it is not a reasonable decision, the Director of Public Prosecutions is entitled to some remedy rather than simply being obliged to pay up and not argue the decision.

Inequity arises where, in the rarest and exceptional circumstances, the trial judge feels compelled to make an order for costs and leaves it open to appeal. However, I do not feel strongly enough about it to go to the wall on it and I will not press my opposition further. Perhaps between now and Report Stage, the Minister will make inquiries in this regard. I had never heard of such a case. How often do these cases arise?

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I move amendment No. 101:
In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"PART 5AMENDMENT OF FIREARMS ACTS24.—In this Part "Principal Act" means the Firearms Act 1925.".Both amendments provide for the insertion of new definitions in section 1 of the Firearms Act 1925. Amendment No. 102 provides in some cases for the insertion of additional definitions in section 1(1) and, in others, for the substitution of other definitions. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has tabled a number of amendments to my amendment, which propose the deletion of section 1(1), which provides for definitions, and its replacement with a new consolidated definitions subsection. He proposes the deletion of the definitions under the 1925 Act and their reinstatement together with new definitions I propose to insert. While I understand the Deputy's wish to have a consolidated set of definitions for all the Firearms Acts, the difficulty with this approach is a number of the definitions under the 1925 Act, which he proposes to delete and reinstate, have been substantially amended in subsequent firearms legislation. For example, the definition of "firearm" in the 1925 Act was substantially extended over the years, particularly under the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990, to include a range of weapons, including stun guns, crossbows and so on. The Deputy's proposal would reinstate the older definition and, thus, exclude weapons that have been included under amending legislation and different statutes over the years.The consolidation of all the definitions in the Firearms Acts would require substantial amendment to seven Acts between 1925 and 2000 and, therefore, the approach I have taken is to amend existing definitions where they can be readily consolidated. In this regard, having examined the Deputy's amendments carefully and consulted the Parliamentary Counsel, I am satisfied the consolidation of the definition of "ammunition" proposed by the Deputy would not, unlike the "firearms" definition, have implications for other Firearms Acts. While I am opposed to the overall thrust of his amendments because of their implications for the other Firearms Acts, I am prepared to accept his consolidated definition of "ammunition" and I propose to table on Report Stage an amended definition of "ammunition" along the lines of his definition. The problem with his amendment is it is not complete. While I want to accept it, I cannot do so because it still leaves problems. However, his definition is preferable and I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to take account of the point he has made.The Deputy has suggested the deletion of the words "word and expression" where they occur in the definitions. I consulted the Parliamentary Counsel on the matter, who advised that the words should not be deleted. It is a question of style, although I have a great deal of sympathy for his point because it is simple repetition. If he pushed me on it, I would take them out.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	650	I would very much like the Minister to introduce a new consolidated firearms Bill, which would update all legislation in this area since 1925 and include the Minister's new proposals, most of which I am in sympathy with, but my concern is that we are completing another addition to a patchwork quilt and we will make it more difficult for anybody who wishes to get up to speed on the Firearms Acts. It is important from the point of view of criminal law that people should know and be able to find out where they stand.That is even more important in the context of firearms because of the significant number of legally held firearms in the State. It is important that a distinction should be made between law abiding people who are entitled to bear arms to shoot game and so on and criminals. We are mixing and matching the criminal and legal elements. Approximately 170,000 shotguns are legally held, although I am not sure that means 170,000 individuals hold guns, as some individuals may own a number of shotguns. The number of licence holders, therefore, may be much lower.Other firearms are held legally, for example, for participation in a number of sports such as clay pigeon shooting. When I raised that as my starting point on Second Stage, the Minister's reaction was that there would not be sufficient time to introduce separate legislation. Were such a point made now, it might have some validity but my original remarks were made in February 2005, which is well over a year ago. As we are where we are, my approach now is to introduce amendments to ensure that this part of the Bill is simple, straightforward, clear-cut and understandable. While I have no great difficulty with the Minister's amendment, questions arise on certain specific issues. I am not sure if one is to measure muzzle energy in joules or how one would count the joules at the muzzle of a gun. Those are things we should understand before adding them willy-nilly to our legislation.My other amendments are stylistic and aimed at ensuring the finished product is as understandable as possible to those who wish to know where they stand under the law. The Minister is virtually inviting me to press him on some of these amendments and I will do so with some diffidence. While I do not have the perfect answer, my view and the views of those who have advised me are reflected in the amendments and I put them forward in the genuine spirit of creating the best possible product.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	651	I preface my remarks by saying that I come late to the minutiae of the debate. While it is not only important for us to amend the law but to do so in a rational manner, we have grafted on all sorts of different component parts to the legislation in an unprecedented way. We all aspire to the creation of consolidated legislation and even the most complicated financial Acts are being consolidated currently. I strongly share the view that the regime governing the legal and illegal holding of firearms must be clarified in one consolidated Act. The Minister will gain significant support for such legislation across all benches and will have a fair wind behind him to get the Bill through the Houses very quickly. While I am not suggesting there will be any obstruction to the measures before us, we must be aware of the need for clarity in the law. I share Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's view and would have preferred a number of separate Bills on judicial reform, criminal reform and firearms rather than the hybrid before us here. However, we have no option but to proceed with the Bill as drafted and, as such, we will deal with the minutiae of the Minister's proposals as they arise. I have no view on the definitions set out and can only assume the Parliamentary Counsel is best placed to advise us.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	652	The Firearms Acts are a mixed set of statutes which set out civil and criminal functions. They deal with whether a youngster can have an air rifle or a farmer a shotgun and provide for the circumstances in which a licence for such weapons may be granted. These are primarily civil matters and they do not give rise to significant criminal issues. The statutes also cover the offence of possession of firearms with intent to endanger life, which is a grave criminal matter. It is peculiar to have such a code and is analogous to circumstances in which the Road Traffic Acts, for example, contained provisions setting out the offence of using a car for an armed robbery. In such circumstances, the statutes would cover everything from insurance to very serious criminal offences. The problem with the Firearms Acts is that they constitute a mixed civil and criminal bag. If I had the opportunity and felt there was sufficient parliamentary time available over the remaining period in office of the current Government to introduce a comprehensive firearms Bill to consolidate firearms law, I would have gone down that road. However, I found I could not.For reasons that are well known to members, I had to amend the Firearms Acts to help the Garda to carry out its criminal functions. I also found that there was cross-over between civil and criminal matters as firearms were being stolen from people who held them lawfully and used in criminal activity. We face emerging case law problems on the issue of whether it is permissible for a superintendent to refuse to grant a licence on the ground that an applicant does not have adequate firearms lockers or safes at home. Having found that I had to amend the Firearms Acts in the interests of the fight against crime, I found there were other provisions in the existing legislation which were simply unfair. The gun lobby has sought reform of the circumstances in which guns may be held and, as the responsible Minister, I did not want to tell them they had to wait for a further statute for civil reforms due to criminal law priorities. Gun owners would have felt I was putting them at the end of the queue despite their urgent requests for modernisation of the law.Under the Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002, all of the Firearms Acts are capable of being restated as a series of Acts in consolidated form. I intend to have the Department prepare a restatement of the Acts to ensure they are easy to follow. The amendments must fit into place to allow a person to pick up the text and easily understand the law.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-19 00:00:00	Prelude	654	It is a physical job, but once it is done it can be handed to the Attorney General for certification as a restatement. The restatement can be used in court as a consolidation. I would prefer to adopt a consolidation approach and tackle every issue, but I could not tell the Garda that sawn-off shotguns would have to await a further debate on gun safes, muzzle velocity and restricted firearms. The Garda would have told me it could not wait. If I had said to the firearms lobby that it would have to wait because I was dealing with Garda matters only and had no interest in the civil issues, I would have been stuck with the problem of whether or not the adequacy of firearms safes was a civil or criminal law matter. Inelegant as the solution is, I have decided to do as much work as I can in one part of the Bill. The restatement to be published hereafter will address any confusion. It will be to everyone's advantage to be able to identify the law in one set of Acts through what I hope will be a simple text.The terms set out in the definitions section such as "ammunition", "commission" and "expression", represent one style of drafting. If it pleases people, I am happy to accept their amendments. It makes no difference to the price of eggs if we amend the Bill this way or not, but I am not obstinate and will accept the amendments to make people happy.
