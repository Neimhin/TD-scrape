#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	2	That was the Labour Party's idea.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	3	We agreed the Order of Business last Thursday.  The arrangements for today were agreed by the House last Thursday and we are proceeding on that basis.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	4	You agreed differently.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	5	According to Standing Orders, you, a Cheann Comhairle, are the person who has discretion in this matter, to allow Leaders' Questions or not.  Standing Orders specifically state that, at the commencement of public business on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the Ceann Comhairle may permit, at his or her discretion, a brief question not exceeding two minutes from each leader in Opposition to the Taoiseach about a matter of topical public importance and in respect of which certain arrangements shall apply.A Cheann Comhairle, I challenge your interpretation that we agreed this approach last week.  We did not agree this last week, and there was a vote on it.  The impact of that vote was that there is no Leaders' Questions, no oral questions, no Order of Business, no Adjournment Debate, no votes and no accountability to the Dáil by the Government.  You are aware, a Cheann Comhairle, that Article 28.4.1° of the Constitution requires that the Government be accountable to Dáil Éireann.  How is the Government being accountable to Dáil Éireann today?I challenge your interpretation, a Cheann Comhairle, on a number of grounds.  In previous times when a Deputy was suspended, the first item on the agenda for the following day's business or the following week's business was a vote to remove the Deputy in question.  You suspended Deputy Bernard Durkan last week.  There is no vote on his suspension, as was always the case in accordance with precedent.  The motion that was rammed through last week specifically in respect of Standing Order 27 allows at your discretion the taking of Leaders' Questions in the House today.  I put it to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that you should use your discretion because since we met in the House last week with some acrimony, things have happened in this country that are of the most serious and sensitive import that require your discretion to allow Leaders' Questions today.   I want to be able to ask the Taoiseach about the number now on the live register, which demonstrates the unemployment rate has risen to a record level.  I want to ask the Taoiseach why, on the Friday of a bank holiday weekend, the Health Service Executive released figures to the effect that 188 children died while in the care of this State.  The Ceann Comhairle, with his discretion, knows this is a matter of most serious importance.  It is even more significant than one might imagine considering that we heard two mothers speak on national radio stations today and yesterday about their children, who are alive, healthy and well — thanks be to God——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	6	With all due respect——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Those children would not have been born had their parents followed the instructions given to them under the system of the Health Service Executive set up by the Minister for Health and Children.  Can anybody understand the depth of feeling of mothers who have had miscarriages where misdiagnoses occurred?  I want to ask the Taoiseach about that matter.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	8	There is no provision for that today.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I know that.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I have no intention of engaging in any histrionics about this; it is a matter of the most serious import.  The Tánaiste may smile about it if she wishes.  The point is that, in the past few minutes, we have seen the publication of two banking reports.  I have not had time to read them yet but if the significant statement issued by Mr. Casey, the former chief executive of Irish Life & Permanent, is anything to go by——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Some co-operation with the Chair would not go amiss.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	17	——there are very serious matters that will have to be discussed.My point concerns the Ceann Comhairle's interpretation of Standing Order 27, the Standing Order that allows Leaders' Questions at his discretion.  Surely the Ceann Comhairle must believe the issues I have raised are of such importance that Members of this House, who are elected by all the people, should be able to discuss them in the Chamber today and tomorrow, rather than having a situation whereby the House is spancelled and strangled by a vote taken last week.  I urge the Ceann Comhairle to examine his interpretation of Standing Order 27.  It is within his discretion to allow accountability, as allowed for in Bunreacht na hÉireann in Article 28.4.1°, which states the Government must be accountable to this Dáil.These are matters about which the entire country is now talking and by which it is affected.  We in this House are denied the opportunity, today and tomorrow, to say anything about them.  It makes a mockery of democracy, which is fragile, and speaks a tonne for the way the Government views the public and the issues that affect our nation.I understand the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children responsible for children has a difficult task and I know the importance of the Ryan report and the statements thereon.  Consequently, I do not wish any Member not to be able to speak about these matters in the House.  It is very important that the broader issues——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	18	We need to move on with today's business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	19	——that we must talk about be debated in the House.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I wish to deal with two points the Deputy has raised.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I will not argue with the Ceann Comhairle.  I contest his interpretation of Standing Order 27.  It is entirely within his discretion to allow brief questions from each leader of a party in opposition on matters of national importance.  These are matters of national importance and the Ceann Comhairle, as Chairman of this Assembly, should see to it that he uses his discretion to allow us to ask questions of the Government about matters which even Government members know are so important.  One should bear in mind the telephone calls and anxiety of mothers around the country who have gone through——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Deputy is holding up the statements.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	23	——what was gone through by those two good mothers whose children would not be with them today, happy and healthy, but for their maternal instincts.  This is not a matter for semantics or for quibbles about Standing Orders.  The Ceann Comhairle has the authority under Standing Orders to allow Leaders' Questions, to change the Order of Business to allow for these matters to be discussed in this House.  This is the Chair's duty and responsibility.  If the Government has not got the courage to talk about the issues, answer the questions and display some sense of responsibility and accountability, it proves that it looks at this House as a charade, a whitewash and a veneer.  That is not the way politics should be.  Whomever we represent, whatever party or none, we should at least be able to speak about the issues of the day and to seek responsibility and accountability from those who are privileged to hold this league of office.I contest the Ceann Comhairle's interpretation and ask him to respond to the issues I am raising in the spirit in which I am raising them and to allow for discussions and a change in the business designated last week so the House can discuss these matters today.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Chair does not have any discretion; the Government proposes and the House disposes.  On the second point, Deputy Durkan was not suspended from the House last week, he was asked to leave the House and he graciously acceded.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	25	That is not true.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I have ruled on the matter and if Deputy Kenny, or any other Member of the House wishes to challenge that ruling, he must do so by way of a substantive motion on the floor of the House.  There is no other way.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	27	That is contrary to Standing Order 27, which states: "At the commencement of Public Business on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the Ceann Comhairle may permit, at his or her discretion, a brief question not exceeding two minutes from each Leader in Opposition to the Taoiseach about a matter of topical public importance".  When the Taoiseach voted here last week to strangle today's business, he walked out of the chamber and turned his back on the Dáil and the people.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Last Thursday the Dáil passed a motion, which the Labour Party opposed, dealing with the business for this week.  That motion did not exclude the hearing of Leaders' Questions today.  There was no reference in the motion to Standing Order 27, the Standing order that deals with Leaders' Question.  That Standing Order was not stood down by the motion put by the Government and passed last week.In anticipation that I would wish to raise some issues on Leaders' Questions today, issues that have arisen since last Thursday, such as the revelation that 187 children had died in State care in the past decade, the shocking disclosures about the reliability of scans conducted on pregnant women in a number of hospitals, the two banking reports that have been issued by the Government and about which the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will hold a press conference at 4.30 p.m., the claims made about the role of the regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance in an affadavit sworn by the former CEO of Irish Life and Permanent, and the effective hijacking in international waters by Israeli forces of an Irish-owned vessel, MV Rachel Corrie.The Labour Party Whip, Deputy Stagg, wrote to the Ceann Comhairle yesterday, drawing attention to the fact that the motion on Thursday did not preclude Leaders' Questions.  The Ceann Comhairle replied, noting that the motion that was passed on Thursday stated that oral questions shall not be taken.  The Ceann Comhairle stated in his letter that this encompasses all questions, including Special Notice Questions under Standing Order 33 and Leaders' Questions under Standing Order 27, neither of which is specifically mentioned by reference to their Standing Order reference number.  A Cheann Comhairle, when you make rulings, you normally draw our attention to precedent and rely on precedent in making rulings.  I want to draw your attention to precedent for the ordering of business and motions dealing with the ordering of business.  I have found four precedents that I wish to draw to the attention of the Ceann Comhairle, where motions deal with the Order of Business for particular days and where business is being stood down.  In each of these precedents, it states that oral questions shall not be taken on that day but it also states there will be no Leaders' Questions on those days.  I draw the attention of the Ceann Comhairle to the motion passed on 23 March, which set down business for the day, stating that "oral questions shall not be taken today" and in a separate item that "there shall be no Leaders' Questions today" pursuant to Standing Order 27.  On 14 December 2006 another precedent was set where it says that oral and written questions shall not be taken and in a separate item on that motion it says there shall be no Leaders' Questions pursuant to Standing Order 26A, as it was then.  On 29 September 2004, the Dáil agreed "oral questions shall not be taken today" and a separate item states " there shall be no Leaders' Questions today pursuant to Standing Order 26A".  On 8 April 2004, similarly, separate provisions were made in a motion so that oral questions were not taken and that there were to be no Leaders' Questions.  The precedent of rulings of the Chair and the precedent of the House is that where it is intended Leaders' Questions will not be taken, specific provision is made in the motion to that effect.  There was no specific provision made in the motion passed by the House on Thursday which I submit, a Cheann Comhairle, you are bound by.  That motion does not preclude a hearing of Leaders' Questions and does not stand down the Standing Order dealing with Leaders' Questions, as happened in the past.  Therefore, Standing Order 27 applies to today's business and Leaders' Questions should be taken today.I wish to raise a leader's question with the Taoiseach in respect of one the matters I referred to earlier.  No decision was taken by this House not to have Leaders' Questions today.  If the Ceann Comhairle decides and interprets the decision of last Thursday to mean there should be no Leaders' Questions, he is setting a precedent that will seriously disadvantage non-Government Members of this House and the Opposition parties.  It will be a precedent I and the Labour Party find unacceptable.  A Cheann Comhairle, having drawn your attention to what was in the motion last week and the precedent of this House, I ask you to reconsider your position on the taking of Leaders' Questions and to agree to take Leaders' Questions as I believe you are required to do under Standing Order 27 and the terms of the motion passed last Thursday.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	29	We considered the correspondence from the Labour Party Whip, Deputy Emmet Stagg, and the reply was clear and cogent.  It was not open to misinterpretation.  It sets out the position and the basis for our decision on this matter.  We do not have provision for Question Time of any kind today.

Those were his own words.  We have presented a substantial motion in regard to a revised ordering of business for today and tomorrow that will double the time for address of the Ryan report.  Two hours for that debate is absolutely unacceptable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Hear, hear.

There are many Deputies on all sides of the Chamber who want to contribute on this very important issue but who will not be able to do so because of the restrictive provision of two hours for the debate.  We have also provided in the proposal we have put to the Chair for address of the two banking reports.  That is not to exclude any of the other matters that were indicated for address over the course of this day and a half.Second, the motion presented by the Government last Thursday provided that the business should be ordered in a certain way "unless the Dáil should otherwise order".  This is further affirmation of the point we understood that the Ceann Comhairle was sharing with us last Thursday that the ordering could be changed.  That is what we on the Opposition benches are seeking to do with the facilitation and co-operation of the Chair, in line with what he already said was possible.We seek these changes against the backdrop of everything that has unfolded since we left the Chamber last week.  This includes the absolutely dreadful situation that was exposed in regard to prenatal scans for women in early pregnancy and the fact that we only know of two or more cases at this point; heaven knows how many women will emerge in the coming days who have been through that most dreadful experience and all that flows from that in terms of confidence——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	37	There is no provision to venture into these areas at this point in time.

We wish to address urgent, important, emergency issues.  We had a clear indication that if matters of such import were to present that we could indeed address them.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I seek the Deputy's co-operation with the Chair.  Let us move on to the business as agreed last week.

This was indicated at the Whips' meeting as something that could be done in the event of a critical, emergency issue presenting.  For women the length and breadth of this State, the revelation so bravely brought to public attention by the Redmond family certainly merits address in this House today and tomorrow.There is also the situation where we have had Irish citizens hijacked at sea by the so-called Israeli defence forces — hardly defence forces in this particular instance.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue of grave importance to the House and the country, that is, the implementation of the recommendations of the Ryan report.  I do not believe anyone in the House will forget the day on which the Ryan report was launched in May of last year and the shock it brought to everyone, including families, neighbourhoods, communities, the Government and all political parties.I was tasked by the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Brian Cowen, to prepare an implementation plan that would effectively respond to the issues raised by the Ryan report.  Everyone is aware that in recent weeks and months the issues of child protection and child welfare have been to the forefront of public debate and it is appropriate that we take several hours to hold a discussion about how we will react to the Ryan report today.  In particular, we must consider the various policy documents that have been already prepared.  All NGOs that have spoken about this issue in the past few weeks and months have acknowledged that the right policies are in place.  Our greatest challenge is to put those policies into action and to do so in a uniform way throughout the country.Members should recall the building blocks to which we have referred and what we hope to put in place to ensure a child protection and welfare service in this country which is the envy of any country in the world.  In particular, I refer to the PA Consulting report.  This was commissioned by the HSE and finalised last October.  It provides a roadmap for better management of HSE child protection services.  Even the staunchest defender of the HSE would not deny that deficits exist which must be addressed in terms of management and a uniform delivery of services within the HSE.  We also had the taskforce report on the standardisation of business processes, a crucial document which will ensure for the first time that the way in which one LHO, local health office, or one region of the HSE deals with a child who presents and who is vulnerable or at risk is the same regardless of where he or she presents in the country.  We also have a knowledge management strategy which will, when fully rolled out, provide policy makers and anyone using the system with a contemporaneous picture of the type of child protection services available in the country at any one time.We must respond comprehensively to the specific issues raised by HIQA in respect of foster care which have been ventilated in the newspapers and media in recent days and the lessons and risks posed by those findings when that report is finally presented by HIQA.  We must also consider the implications it will have for the wider child protection service in Ireland.  Taken together, these reforms must be put in place to ensure the child protection system operates to the highest standards.Following the publication of the Ryan commission report, I carried out as wide a discussion as possible with the various survivor groups in Ireland and the UK.  I met with many of the NGOs to discuss the best possible reaction.We produced an implementation plan on 28 July 2009.  It is important to emphasise that the final paragraph of that implementation plan commits me to presenting a report to the Government every year.  The anniversary of that will be the end of July.  Naturally, the Dáil will not be sitting at that time so I propose to present a report to Government at the end of June and to bring it before the House in order that it can be properly discussed before the anniversary when the House will not be sitting.The implementation plan spans a four-year timeframe and is reflected in the provision of additional funding of €15 million in budget 2010 to facilitate implementation.  In overall terms, the plan addresses the various action points under two distinct headings.  The first of these is focused on the survivors of abuse and the second is targeted at children in the care of the State of today.  It is worth emphasising that the survivor groups have consistently stated that one of their key motivators is to ensure children in care today are provided with much better services than was afforded to them.The plan is very ambitious in what it sets out to achieve.  This is deliberate.  By setting ourselves clearly identified and ambitious timescales to achieve these actions we are challenging ourselves to meet the standards we have set for ourselves.  That we are doing this in a time of extreme economic difficulty only serves to highlight the commitment of Government to improve services for children in the care of the State.As I mentioned, the implementation plan focuses on both the survivors of institutional abuse and on children in care and detention today.  I would like to address both of these areas.  In regard to the survivors of abuse, the implementation plan made a number of specific recommendations.  The very first action point provided for the establishment of a committee to examine an appropriate memorial for the victims of institutional abuse.  I am pleased to report that this committee was established last October and its work is progressing.  The committee has been consulting widely and I look forward to the outcome of its deliberations.Another key action in regard to survivors was the commitment to provide additional counselling resources.  Counselling for survivors is provided by way of the national counselling service, NCS.  This is a professional, confidential counselling and psychotherapy service, available in all HSE areas.  An additional €2 million has been made available to the service in the current year to meet this commitment.  Furthermore, and as set out in the implementation plan, the NCS has been exempted from the public service moratorium on recruitment and replacement of staff.I have had some very positive discussions with various NGOs interested in providing these services.  Clearly, some people are not happy to engage with such services provided by the State given the negative experiences they had engaging with the State in previous times.  The national counselling service can purchase counselling services from outside the statutory provision.I would like to address the issue of services for children in the care of the State today.  Child protection remains a critical area of Government policy.  It is open to much scrutiny which, in itself, is a welcome catalyst for change. At present, there are approximately 5,700 children in the care of the State.  Between relative and general foster care in excess of 5,130 children are accommodated in a family setting.  This reflects the Government's commitment to ensuring that children are placed in a stable family environment, allowing them to develop close bonds that nurture their emotional and physical needs.Successive public debates on child protection have indicated that our policy and legislative framework is sound but that implementation and service delivery must be overhauled.  What the implementation plan sets out to address is the reality that despite this strong legislative and policy base, service delivery for children in need and children at risk is not sufficiently co-ordinated, is unevenly distributed nationally and must be improved.That said, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the vital work carried out by social work teams who deal with difficult child protection cases on a daily basis.  Some of the debate in this area is not very well informed.  Too often it is forgotten that children who present to our child protection and welfare services have been already failed by many agencies and other interventions.  It would be wrong to conclude in all cases that factors external to the HSE do not contribute to the difficulties experienced.  We must be honest about that and broaden this debate when talking about deaths in care and related issues and look at the other factors which might have led to tragedies or the very challenging behaviours some of these children present.Some of us read in the newspapers last Saturday that many staff in special care units are on extended sick leave because of the stress of the work they do and the challenging nature of the behaviour of some of these children.  Some Members will have read in the last Saturday's newspapers reports that many staff in special care units are on extended sick leave because of the stress of their work due to the challenging nature of the behaviour of some of these children.  It is extremely tough work.  That is the case not only in special care units but in the case of every type of social work.  We must acknowledge that of the 5,700 children in the care of the State today, the vast majority of them are being extremely well looked after.  They have the best intervention they could possibly hope for, but in acknowledging that, we must also acknowledge the deficit, and that is the focus of all policy at this stage.One of the principal commitments in the Ryan implementation plan is the need to ensure that all children in care have an allocated social worker and a care plan.  To this end, the Government has committed to filling 270 HSE social worker posts by the end of 2011 and to the front-loading of this initiative in 2010, with the filling of 200 posts by the end of this year.  This initiative is designed to target resources at front-line services in order to ensure that the HSE fulfils its statutory obligations.  The Oireachtas has voted that the necessary finance be provided; the filling of these posts has been exempted from the public service moratorium on recruitment and replacement of staff; and there is an explicit commitment in the HSE service plan for 2010, as laid before the Oireachtas, that these posts will be filled.I met senior HSE representatives, including the chairman of the board, in recent days to review the progress being made in this regard.  The HSE has advised me that approximately 400 candidates are to be interviewed, starting next week, in order to form a new panel of suitable candidates to fill all 200 posts in the current year.  The recruitment of these additional social workers is critical in terms of progressing the implementation plan and in ensuring the allocation of a named social worker to each child in care and the availability of care plans, properly updated, for all of these children.   It is also important in order to ensure that all foster carers are properly assessed.  I have been assured by the HSE that the matter is being afforded the highest priority by the board and by senior management.  I will discuss this matter, together with other child protection matters, with the board of the HSE tomorrow.There have been calls in recent days for the removal of child protection services from the HSE and for a new entity to be established to discharge the duties of the State in this regard.  I do not share this view.  While it may appear politically appealing, a fundamental aspect of a successful child care system is the ability to access early interventions, whether they are therapies delivered by health professionals or supports offered by public health nurses.  In particular, there is an essential requirement to integrate our child protection services as part of the development of multidisciplinary services, both at hospital and primary care level.  We have an opportunity now to plug into the developing primary care network around this country and it would be a mistake to miss that opportunity.  Stripping away children's services from the HSE, therefore, will not go solve the problem.  It is a quick fix solution to a very complicated problem and, as we know, quick fixes seldom result in lasting changes.There is a risk that we would lose ground, as it would take several years to establish a new structure and valuable time would be lost in creating a new entity.  A new name does not guarantee strong leadership, effective team-working and standardised ways of delivering a professional service.  Much more needs to be done to build a strong and responsive service and a fresh approach is required within the HSE to deliver the change that we all wish to see.  This has been reinforced by the events of recent weeks.  In the course of my discussions with the HSE yesterday, I raised the need for the appointment of an individual at a national management level who has a proven track record in the reform of children and family services and who should, in my view, have a direct reporting relationship with the board and the chief executive.  I briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the initiative last night and drew a parallel between the role that Professor Tom Keane played very successfully in cancer care and the new role I envisage for child welfare and protection.  I emphasise that it would be my intention that this postholder would report directly to the chief executive just as Professor Keane did in the area of cancer control.  The HSE was very receptive to the proposal and committed to working with me to source and appoint a person who would have the authority to deliver on the wide and ambitious reform programme.  I propose to discuss these matters with the HSE board tomorrow.The creation of this new position is a logical development and very much consistent with the emphasis in the PA report on strengthening management systems in the HSE in this area.  It complements the steps already taken in implementing this report with the appointment, for the first time, of a senior person within the HSE with responsibility for the delivery of these services.  This post, at assistant national director level, is an important first step in seeking to reform the child protection services in the HSE.  The appointment is being accompanied by the restructuring of the service at national, regional and local level in order to strengthen front line delivery of services.The HSE intends to publish the PA report this week, along with the HSE's own report of the children and family services task force, which provided a valuable insight into the current structure and deficits in the services.  It is also my intention, beginning next Friday, to visit social workers at four venues around the country to have discussions on their impressions of the progress being made and the issues that need to be raised.  The taskforce was also closely involved in the development of much needed and standardised business processes across the HSE child protection services.  These will be necessary to facilitate the proper implementation of the new national child care information system, a national ICT system which will provide a basis for collecting and reporting on the delivery of front line services and which will help to strengthen accountability within the HSE.Another key priority for me, as Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, was the commitment to publish a revised Children First Guidelines. The original guidelines, first published in 1999, were revised and placed on the OMCYA website in December 2009, in line with a commitment in the implementation plan.  A number of amendments have been made in the interim to take on board, for example, recommendations from the Ombudsman for Children in her recent report on the implementation on the Children First Guidelines and the recent guidance provided by HlQA to the HSE with regard to the deaths of children in care and serious adverse incidents.  Arrangements for the printing and dissemination of the guidelines are being finalised.  In addition, legislation is to be drafted to provide a duty to comply with Children First for all bodies in receipt of State funding, and that commitment is to be achieved by the end of this year.I will bring proposals to Government very shortly setting out a comprehensive implementation framework, including a particular emphasis on strengthening the audit and inspection framework to exist in parallel with the statutory framework.  This is to ensure that the guidelines are more effectively and correctly implemented across all sectors working with children.  I anticipate that HIQA will have a very important role to play in this framework.It is important that the weaknesses identified in various reviews of Children First are addressed in order to ensure that the State, voluntary sector and the wider community are aware of their obligations with regard to the protection of children and that appropriate mechanisms are in place to ensure that these obligations are met.  Children First brings with it very clear responsibilities for those who become aware of child protection issues and these responsibilities are those we would reasonably expect everyone in society caring for children at risk to live up to.On the issue of deaths  in care, it should be noted that the creation of guidance was one of the targets of the implementation plan and that has been completed.  It provides, for the first time, a national standard for systematically reviewing and reporting on child deaths and already some cases have been referred under this new system.Delivery of any service must necessarily be underpinned by appropriate standards.  The rationale for having a single set of standards is that the core principles apply to all children living away from home.  Children have developmental needs and rights irrespective of their reason for coming into care.  The core standards apply to all of the inspected services with some specific criteria dealing with the different contexts in which services are delivered.The social services inspectorate of the Health Information and Quality Authority is in the process of developing a new set of standards for services for children in care.  The standards are currently being amended by HIQA to take account of the response from the recent public consultation exercise and work on this is due to be completed by the end of this month. I expect that the final standards will be sent to me in October of this year.In the time available to me I have set out the progress made to date in implementing the high level commitments, as set out in the Government's plan.  I acknowledge that there are also a number of areas where progress has not been as rapid as I would have wished.  In the case where certain actions have not yet been completed, I remain determined to see that all of the actions are delivered.  In this regard, and in order to ensure the momentum of progress, I chair a high level group consisting of senior representatives from the relevant Departments and agencies to monitor the implementation of the actions specified in the plan.  This group has met twice to date and will shortly finalise its first report on progress as required under the plan.  Once finalised, I look forward to laying this progress report before both Houses and I will do this annually over the four-year lifetime of the plan.  Although the anniversary falls towards the end of July, I propose to place that report before the Houses before the House rises for the summer recess.As I stated at the time of the publication of the Government's implementation plan, the damage caused by a culture that tolerated and even encouraged physical, sexual and emotional abuse for decades will not be undone by words alone.  Similarly, the failures in our services today will not be fixed by words and fine sentiments.  Action and delivery must follow.As a Government we have demonstrated our commitment to put in place the necessary resources to build a strong and responsive child protection system for those in greatest need.  We have a detailed and ambitious programme of work which requires a sustained effort across various organisations and by the wider society.  The role of Government is to provide leadership in promoting necessary change and reform.  What I have set out today represents the action plan to which we are working and which will be the subject of continuing engagement within the House and elsewhere.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I welcome the opportunity again in this House to discuss child care and protection issues and, in particular, to look at the progress made since publication by the Minister of State of the implementation plan in respect of the Ryan commission report.  One can only conclude that since publication of the report there has been minimal real progress or improvement with regard to our child care and protection services.  Indeed, the past 12 months have been marked by a series of scandalous revelations, which clearly shows that the obsessive secrecy that the church was criticised for in covering up instances of abuse is an ethos shared both by Government and by the HSE in covering up the scandalous failures to provide protection to children to which they were entitled.The Minister of State for some time after his appointment defended our child care and protection services when I described their dysfunction.  His out was to say, "We have robust child care guidelines", and then to make a pretence that the service was functional.  What has become absolutely clear is that the service is seriously dysfunctional and the Minister of State more or less admitted this in two comments he made earlier.  He stated, "What the implementation plan sets out to address is the reality that despite this strong legislative and policy base, service delivery for children in need and children at risk is not sufficiently co-ordinated, is unevenly distributed nationally and must be improved", and he went on to say, "Much more needs to be done to build a strong and responsive service and in my view a fresh approach is required within the HSE in order to deliver the change that we all wish to see".  It is as if the Government and the Minister of State are completely separate from anything to do with the delivery of child care services, that they have no responsibility for the disasters and catastrophes of the past decade and here we have this brand new Minister of State who has suddenly discovered there is a problem which he hopes to address.The truth is, despite publication of child protection guidelines in 1999, no coherent structure was ever put in place to ensure the high ideals of those guidelines were properly observed.  No proper management was put in place within a Department to oversee implementation of the child care guidelines.  No proper communications system was put in place within either the former health boards or the HSE to even facilitate the maintenance of proper records with regard to children reported to be at risk, the decisions taken with regard to such reports and the action subsequently taken where children were found to genuinely be a concern.  No systems were put in place to ascertain where reports of risk were received but were not acted upon or where there was an assessment that, despite the report, there was no need for intervention to find out what happened to any of those children later.  No quality controls were there to identify where mistakes were made and, even more extraordinary, no detail was maintained, not even a statistical detail, of children who tragically died who were either in the care system or who were said to be "of concern".Very little has changed.  It has taken scandal after scandal and a drip-feed of information for us to formulate the extent of the dysfunction within our child care and protection services for which this Government is responsible.  This Fianna Fáil-led Government and its predecessors were responsible for the creation of the HSE.  The Minister for Health and Children steered through this House the legislation that transferred child care and protection services to the HSE from 1 January 2005 and then washed her hands of the service and took no interest in it.  Both the current Minister of State and his predecessors essentially saw themselves as policy gurus who would pronounce on high on policy issues relating to children and rely on the goodwill of the HSE to inform them of what was going on.  They now know what was going on.  We now know it is estimated — I do not believe these figures are accurate and I have said that in the past — 188 children who died were either in care or their care was a matter of concern to the HSE.  A total of 102 died as a consequence of what are known as "non-natural causes", of whom ten were identified as dying as a result of assault or murder.  This is the care the State provided to children at risk.This is the number of children it has taken 16 months to even ascertain.  I read with some interest the Minister for Health and Children saying that, "Deputy Andrews has been striving since March 2010 to get this information".  In March 2009 I sought that information in an Adjournment debate in the House and I was told the HSE was compiling it.  The only reason that information finally came to public notice was Fine Gael published the report into the tragic death of Tracey Fay.What has happened over the past 12 months?  The Ryan report implementation plan promised us 270 additional social workers for our child care and protection services.  In one part of the document published, it says that they will all be recruited by the end of December 2010 while, in another part, it says somewhere between 2010 and 2011.   Since the publication of the implementation plan, 25 of the 270 social workers have been recruited.  To what extent is that prioritising children at risk and ensuring we have the services available to them?There is great concern that those working with children be subject to vetting.  In September 2008, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children recommended vetting legislation for the use of soft information be published by December 2008.  Where is the Bill?  We do not even have heads of a Bill.  Nothing has been published.  There is no possibility that the legislation will become law until at least this time next year.  What about the Garda vetting bureau, which voluntarily carries out vetting of what I would described as "hard information" both for schools and voluntary agencies and other bodies employing people working with children?  Unfortunately, because of the huge pressure its staff are put under by  the large number of groups, organisations and schools seeking vetting, there is a 14-week delay in getting information when one seeks to ascertain whether an individual is suitable to work with children.  There is no sense of priority of any description.Where are we today with the child care provisions?  Only yesterday, Carl O'Brien of The Irish Times yet again revealed problems within our child care services.  I refer to the dysfunction within the foster care service.  I recall the Minister of State telling us there might be problems in the residential area but foster care is fine.  We now know there was an utter failure to apply the child care guidelines to ensure both in the HSE Dublin north west and Dublin north central areas children in foster care were properly dealt with.  Inspectors reviewed 1,114 files regarding 803 children in foster care and the main issues arising from this extensive audit were the inaccuracy and unreliability of information, unresolved child protection-child welfare issues, poor quality of records and inappropriate placement of children in supported lodgings.  Approximately 500 possible unresolved child welfare issues were identified.  The review of the files indicated possible child protection concerns relating to 76 different children.  Foster parents were not properly assessed, children did not have social workers allocated to them with whom they could communicate and child care plans were not in place.  What was clear was the absolute and abject failure to provide through the child care services to foster children the type of protection to which they are entitled.  That was in 2009 and 2010.  I have before me a letter sent to the Minister of State on 1 February 2010, detailing what occurred.Some of this is shocking.  On 14 November 2009 HIQA wrote to Professor Brendan Drumm raising some of the issues.  These include information on children in foster care held randomly on hard copy files and on the HSE's SWIS system of social work activity; no policy to guide which system should be used for different recordings; no consistency of recording of information; files stored unlocked in unsecured rooms in buildings shared with other organisations.  The latter is interesting.  The HSE, when asked to reveal its failures, constantly tries to avoid disclosing information based on its commitment to confidentiality in the interests of the child.  However, the HSE was prepared to store files and information, unlocked in unsecured rooms in buildings, in relation to children in foster care where those buildings were shared with other organisations.The files, to quote from the letter to Professor Drumm, contain unsecured loose leaf information that are not in an organised order, and are falling apart.  There are files missing, notes are often not dated nor signed and there are a number of items belonging to children, for example photographs, letters and a baby bracelet that have fallen from the files, with no identification to attach to the file or the child.  This was a disgrace.The Minister of State was first informed of the problems within those two areas with regard to fosterage by a letter dated 15 October 2009, and he concealed that information and did not inform this House as to what action he was taking, or the HSE would take.  I would say to the Minister of State that the constant drip-drip of revelations is undermining public confidence in our child care services.

It is due to complete that report at the end of this month.  To suggest that I would reveal the findings of that report during the course of its preparation and to describe this as concealment from the House is a very serious charge and it is very unfair.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	135	That is not a point of order.  The position is that HIQA took the unprecedented step on 15 October 2009 of writing to the Minister of State in advance of the report it was publishing, due to its enormous concern for the well-being of the children in foster care, whom it had discovered had not been properly provided for nor dealt with.That is information I believe the Minister should have shared with this House.  It is information that should have been brought to the attention of this House and in relation to it the Minister of State should have informed the House as regards what action, if any, was being taken by him and by the HSE to address the problems that had arisen.  Those problems were enormous.  I am quoting from the initial HIQA report with regard to the Dublin north-west area:   The number of children in foster care – 389; number of children without an allocated social worker – 189; number of foster carers without a link worker – 62.  The statistics for the Dublin north-central area are as follows:  The number of children in foster care – 309; number of children without an allocated social worker – 103; number of carers without a link worker – 109.This was contained in an interim report by HIQA to the Minister of State because of the catastrophic circumstances it discovered in the context of the abject failure of the HSE —  and this followed similar reports relating to deficiencies in those areas which first started to be made to successive Ministers of State with responsibility for children in 2004, and thereafter.  I want to know why the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the Minister for Health and Children did not put in place an oversight after the first report of problems in this area, relating to 2004.  Why did they go to sleep and do nothing until HIQA discovered what was happening?  The dysfunction that exists within our child care services, the lack of co-ordination and oversight and the attempts to escape from political accountability and responsibility continue to this very day, because——

I have limited time.It continues to this day, and not just in the area of foster care.  In the past few days I have received representations from a school that provides special education to children identified as severely emotionally and behaviourally disturbed.  The children who attend this school have been identified by child and adolescent mental health teams as suffering from severe behavioural disorders, such as ADHD or ODD, and most come from disadvantaged backgrounds where they have been exposed to drugs, drink, abuse and neglect at home.  These children are unable to attend mainstream education.  The representatives of this school contacted Fine Gael because they are so concerned at the failure of the HSE  to adequately respond to the needs of the children identified as being at risk.  I want to draw three cases to the attention of the Minister of State, and I shall conclude on this if the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to do so, having been interrupted twice.Child X is a student at the school, has been known to the HSE for at least four years and suffers from physical and emotional abuse and neglect at home.  The school has made several referrals to the HSE, as required under the child protection guidelines.  However, the response of the HSE has been so inadequate that the school has taken to telephoning the Garda every time the child presents with bruising.  Recently the child presented with severe physical injuries, a broken arm, but has still not been taken into care.Child Y is a ten year old student currently attending the school.  It has been known by the teachers for some time that this child suffers from serious physical and emotional neglect at home, so much so that the school has to buy shoes for the child because there were so many holes in the last pair.  The child's mother is understood to suffer from mental health problems and drug abuse.  The father is understood to have subjected both the mother and children to domestic violence.  Last December the child was diagnosed as having suicidal tendencies.  Despite this, the child's mother refuses to interact with the school, even when the child was found standing on a tiny ledge on the roof of the school, where he put himself in severe danger.  This child is crying out for help.  He is known to both the mental health and social services.  He desperately needs psychological help and intervention from the social services but the HSE is not providing it.The final child is a 14 year old former student of the school.  The parents of this child died from drug abuse in 2006 and 2007 and he has been in the State's care for the past three years.  During his time in school, the child displayed severe behavioural difficulties, including violent outbursts in front of staff.   The school has repeatedly tried to access help and has had regular meetings with social workers but no therapeutic intervention has taken place.  Two years ago the child had to be suspended indefinitely pending such intervention being put in place by the HSE but this has not been done.  For the past two years this child has drifted from one care home to another and is currently understood to be homeless.  He is known to have suffered medical seizures from consumption of head shop products, further highlighting the inadequacies of the child care services.I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle giving me leeway, and I will tell the Minister of State the name of the school involved.  I am telling him, as I have had to do on other occasions in this House, that these are three children who are today being failed by our child care services, which are grossly dysfunctional, unco-ordinated, have no modern communication systems and possess a managerial structure that is grossly inadequate.  The appointment of some additional supremo will not resolve the problem.I am asking the Minister of State to intervene in the interests of these children and I believe he is wrong in his conclusion.  We will only have a properly functioning child care and protection service when this function is taken away from the HSE and given to a body with the expertise and commitment to properly exercise it.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, known as the Ryan report, revealed some dreadful, harrowing and unforgivable mistreatment of children in the care of the State many years ago.  Unfortunately, Members can do nothing to bring back the childhood of those young people, who now are adults.  All that can be done for them is to provide a certain level of compensation, as well as an apology, to allow them to tell their stories and to provide a level of counselling, advice and so on.  However, having spoken to many of the individuals concerned over the years, the most overriding request they have made of Members as parliamentarians is to ensure that this kind of thing can never happen to children again and to ensure that children are properly cared for in the present.Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Obviously, what happens to children today is nothing like what happened to the children who were locked up in institutions in the past.  However, as the cases of children such as Tracey Fay and Daniel McAnaspie reveal, many children have been failed by the State.  It now is known that over the past ten years, 188 children have died, who had been in contact in some way with the child protection services of the State.  It also has become evident in the last few days, on foot of a report, that currently many children have not been allocated a social worker and their care has not been inspected.  Many children have been moved around from place to place and do not have anything like the normal securities of a childhood that all children need.This must be an absolute priority.  Governments make decisions and allocate funding on the basis of priorities and this must be contrasted with the speed with which the system moved to address the problems of the banking system when the latter suddenly was in trouble in the autumn of 2008.  I refer to the overnight meetings, instant legislation and the availability of billions of euro from the public purse.  Saving the life of Anglo Irish Bank was sufficiently important to throw billions into it and I note further billions were added to it recent weeks.  However, saving the life of Daniel McAnaspie obviously was not anywhere near as important as saving Anglo Irish Bank.  Fundamentally, that is what Members should be discussing today.  They should be putting right the priorities on how public money is spent and how public business is conducted.  Clearly, the child care service is not at that level of priority.The Minister of State's script today states:The plan is very ambitious in what it sets out to achieve.  This is deliberate.  By setting ourselves clearly identified and ambitious timescales to achieve these actions we are challenging ourselves to meet the standards which we have set for ourselves.  That we are doing this in a time of extreme economic difficulty only serves to highlight the commitment of Government to improve services for children in the care of the State.However, the problem is with the amount of money that is going into child care.  I acknowledge that a certain amount is being invested and that a certain amount of progress has been made, but when one contrasts that with the urgency with which the problems in the banking sector were addressed by the Government at large, there is no comparison.  My colleague, Deputy Higgins, frequently makes the point in the Chamber that a floor of rights is required.  Safety nets are needed under which no citizen of this State can fall.  Unfortunately, such safety nets do not exist for children in care.The figures that were revealed last week, as well as the other statistics that have emerged subsequently, particularly in respect of two areas in north Dublin and the report drawn up by HIQA, indicate there is clearly still a huge level of dysfunction within the child care services.  I simply do not believe that the sense of urgency to address this exists.  This must be treated not simply as business as usual but as a crisis and as something that requires special intervention and a special plan.  I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Shatter that the HSE lacks the capacity to do this.  I welcome the announcement that there is to be a new supremo who will be in charge of child care services, which certainly is needed.  However, can this be done within the manner in which the HSE organises its budgets?  I read that as essentially that the person nominated will manage the same budget that is provided for child care at present.This is not good enough and the same approach must be taken in this regard as was taken in the case of Professor Keane and cancer control, whereby he was told that were additional resources required in respect of shortfalls in the service, they would be provided.  With respect to the delivery of cancer care, the child care system is a great deal more complicated.  While it may not cause as many deaths as cancer, it is considerably more complicated to organise and I am unsure whether the HSE has the capacity to address its complexities and in particular, to operate a coherent and properly-resourced system.As for the number of social workers who are being appointed, I understand that out of the total of 270, some 25 already have been appointed.  I believe the Minister of State has indicated that 200 additional social workers are promised by the end of this year.  However, the appointment of only 25 additional posts right across the system really will not make the kind of difference that is required.  Consequently, there must be a prioritisation of this issue at Government level and with respect to the Minister of State, a senior Minister will be required in this regard for some time.  While it could be the Minister of State or someone else, someone at Cabinet level will be needed to address this issue.  It needs this level of crisis management when one considers what happened to the aforementioned young people.  When one looks at photographs of Tracey Fay and Daniel McAnaspie and reads about them when they were younger, it is clear those children had a sense of hope and of having a stake in society.  There was a sense they had a future, were engaged with education and so on.  Somewhere along the line, the system entirely failed those children and many others like them.  At present, many other children are being similarly failed because of the manner in which the system is organised.A number of actions have been promised in the implementation plan report.  Some relate to survivors of child abuse in the past but many of them relate to reorganising and restructuring the system for the future.  I wish to read into the record an e-mail.  All Members have received a large number of e-mails headed "Please support the Saving Childhood Ryan campaign" and the reason I wish to read it out is because it sets out clearly the points that must be addressed.  It starts by stating "[e]nsure that a referendum to strengthen children's rights in the Constitution is held".  Clearly this has been promised but there appears to be no indication that such a referendum will be held sooner rather than later.  It must be held as soon as possible because once children's rights are written into the Constitution, from that will flow other rights and will flow the necessity to implement measures that will protect children.  The children who need the protection of the Constitution are the highly vulnerable children who are being failed at present.The second suggested action is to "speed up the legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis and widen its remit to include all organisations and individuals, including faith organisations, sports bodies and volunteer groups".  The next suggested action is to "ensure children's voices are heard in all matters affecting them".  I note this suggestion has been included in the implementation plan and believe it to be highly important.  The next suggested action is to "develop the necessary legislative and policy framework to make statutory provision for the right of children's voices to be heard in judicial proceedings affecting them. . . introduce and progress the National Vetting Bureau Bill, ensuring that the Bill provides adequately for the sharing of information between relevant agencies".  Although that Bill has been promised for many years, it still has not been brought to the floor of this House.  I believe it is highly important because it pertains to sharing information that is not shared at present and to the protection of children.The next suggestion is to "ensure all children in care have an allocated social worker and care plan".  This is an issue that all Members have addressed already and clearly this is not in place.  Hundreds of children who are in care do not have an allocated social worker.  Many issues arise in respect of social workers.  I feel sorry for social workers who are trying to work within the system because many of them are inexperienced and face extraordinary challenges.  Many of the young people concerned have a behaviour that is extremely difficult.  While I understand all that, this does not mean that one can somehow suggest this is too difficult and cannot be done.  However, social workers must be supported and must be provided with sound structures to support them to enable them to do their difficult work.The next suggestions are to:Evaluate the National Children's Strategy 2000-2005 and begin the consultation process in preparation for the development of the next Strategy;Provide the necessary funding to those providing support services to survivors of institutional child abuse;Amend the Child Care Act 1991 via the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009 to place a statutory obligation on the State to provide aftercare for all children who need it and develop a comprehensive national aftercare policy.That is something on which we are also being lobbied on the Child Care (Amendment) Bill.  I hope the Minister will accept that amendment.The next suggestions are as follows: Ensure that separated children moving into care placements are provided with adequate supports to meet their specific needs; ensure these children have access to aftercare services; publish the promised national review of current practice in relation to Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 to establish current practices and gaps in the system for children experiencing homelessness; commence the Health Act 2007 to allow independent inspection of foster carers and all children's residential centres as a matter of urgency — it is amazing that we currently do not have that level of inspection for all children in care — grant the Health Information and Quality Authority more independence and robust powers to enforce compliance with child care regulations, through a range of mechanisms, including penalties, sanctions and fines.Those are the various points that are made.  They are all points that urgently need to be addressed.  Deputy Shatter referred to Carl O'Brien's report on the situation in north Dublin.  In his article Carl O'Brien stated: "The hypocrisy of our society is revealed by the fact that we continue to tolerate the neglect and abuse of children on a daily basis, while we profess shock and horror at the revelations of abuse and neglect of children decades ago."Today's debate is about learning from the past and implementing the protection that is required for children now and in the future.  I wish to ask the Minister of State about a number of elements, one of which relates to the comparative figures that were used by representatives of the Health Service Executive, HSE, during the week.  I heard two representatives of the HSE say that the 188 children who died in the past ten years who had contact with the child protection services was commensurate with other comparable countries.  I do not know where the representatives got that information or whether it is true, but I would like to know that this was not something that was said in order to make the figures look less shocking than they are.  Will the Minister of State indicate what comparative figures were examined?If we are to learn from the sad cases of all the individual children, each of whom is somebody's child, we need a breakdown of information relating to the years in which the children died, and the areas in which they lived.  We found out that two areas in Dublin had particular problems and difficulties and that has remained the case until recently.  We must find out exactly what happened to those children and where and when.  An overall figure such as we have received does not tell us what the individual circumstances were and what we can learn.  We must find out whether there were clusters, if children were let down or whether there was a breakdown of the service in particular areas.I do not say that because I wish to apportion blame to anyone, but we have to learn from what has gone wrong in the system in the past and what is going wrong currently.  I know a number of people who work with children in the care of the State.  It is extremely difficult work.  To what extent will there be a thorough examination of the entire system?  The vast majority of children in care are in foster care and they should have the required inspections by social workers.  However, a small number of vulnerable children are in other situations, for example, those in high security centres for children with difficult behaviour such as Coovagh House in my constituency, and the kind of children such as Daniel McAnaspie who are in hostels and other such situations.  I urge the Minister of State to carry out a full and thorough evaluation of the circumstances in which all of those children are currently in the care of the State.  I refer also to children who have come from other countries.  There are a number of categories of vulnerable children.  I sincerely doubt whether those children are getting the best possible care we could give them.  We can learn a lot from other countries where there are better systems.The catalogue of what we have heard in recent days is a true indictment of the kinds of priorities we have in society, given that we can focus such high-power attention on banks and lavish such a large amount of public money on them yet we cannot provide the resources for these vulnerable children.

That is only right and it is long overdue that we are addressing the implementation of those recommendations.  As I stated at the time of the publication of the Ryan report last year, as well as dealing with the abuses of the past we need most urgently to address the protection of children today or else we will have further Ryan reports, only this time they will deal with tragic failures to protect children of our own time.Yesterday, the family and friends of Daniel McAnaspie laid him to rest.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.  Three days earlier the Health Service Executive published its latest figures for the deaths of children known to the HSE child protection service.  That brings to 188 the number of children who died in the past decade, either in State care or who were known to the social services.  That is a truly shocking figure.  Each and every one of those deaths was a tragedy.  Some died of natural causes, some were due to suicide, drug overdoses, accidents or, as in the case of Daniel McAnaspie, unlawful killings.  We know about Daniel's case because the information has come into the public domain.  His family has been brave in speaking out.  Not all families wish to do so and their right to confidentiality must be respected, but we need to know the circumstances and we need to know exactly if and how the State failed these children.  How else will we learn the lessons of these failure?.  This much is certain; the death rate among children in State care and among children known to the social services is far higher than among the general population.  These are the vulnerable children, the marginalised children, the children in poverty or at risk of poverty, the children who have not benefited from education, the children who have suffered abuse, the children who become prey to drug pushers and other vicious social predators.Speaking at Daniel's funeral yesterday, Fr. Peter McVerry said that the boy had been neglected by the State and in that neglect we saw the failure of a dysfunctional and under-resourced child care service.  The Government should heed his words, especially his identification of the need not for 200 additional social workers but for 1,200.  The Minister of State was quick to dismiss the call by Fr. Peter McVerry, but he should seriously rethink his response because I have no doubt that Fr. McVerry was hitting the requirement absolutely spot-on.  The latest figures make it all the more urgent that the HSE releases the files on all these children to the special investigation team established by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  If legal obstacles really exist they should be removed as a matter of urgency.  The Government cannot even tell us when it will publish legislation in this regard.  It should publish in full its advice from the Attorney General.These figures come at a time when the Government is cutting back social welfare, education and health services in a way that hits marginalised families and vulnerable children worst.  These are the essential supports which help address child poverty and neglect.  Undermining these services through cuts will condemn more children.  A few days before the figures were published the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills announced the axing of librarian posts for school libraries in schools serving disadvantaged communities.  That is extremely callous and also very short-sighted.   It brings only shame on this entire Administration.The Government must take heed of the view expressed by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, that the in camera rule, whereby child care proceedings are not held publicly, is often being disproportionately applied and hampering investigations, and that any proposed legislative change should take account of this.  It is clear that there has long been a crisis of leadership and management at the highest level in child protection in the State given that an investigation established by a Minister could be frustrated in this way by a State body supposedly under the authority of the Minister, the HSE.Let me consider the specific recommendations of the Ryan report.  The very last one states, "‘Children First: The National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children' should be uniformly and consistently implemented throughout the State in dealing with allegations of abuse."  The recent report of the Ombudsman for Children concluded that the HSE, from its establishment in 2005 until 2009, made insufficient efforts to drive forward implementation of Children First, the child protection guidelines.  Poor administration was uncovered right across the HSE.  Clearly, this affects not only the process of identifying and protecting children at risk but also the system of care provision, which has been exposed repeatedly as totally inadequate.The implementation plan for the recommendations of the Ryan report, published by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, in July 2009, made a series of commitments regarding Children First.  These include the drafting of legislation by December 2010 to provide that all staff employed by the State and staff employed in agencies in receipt of funding from the Exchequer will have a duty to comply with the Children First national guidelines; the development by HIQA of outcome-based standards for child protection services, also by December 2010; and the linking of compliance with the Children First national guidelines will be linked to all relevant inspection processes across the education, health and justice sectors by December 2011.Specifically regarding the uniform and consistent implementation of Children First throughout the State, the implementation plan stated this was "ongoing".  It is difficult to square that with the report of the Ombudsman for Children, which I have cited twice, or with the fact that key commitments in this regard are not due for delivery until December 2010 and December 2011.The second last recommendation states, "The full personal records of children in care must be maintained."  The commentary on this recommendation states:Reports, files and records essential to validate the child's identity and their social, family and educational history must be retained.  These records need to be kept secure and up to date.  Details should be kept of all children who go missing from care.  The privacy of such records must be respected.It is clear from the current debacle regarding the deaths of children in care that this recommendation was very necessary.  However, we must all ask the extent to which it has been really implemented.The big question concerns why the Government and the HSE are constantly playing catch-up.  Why does it take a seemingly endless series of exposés, investigations and reports for them to begin to get things right?  The latest example is the audit of more than 1,000 foster-care files by HIQA in the Dublin north-west and Dublin north-central areas that has found well over 200 children had placements with unapproved foster parents for significant periods or were without care plans.The audit found that some children in State care have not had a visit from a social worker for up to ten years or more.  It found record-keeping so poor that inspectors have had difficulties establishing an accurate number for children in foster care, and many files were either incomplete, incorrectly recorded or missing.  In some cases, items belonging to children had fallen out of files with no identification to attach to the file or child.  Children as young as five were placed in supported lodgings, a more independent form of care designed for people in their mid to late teens.The report on the Monageer tragedy highlighted the vital need for an out-of-hours social work crisis intervention service.  The implementation plan said the HSE will put in place such a service, built into the existing HSE out-of-hours service, and that this would be piloted initially in two areas of the country.  That is far too lax an approach and the provision of this vital service must be speeded up.The Ryan report made key recommendations on policy.  It stated child care policy should be child-centred, the needs of the child should be paramount and national child care policy should be clearly articulated.  The report stated:The overall policy of childcare should respect the rights and dignity of the child and have as its primary focus their safe care and welfare.  Services should be tailored to the developmental, educational and health needs of the particular child.  Adults entrusted with the care of children must prioritise the well-being and protection of those children above personal, professional or institutional loyalty.The implementation plan is out of date now with regard to this recommendation because we have since had the report of the all-party committee and its unanimous recommendation on wording for a constitutional amendment on children.  In the view of Deputies of all parties in this House, the amendment would form a sound basis for all child care policy.  I again urge the Government to make a firm commitment to hold this year the referendum to strengthen the rights of children in the Constitution.I want to reiterate an issue that I raised in the House on previous occasions and I ask the Minister of State to respond thereto specifically.  In 1990, the Comptroller and Auditor General carried out a review of the Department of Education's special schools and it found that the children in those schools were not being accommodated in the institutions appropriate to their needs, that the facilities were not being managed properly and that the Department was not carrying out its oversight role in a satisfactory manner.In 1992 the Committee of Public Accounts, having considered the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, recommended that the Departments of Justice, Health, and Education, and the then health boards, jointly address the problem of these special schools and of all children in residential care.These recommendations were not acted upon.  The point is that the schools in question represented the end of the line for troubled children who ended up in court because behavioural, social and family problems were not properly addressed early on.  That is still happening, despite the fact that the first report was issued 20 years ago.  The scandal is that it is happening along the pathway of so-called care supposedly provided by the State.The reports to which I have referred date from 1990 and 1992.  It is bad that two decades have elapsed since the first without action.  Surely we should be setting target dates for the implementation of the recommendations such that we will not end up in a similar position two decades after the publication of the second, to everyone's shame in this House.Without question, these reports represented early alarm bells.  Alarm bells have rung periodically since their publication but precious little was done, with the results we see so sadly today and which have been exposed recently in the litany of tragedies that has shocked our nation.

We are trying to do a comprehensive job in a sensitive area.  The Ryan report is comprehensive and we must ensure that what has been the subject of the report will never happen to our children again.  The Minister of State during his contribution stated he has consulted widely with survivor groups in Ireland and Britain.  The survivor groups, however, are my concern.A number of articles have been written, one by Maeve Sheehan in the Sunday Independent, and two by Jennifer Hopp in the Irish Examiner, one on 21 December 2009 and one on 29 May 2010.  As a result of those articles I did some further research.  They all relate to money.  Following my research, I feel it is time for all of those organisations that are currently dealing with victims of abuse to account publicly for all of the funds each has received, how much and how they have been disbursed over the past ten years.  They must detail how much they have received from the State and the Roman Catholic Church.  There might be a problem getting such information from the Roman Catholic Church but as they are all registered charities, they must have accounts and, consequently, such information should be available.I am concerned about Ms Sheehan's article, which stated that more funds were being paid to lawyers than going to compensate the victims of child sexual abuse and that Cardinal Brady had been criticised by a solicitor acting for a victim for spending more money defending himself than was currently spent on the victim.  The article went on to say that a solicitor acting for a victim of Fr. Brendan Smyth said he was incredulous at the cardinal's public expressions of remorse, given his defence of himself in legal proceedings.  What was the man to do?  Is he not entitled to defined himself?I looked further into this.  With all of the groups involved, there was a multiple of legal representation.  How much has been paid in legal fees in this area over the past ten years?  Who are ACAL?  I looked this up on the survivors' webpage and under the heading of the lawyers, Abney Garrett and McDonald, solicitors, together with a group of other English solicitors, who intend, subject to the approval of the redress board, to co-ordinate all the English claims under ACAL, the association of child abuse lawyers.  When I see a league of lawyers I shudder for the outcome for the survivors.How much money has been paid to ACAL over the last ten years?  Abbey, Garrett and McDonald of 37 Station Road, Cheadlehulme are based in Chesire.Ms Hoff's articles in the Irish Examiner addressed information on funding she had elicited in the last year.  ACAL represents Right of Place and One in Four.  The article states that Right of Place receives hundreds of thousands of euro in funding from the Government annually.  In 2009, the HSE alone allocated €337,500 and the Department of Education and Science €75,331.  She continued that since 2002, it has collected more than €2.2 million from the HSE and the health board before that, and more than €1 million from the Department of Education and Science.  A further €88,000 was secured in national lottery funding.  Right of Place has also received unknown amounts from religious orders.  The documents seen by the Irish Examiner show the charity took in at least €100,000 from bishops and religious orders around the country in a three year period.  Millions of euros have been given to these organisations and lawyers are queuing up to avail of the funding.It is about time we had an audit of all of the various organisations that have mushroomed as a result of child sexual abuse over the past number of years.  A certain degree of in-fighting has erupted among the groups and the only winners will be the lawyers while the losers, inevitably, will be the victims in the Ryan report.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I must comment on Deputy McDaid's contribution to this debate.  This is about children, and while there is concern about where money was spent, if there was proper care for children here and if when they went into care they were truly cared for there would not be any need for these umbrella organisations to spring up.  They have their problems, and I have grave concerns about the amount that is spent on legal fees, but that is for another day.The recommendations of the report include provision for a referendum to strengthen children's rights under the Constitution.  The Minister of State has promised in the past that this will happen some time.  Some time this year?  Some time in the autumn?  Some time in the winter?  Hopefully, we will place the legislation for Children First on a statutory footing and widen its remit to include all organisations and individuals, including faith, sports and volunteer groups.  The importance of placing something on a statutory footing, as the Minister of State is aware, is that it allows for accountability, or it should.  The guidelines are in place but they are not being implemented.  Not alone are the guidelines in Children First not being implemented, the statutory guidelines are not being implemented and no one has been brought to book.Some foster children have not been visited in ten years while foster parents are not being vetted.  This is a serious situation and placing things on a statutory footing is meaningless unless there is someone to oversee them.  Ultimately, oversight is a political imperative.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	144	Where is the senior Minister, the Minister for Health and Children?  Today, when we find another scandal seeping out, this time about pregnant women and their in utero babies, there is no sign of the Minister doing anything except talking about legislation for sunbeds.  We sought sunbed legislation for years but it is placed at No. 70 on the legislative list.This is a classic case of the Minister manipulating the news to suit herself.  There is no comment on the fact that there have now been three cases, with more emerging, of patients being told the devastating news that their unborn child is dead when the opposite was the case.  If they had not the courage of their convictions, something that is unfair to expect of someone who has just been shattered by such devastating news, and the composure to demand a second opinion, those children would have been lost to them.  That is completely unacceptable.Last a week a great servant of the State, a paramedic, fell to his death out of an ambulance.  What advice did the HSE offer?  To duct-tape the doors.  In 2010?The HSE is out of control.  How many months is it since Deputy Shatter first sought reports on the numbers of children who have died in care or who have come to the attention of the State?  He asked for that information in February and we are only now getting this information.The HSE is not fit for purpose and it should not be trusted with the care of our children.  It has failed abysmally.  The numbers are truly shocking.  I can identify with the parents who have made the dreadfully hard decision to place their children in care in the belief the system will give the better care the parents cannot provide.  They then find that the children did not get that care but ended up with the worst possible outcome, tragic death.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	145	It is a year since this House last debated the Ryan report but it feels much more recent.  Why is that?  It is because over the period of a year one could reasonably have expected significant improvements in our child protection measures.  Instead, we are once again mired in reports of gross negligence on the part of the State and the grotesque situation where the State is not entirely sure how many children died while the State was in loco parentis.
The State seems unwilling to learn lessons from the past.  For example, a report from the Committee of Public Accounts in 1990 made a series of recommendations on the co-ordination of child care services among Departments and State agencies to form an operational strategy to address issues concerning children in care.  Some 20 years later, we still do not have such a strategy in place.My colleagues have already discussed this issue in its national context so I will confine myself to two issues.  First, the ongoing exclusion of those who were sexually abused in primary schools from any redress scheme is a national disgrace.  It is immoral of the State to abdicate its responsibilities for school children.  In the strict legal sense, boards of management were responsible for school management but these boards were made up of voluntary local people who rarely had the knowledge or wherewithal necessary to cope with sexually deviant clergy.  I am not excusing boards that stood idly by, merely contrasting the situation of a voluntary committee often dominated by an authoritarian parish priest with a powerful Department with access to all the best practice manuals and legal advice it desired.  Where complaints were made directly to the Department, the Department should have taken control of the situation.  It failed and, decades later, the Department continues to wash its hands of the unpleasant side of school management.  It decides on teaching standards and the curriculum and issues circulars laying down the law on almost every aspect of school life.  However, when a child is abused in a school, the Department runs a mile, claiming the matter is none of its business.The victims of Offaly teacher, Mr. Brander, are included in the Ryan report yet they are excluded from the redress scheme.  The litany of abuse detailed in chapter 14 leads to the conclusion that the State cannot persist in washing its hands of responsibility for the abuse perpetrated by teachers on its payroll.  The approach to victims of abuse in primary schools must be changed.  We need legislative change in this area to close the legal loophole that is allowing the Department of Education and Skills to shirk its responsibilities.Chapter 14 of the Ryan report also highlights major anomalies in the way files were maintained by the Department.  Has the Minister of State contacted the Tánaiste to provide a report on the extent to which filing protocols and record-keeping deficiencies have been addressed?  I recently requested information by way of parliamentary question on how many teachers have been convicted of sexual offences in respect of children in their care but the information could not be provided.  The Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Courts Service and the CSO do not keep such records.  Keeping complete and accurate files in regard to its teachers is the very least that can be expected of the Department of Education and Skills.The second issue I wish to highlight relates to the numerous problems faced by foster parents in the Laois-Offaly constituency.  Services previously provided for parents have been withdrawn, meaning foster parents are incurring additional costs without compensation from the State.  Social worker services are inadequate and social workers are stretched to the limits.  Consequently, not all foster children have care plans within an acceptable timeframe.  Social workers are unable to give foster children the care they need.  The Minister of State said he was frontloading the appointments but I wonder how many will be allocated to the former midland health board area.Foster parents are unsung heroes in our community.  Their contribution should be recognised and valued.  Obviously, foster care must also be carefully regulated to ensure children are protected.  We must legislate to provide that foster parents can straightforwardly adopt foster children in appropriate circumstances.  We must ensure the foster care service is nourished and resourced and that people are made aware of the opportunity to act as foster parents.  Placing children with a foster family is far more satisfactory than dumping them in a hostel or other facility and the litany of tales of children dying while in State care supports that approach.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I am delighted to take part in this debate.  A significant amount of further information has emerged since we debated the matter in June of last year.  There have also been further appalling revelations of abuse perpetrated on the most innocent in our society over the course of many years.  There have also been cases documented over the past months of neglect of our children as well as much debate on safeguards needed to protect the welfare of children and the rights of our children as should be outlined in the Constitution.  The nature of such a debate and discourse suggests there has been a major change in attitude to issues of welfare and protection of children.  I welcome this.I want the Ryan report recommendations implemented as quickly as possible.  In my new portfolio, with links to the Department of Education and Skills, child safety and protection in the school system will be rigorously pursued.  Procedures will be put in place to ensure a high degree of awareness on the part of teachers and boards of management in schools to highlight cases in our classrooms.  When I spoke in the House last year I highlighted the 1936 Cussen report, which recommended the integration of those in industrial schools into the community.  It was not completed until the 1960s.  I look forward to a speedier implementation of the Ryan report recommendations.  As someone who taught for a brief spell, we must ensure our children are safe in school and have the freedom to speak about their concerns.  Section 7.14 of the Ryan recommendations reads: "Children in care should be able to communicate concerns without fear."  If the home life of children is distressing and they are in care, children should have the opportunity to speak to people they trust.Counselling and education services must be freely available in childhood years and subsequently.  I met many victims who have come to me in Leinster House and in my constituency who made the point that the counselling and education services must continue for many years.  How can people get over those dark periods of their lives when the State let them down?Section 7.10 of the recommendations refers to the need for rules and regulations to be enforced, breaches to be reported and sanctions applied where necessary.  We have had much debate about adoption and the heartbreak of grown adults seeking their birth mothers and fathers.  Section 7.20 of the report refers to full personal records of children in care being maintained.  Can anyone imagine seeking these records and finding they were not available?  This would cause heartbreak if the parents had died and one was just about to find the file and examine the records.  It is essential the State maintains these records to validate a child's self-esteem and identity and social, family and educational history.  We must ensure the recommendation in section 7.20 is implemented in full so children who have suffered at the hands of the State can be given a guideline to their past and a passport to a brighter future.

I suggest the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White, examines the issue of separated migrant children who have disappeared from State care.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Since 2000, at least 508 migrant children placed in HSE accommodation have disappeared after being placed in care by the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  Of even greater concern is that only 67, or one in seven, of these vulnerable children have ever been traced.  It is clear some of these young children are being coerced or enticed from State care into lives of depravity and prostitution.  There is strong evidence that HSE hostels are little more than grooming grounds for those seeking to prey on vulnerable children.  This is the child abuse scandal of tomorrow and clearly shows that nothing has been learned form the scandals of the past or from the litany of abuse outlined in the Ryan report.Moreover, the cover-up continues.  Because of the so-called industrial action by staff, the HSE is denying this House data regarding the number of separated children placed in care this year and the number who have vanished.  The figures I have been able to obtain indicate that one in five children in care has disappeared this year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews,  indicated last year that it is the State's objective to treat all unaccompanied children seeking asylum in the same way as Irish children in State care are treated.  He is to be commended on that objective.However, in February this year we had the first public acknowledgment by the HSE that its standard of care for migrant children placed under its responsibility by the Garda was substandard when compared with that provided to Irish children. The Irish Times published comments by a senior director in the HSE, Mr. Philip Garland, who accepted that the organisation has failed migrant children and that they are being treated differently from Irish children.  The HSE was aware right through the boom years that children disappearing from their hostels were being exploited.  In some cases they had been previously taken out of dire situations, such as brothels.  At the beginning of this year there were reports of two children found in brothels in the State, one of whom was just 15 years old.  There is no doubt that the HSE’s failure to act has facilitated the labour and sexual exploitation of vulnerable children.The reason for the double standard of care is the lack of a voice to speak up for these children.  They have no parents or relatives to ask the hard questions.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on the 167 children who died subsequent to disappearing from HSE accommodation, according to the figures released by the HSE last week?  How many of those were unaccompanied minors?  I put this question to the HSE yesterday but, as I am not a journalist, I do not expect a response for months.  It is totally unacceptable that the media can access information far quicker than can Members of this House, which is the democratic parliamentary institution of the State.  We are told the system is changing, that we will have answers and that there will be transparency.  What is happening at the moment, however, is appalling.It is vital that these children have an independent advocate with the sole purpose of ensuring their best interests are protected.  Not only is there no such advocate but many of these children do not even make it on to the missing children's website.  Last year the Ombudsman for Children pointed out that one of the separated children with whom she was dealing disappeared during study leave and was not highlighted on the missing children's website.  In the case of at least one in six children who disappear, there is no indication of that disappearance on the website.The Ryan report frightens us to the core and we must ensure such abuse never recurs.  What is needed now is not words but action.  The Government must immediately end the practice of placing separated children in hostels without proper care, supervision or standards.  The dereliction of care on behalf of the State has allowed those who exploited and abused children in the past to go undetected.  We cannot and must not let that continue, simply on the basis of the colour of the child's skin.

It is ironic that we are discussing the implementation of a report into the abuse and neglect of children on a day when we have heard horror stories, albeit stories with happy endings, about the negligence of the Health Service Executive towards unborn children and their mothers.  It is unbelievable that the House does not have the opportunity to discuss this matter today.  It is even worse that the Minister for Health and Children has not made any statement, nor tried to ease the concerns of countless women, and their partners, who have suffered the tragedy of miscarriage and are wondering whether they should have sought a second opinion, been more forceful or asked more questions.  We can only hope the cases we heard about today are isolated instances.  The silence of those with political and professional responsibility for the health service is deafening.  How many more question marks must emerge over the HSE before we finally have an effective and safe health service?  How many more crises will come to light?  At the very least, the Minister should make time today to give a statement to the House and to the public on this matter.We have discussed the past so often, particularly in terms of child protection, that I sometimes wonder whether we have learned anything at all.  However, we have an opportunity now to debate what will change and when we will see that change.  At least there is finally a plan, although I share my colleagues' concerns about the HSE's ability to implement it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, claims the system is not broken beyond repair.  However, we are a long way from being the envy of every country in the world, as the Minister of State adverted to in his statement.Like many others, I have seen at first hand the hard work done by individual social workers, public health nurses and others involved in the care of young people.  Yet despite the enormous and under-estimated pressures that social workers are under, the Government has filled only 25 of the 270 places promised this year.  Why not front-load all 270 places, especially given that there are more than 400 applicants?  When does the Government intend to put in place a 24-hour social work service?  Many families feel isolated and alone on Friday evenings, facing into the weekend knowing there is little or no help available to them if there is a difficulty.  Now is the time, before the 270 vacancies are filled,  to implement the changes that will ensure we have a service that is genuinely available around the clock.Social workers need far more support from senior management in the HSE and from other State agencies.  I am repeatedly made aware of the lack of cohesion among the various Departments with responsibility for children.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has a responsibility to ensure those Departments engage with each other.  During the last debate on this issue I gave the example of a child who was forced out of foster care because of the lack of support from a particular school and from the National Educational Psychological Service.  Such issues will not be addressed effectively while that lack of cohesion persists.The comments by Fr. Peter McVerry at the funeral yesterday of Daniel McAnaspie should not be ignored.  Fr. McVerry is at the coalface in these matters, dealing every day with the realities of life for these children.  He sees how chaotic the system is, and it is vital that we take his views on board.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has a huge challenge ahead of him.  I wish him well in what is one of the most important jobs in Government.  While it is a political challenge for him and for the Government, it is a life and death challenge for the thousands of children in care.  That is the responsibility that rests upon him.  He needs the support of legislative change to ensure he can do his job properly.  That is why it is so important that what has been recommended in this plan is implemented without delay.  We must hold a referendum and expedite the legislation implementing the Children First guidelines and broaden its remit, as recommended.  We must also progress the Bill on Garda vetting which has gone up and down the legislative programme but has not yet seen the light of day.The will is there among the public to implement change.  What is needed now is action.  Otherwise, we will be back here in the future to discuss another tragedy and to lament the failure to implement the necessary changes.  The guidelines and the framework are in place; the question is whether there is the political will to implement them.  The toing and froing on the decision to hold a referendum has not helped to convince the public that the Government is serious about acting.  I ask the Government to commit to holding the referendum so that progress can be made and so we can be confident that it recognises the problems that exist and is willing to tackle them.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Ryan report and on the urgent need to support abused children and children at risk generally.  Before going into the details of the report, it is important to focus on our overall objective, namely, the protection of children.  They are the priority.  We have heard much talk and waffle in recent days on this issues, but what is needed is action.  We need people within the system who genuinely care and who will deliver on their civic duties.  The blame game might look and sound good on television and radio, but what is needed is people who will deliver supports and services to survivors of child abuse.  If everybody did his or her job professionally with a caring attitude, many of these problems would not have arisen in the first place.  That is the reality on the ground for these children.Early intervention is crucial for protecting children at risk.  I know from first-hand experience as my parents were foster parents and made a positive and successful intervention to save and assist children.  Let me commend and thank the foster parents of the 5,130 children who are accommodated in a family setting.  They are providing a great service to the State and to the children of the State.  I also commend and thank the teachers, the home-school liaison officers, the SNAs and child care workers who go considerably beyond the call of duty in assisting children at risk.  That is what I call patriotism of the highest order.The Minister of State referred to key phrases like Children First, standards and future management of the child protection services.  I fully support that position and I urge all Members of the House not to play politics and support the implementation of these recommendations.  After all, this debate needs to be about action plans and delivering services to children on the ground — they are the focus.Another important point not covered so far in this debate is the consequence of doing nothing or failing children.  If we do not intervene early, we have damaged and hurt children on their way to Mountjoy in the future.  Let us not expect the child to be normal if he or she is in an abusive family or care situation where violence, abuse and drugs are the norm.  Troubled children become troubled teenagers and later adults on the way to prison or early death.  That is all part of the reality in today's debate.Early intervention is the way forward and for the economists it saves money in the future, in the educational services, health services and prisons.  At this point I pay tribute to the great John Lonergan, the now retired governor of Mountjoy Prison, for his efforts over the years trying to save people and create a caring environment — against public opinion many a time.  I well remember one of his talks to me and a group of teachers in disadvantaged schools.  He inspired us to work hard and care for our pupils so that they would not end up in Mountjoy Prison.  That is the kind of inspired leadership we need as part of today's debate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, should listen to such people, the people on the ground and the common sense foster parents so that we can have a quality caring service for all children at risk in this society.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Last June, when I had the opportunity to speak on the occasion of the publication of the Ryan report on child abuse, I referred to the failure of the many institutions to care for our young people.  I also referred to the child abuse in this country as one of the darkest moments in our history.  It was our reign of terror, our holocaust, our killing fields.  Abuse is a term that should never be associated with childhood nor should terms such as suicide, drug addiction or unlawful killings.  Childhood is about fun and laughter, and growing, learning and developing.  It is a time when the adults in a child's life are there to protect and support, and not to degrade, humiliate or ignore.It is ironic that we discuss the implementation of the Ryan report on a day when thousands of young people are beginning their junior and leaving certificate examinations.  They are looking forward to their summer holidays and college or careers as the case may be.  I am very conscious of those young people, such as the late Daniel McAnaspie, who did not and now will never get that chance.  I am conscious of many young people who at this moment are living in appalling living conditions and are deprived of their rights.  I also refer to those foreign national young people who have disappeared from our system and the trafficking of those people also.  We have a system of moving foreign national young people at the age 18 from their current address and from their current state of education.Another irony is that in a time of plenty, our so-called Celtic tiger, so much could have gone into services for vulnerable young people, but it was obviously not a priority at that stage.  Accountability is the in word at this stage and I welcome it.  It is right that all institutions be accountable.  Children in care has become a paradox, a contradiction in terms because so many people who ended up in the care system were not being cared for.  However, I acknowledge the work of social workers, youth leaders and teachers who went the extra mile in looking after vulnerable children.  I believe the Minister of State is committed to the care of children and I urge him to do what is best for those vulnerable and marginalised young people.  We have had enough reports and implementation is now paramount.  Actions speak louder than words.
#JoeBehan	unknown-#JoeBehan-party	unknown-#JoeBehan-dob	unknown-#JoeBehan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I reiterate my support for and solidarity with the victims of physical, sexual and emotional abuse catalogued in the Ryan report.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is sincerely committed and deeply conscious of his duty to ensure that the Ryan report recommendations are enacted comprehensively and speedily.  I am sure we all wish him every success in this extremely important work.It might be tempting to believe the Ryan report refers exclusively to the past, which would be a fatal mistake.  The catalogue of children's broken lives contained in the report should serve as a stark reminder that unless we are vigilant now in 2010 to the dangers children face today, the same mistakes will again be made by those of us who have the responsibility to ensure the safety of the nation's children.  That is why we must as a matter of urgency debate in the most detailed and comprehensive way the question of whether the Health Service Executive is a fit body to oversee our child protection and welfare system.  I note the Minister of State stated that he remains convinced it is and I call on him and the Government to think again on this matter.  Many respected people involved in child welfare would appear at a minimum to have serious doubts about the ability of the HSE as an organisation to ensure the safety and welfare of children and young people in the State.  It is time we discussed the matter in the House.  We should have an honest, open and constructive debate about possible alternative ways to deliver on our responsibilities to the children and young people of the nation.I fully appreciate and acknowledge the commitment, dedication and professionalism of the thousands of individual HSE staff members who day after day work tirelessly to ensure the safety and welfare of the children and young people in their care.  We should obviously hear their views also.  It is time to reassess the capacity of the Health Service Executive to fulfil the task it has been given by the people.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I thank all the Deputies for their contributions and I will reply to the best extent I can to them.  Naturally, as there was some repetition, if I miss out on anybody, I might have dealt with it in a previous context.Deputy Shatter was highly political in his contribution, not untypically, in claiming that nothing had changed over the course of the past 13 years.  He tried to attribute that exclusively to the Government.  Of course so much has changed.  It has almost entirely changed and is unrecognisable from 13 years ago, but there remain core difficulties that continue to need to be addressed.  What has changed is remarkable.  We could take the issue of institutional abuse and the manner in which redress and the commission of inquiry has managed to tackle that, the manner in which the Murphy commission has tackled diocesan abuse and other issues that are ongoing.  For example, the Deputy insinuates himself into initiating the inquiries into child deaths.  If he reads the implementation plan — I suspect he probably did not do so before this debate — he will see that I recommended that HIQA set up the guidance that now underpins all future inquiries into child deaths and provide us with a national standard and a systematic way of inquiring into child deaths and reporting on them.  I asked HIQA to do that and it has done so.  That is completed and is one of the important things we do.  The only occasion when members of the public get to look at these kinds of issues is in the context of a crisis.In fairness, I believe Deputy Finian McGrath really hit the nail on the head.  He was the only Deputy to speak about early intervention.  We can talk all we like about the deaths, the high-level issues and the stuff in the newspapers, but one will never get widespread front-page headline news about the success of early intervention.  He spoke about foster parents who are intervening.  They are described by Geoffrey Shannon as "ordinary people doing extraordinary things."We should start thinking and applying the mind of the Oireachtas to how we are to support early intervention.  We should have the Whips calling for debates about how this will work and how all those in the education sector, whether the National Education Welfare Board, the National Educational Psychological Service, youth justice, all those working in youth diversion programmes and in youth work, can direct themselves at working on early intervention so that we do not have these problems.  We should ensure that people like Daniel McAnaspie can be identified at a much earlier stage and be tackled earnestly by people who have the professional expertise, the will and the desire to make a change in these lives.  We never have that debate in the Oireachtas and it is unfortunate we do not turn our minds to those things because when the Oireachtas turns its mind to something, it can effect change.Deputy Jan O'Sullivan had specific queries about money and whether the analogy with Professor Keane was worth making.  Professor Keane was allocated new money for cancer care, not the existing budget, and the same is envisaged in this case, although I will need to develop this in more detail.  The €15 million in the December 2010 budget is the kind of money.  The new person will provide leadership at national director level to put through the various road maps that have been designed for business process, knowledge management strategy and with regard to the PA Consulting report on management.  Any new money in that regard will be assigned to this person.The Deputy is correct in saying that child protection is more complicated.  Perhaps because it is more nuanced, it requires human interaction and judgments that are extremely difficult.  Unlike surgery, one is trying to make a decision as to whether a child should be taken into care on a Friday evening.  The social worker has to balance the risk of leaving the child with the family or take him or her into care.  This is a very difficult choice and our social workers do this on a daily basis.  They need to know that if they take the risk of leaving a child with a slightly dysfunctional family, that there will not be a strident and shrill media reaction that will condemn social workers for making decisions that are very difficult in difficult circumstances.  However, the Oireachtas does not have that discussion either, about how society shares the risk and empowers social workers to make these tough decisions and to try to put the resources into these families, by early intervention, by providing supports in the community to families who are struggling.With regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's points about the Saving Childhood Ryan campaign, we are on target to achieve almost everything she read out.  The one area where I concede we have not made sufficient progress is with regard to the review of section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 dealing with homeless children.  I acknowledge that, but on every other count, we are making progress on those issues.  In answer to her question as to whether the figures are commensurate with other countries, I am unable to conclude whether that is true.  The independent review group, whose members are Geoffrey Shannon and Norah Gibbons, will turn its mind to whether we are in unusual territory in this area.  We cannot come to any conclusions on this point and this will be part of the report to be furnished and laid before this House before the end of the year.The Deputy also said there should be a full Cabinet Minister responsible for this area.  I will address this issue once and for all by saying that I am at Cabinet.  I do not have a vote but there has never been a vote so I do not see what other steps can be taken in that regard.  I have sufficient position to ensure that the priority afforded to this area is acted upon.Deputy Ó Caoláin raised a number of issues.  He and other speakers referred to a figure of 1,200 social workers.  I do not believe this will solve our problems.  I have academic papers which suggest it can cause problems.  I can share this paper with Deputy Ó Caoláin.  It relates to another jurisdiction where the number of social workers was doubled but this simply doubled the number of suspected cases, none of them substantiated to a greater extent than had been the case previously.  The system is simply flooded with reporting.  For example, there are failures in Dublin north-central and in Dublin north-west but there are no failures in Dublin north which has neither extra social workers nor extra resources.  It is probably a case of better management there.  This is the question we have to ask.  We should forget about 1,200 social workers because it will not happen.  The 200 social workers recruited this year and a further 70 next year will allow us to achieve the basic targets we need to ensure we have allocated social workers.  We have care plans that are regularly reviewed and assessments of foster carers.The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007, allowed that the in camera rule would be relaxed.  Any barrister, solicitor or a person appointed by me, can do a Carol Coulter-style inquiry into District Court judgments and decisions in the area of child care to provide us with a better assessment.  I am giving active consideration to this provision.  This was also a recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, which reported last February, that a proper study should be undertaken of the type of information coming from the District Court in order to inform public policy.The Government established HIQA and empowered it to collect files and this is what is happening for the first time.  This is a substantial change and now we know where the failures are.  HIQA is investigating the files and finding the deficits.  I do not wish to make a political point but this Government empowered HIQA.  If the Government is to have to take a pasting on some other issues, at least we can take credit for the fact that we put the organisation in the position that it could lift the rug and find out what was going on.  I acknowledge there have been failures in record-keeping and this is not acceptable but we did not know this before.  Mr. Justice Ryan brought it to our attention with regard to institutions and it is very regrettable that it continues to be the case.I am unable to go into detail on all the other issues raised.  Deputy Naughten has raised the question of separated children seeking asylum.  As he will know from the implementation plan, our core target is to close the remaining hostels towards the end of December this year.  Three hostels have already been closed and the others are being inspected.The Government is doing its best on the implementation plan which contains an extremely ambitious set of targets.  Together with reforms in the HSE to which I referred in my opening comments, they provide hope.  The Oireachtas needs to turn its attention to how there can be intervention at an earlier level in people's lives, whether through justice, through the health area, through speech and language therapy.  Studies of the lives of those involved in the criminal justice system have shown evidence of speech and language delay.  This causes such people to disassociate from schooling and there is a compounding effect throughout their lives.  More work and discussion about this area will mean better outcomes for our children.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I indicated before the adjournment of this Bill last week that Sinn Féin would oppose it, uniquely, of all those who contributed.  We are even more determined in our opposition this week.  In the meantime, the management of the HSE, which is given more responsibilities in this Bill, has been exposed yet again as grossly incompetent and unfit to run a health service.  It should not be forgotten that the HSE is a creature of this Fianna Fáil-led Government which set it up. The Government tries to hide behind it but central to HSE failures is the disastrous health policy of this Government.Yesterday, due to the bravery of Melissa and Michael Redmond in speaking out, we learned of major flaws in prenatal care in this State.  It has shaken the confidence of women in that care system and very understandably so.  This is a terrible development because so many good people work in that system and provide excellent care.  Management at the Lourdes hospital in Drogheda and in the HSE must be held accountable for the litany of failures that have come to light as a result of this family speaking out.The internal hospital report, which was leaked to the media, should be published in full.  I seek a confirmation from the Minister in respect of that today.  The report exposes bad clinical practice, outdated and inadequate equipment, lack of guidelines on scanning, no permanent trained staff attached to the early pregnancy unit and no written guidelines for early pregnancy problems.Where was the oversight and responsibility of hospital and HSE management in allowing this to develop and continue?  Both levels of management failed miserably yet again.  How widespread is this problem now that we know of similar cases in Galway and Louth?  How many more cases will present over the next several days?At hospital, regional and State level, the HSE has proved to be a disaster.  It needs to be replaced with community health partnerships that will be truly accountable, a development Sinn Féin sees as essential in a reformed health service.Where is the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, in all of this?  More important, where is she today?  We have not heard a peep out of her about this situation.  She treats the people with the same contempt as she treats this Dáil.  This week's sitting, in which we cannot raise this matter other than under this Bill which was earlier demonstrated at the commencement of business at 2.30 p.m., is a complete farce.  I have no doubt the Government's current cutbacks will only make it worse and create further tragedies or near tragedies.  The embargo on public sector recruitment is putting ever greater pressure on staff, thus increasing the danger of misdiagnosis.At the core of this is a culture of refusing to listen to patients.  That is also at the core of another scandal, one which has received little attention but which I raised last week when I appealed to the Minister for Health and Children to intervene in the attempts by the HSE to evict elderly people from their home at Loughloe House in Athlone.Last week, I pointed out two patients had died since the HSE's closure announcement of the home on 6 May.  Since then, I have to report that another patient passed away in the early hours of yesterday morning in Mullingar hospital.  Relatives and staff are in no doubt that the stress caused by pressure to move out of Loughloe House was the key factor in their untimely deaths.  Two other residents had heart attacks and another man had a stroke.Six people have now been hospitalised, three fatally, in one month.  There should be an independent investigation into the methods used by the HSE to relocate residents.  As I put on the record last week, some residents were threatened with the street if they talked to media or public representatives.  Others threatened with the door if they refused to take another bed offered to them by the HSE.I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to communicate on my behalf, and that of a collective of concerned Deputies of all opinion including Government backbenchers, to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, her need to directly intervene and stand down the HSE's disgraceful methods of relocating residents.  As Minister for Health and Children she has a duty of care for all residents of Loughloe House and elsewhere.  I urge lessons be learned from the Loughloe House tragedy to ensure the same mistakes are not repeated.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I welcome the introduction of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, the main purpose of which is the dissolution of the board of St. Luke's Hospital and the transfer of the hospital's employees, assets and liabilities to the HSE.  While a welcome development, it must be noted St. Luke's has in the past provided an outstanding oncology service.  When it was the only hospital in the country treating cancer patients, much good work was done there.  I recall many times being on to the hospital on behalf of patients from the west waiting for treatment.  The staff at the hospital were second to none.  I pay tribute to the work they did in difficult times in catering for the whole country.  After this legislation is enacted, I am sure the hospital will continue to perform this outstanding work.Great work is being done by the national cancer control programme.  Its head, Professor Tom Keane, has done an outstanding job in health care management against all kinds of political, medical, vested interests' and community opposition.  While I accept all of us were involved to a degree because we want to protect our own patch, the necessary changes Tom Keane brought about were essential to providing quality cancer treatment facilities across the country.For the first time, funding has been increased to required levels.  In current economic circumstances, an additional €20 million in funding for cancer care this year is quite adequate.  When Professor Keane took up his position, he complimented the quality of the staff involved in cancer care, saying that Ireland is lucky to have a large cadre of well-trained clinicians, nurses, therapists and technicians skilled in oncology.  All the oncologists I have met in Ireland usually returned from having been trained in some of the best cancer care centres in the world.  The centre of excellence at University College Hospital, Galway, has one of the finest teams of cancer care specialists in the world, many of whom trained in the United States and elsewhere.The work done in all centres of excellence across the country must be acknowledged.  Reductions in waiting times are being addressed in an effective way for the first time.  HIQA standards require all eight designated centres see 95% of urgent patients within two weeks and 95% of non-urgent patients within 12 weeks.  The most recent data demonstrates all urgent cases in St. Vincent's and St. James's hospitals are seen within two weeks.  The overall number of deaths from cancer has been reduced by 10%.Survival rates for breast cancer have improved to 77.1% for women diagnosed from 2000 to 2004 compared to 72.5% for women diagnosed between 1994 and 1999.  The pace in improvement of breast cancer treatment is the fastest in the OECD.  The BreastCheck programme, which aims to reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women aged between 50 and 64 years of age, has been rolled out nationally.  We had a long and tortuous campaign to get BreastCheck rolled out in the west and south west.  It took much longer to roll it out there than in the rest of the country.  BreastCheck is of the highest quality internationally and it is available in every county throughout the country.  Since it started, some 600,000 mammograms have been carried out on women between the ages of 50 and 64 years.The question of treatment of prostate cancer has been slow to be rolled out.  Figures from the national cancer registry show that prostate cancer is the commonest form of cancer diagnosis in men, accounting for 29% of cases.  The stark figures behind the percentages are that on average every year more than 2,400 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 540 die from the disease.  The national cancer programme is putting in place rapid access diagnostic clinics for prostate cancer in each of the eight designated centres.  I am pleased that to date clinics have opened in St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway.  Two further clinics in Beaumont and St. Vincent's hospitals are due to open before the end of the year and the remaining four will open in 2010.  Prevention and early detection are key factors in the national cancer control strategy.  As yet, there is insufficient evidence to support a population based screening programme for prostate cancer.  The Department of Health and Children and the national cancer screening service are keeping under review emerging evidence about prostate cancer screening, including the results of randomised trials which are being conducted internationally.Lung cancer is a very significant problem here.  It is the biggest cause of cancer death in men.  In 2006, the latest year for which we have figures, some 964 men died from lung cancer.  In the same year, 585 men died from colorectal cancer and 543 died from prostate cancer.  Rapid access diagnostic clinics are now open in Dublin and this year will see the opening of a rapid access clinic in Galway.  Unlike other types of cancer, there is evidence to support screening for lung cancer.  In Ireland, 40% of all cases receive no specific cancer treatment because the disease is so advanced.I refer to cervical cancer.  Approximately 250 to 300 cases per year are diagnosed and there are between 70 to 100 deaths.  In September 2008, the Government rolled out the national cervical screening programme, CervicalCheck, which has the potential to significantly reduce incidence of death from cervical cancer over time.  The vaccine will be offered free of charge this year for approximately 30,000 girls now in their first year of secondary school.  This is the same group of girls that would have received the vaccine under previous plans in 2009.  The reason the programme is now possible is that vaccine companies have offered substantially better prices for Ireland and an innovative tender process conducted in recent weeks by the HSE has resulted in a more affordable cost to the Exchequer.The colorectal screening programme has two great benefits: early detection of cancer, improving treatment outcomes, and the detection of pre-cancerous growths.  Colorectal cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and women in Ireland and approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed every year while approximately 100 die from the disease.Rectal cancer is a terrible disease and if the surgery is not carried out correctly one's chances of cure are permanently compromised.  One interesting statistic is that there were 58 general surgeons, some of whom were rectal cancer trained, operating on five cases or less in any one year and some 17 surgeons were involved in only one case per year.  Consequently, surgery is being moved to the eight hospitals and the plan is to proceed in two cases.  All smaller hospitals will cease performing rectal surgery as of 1 January leaving us with the centres of excellence performing this difficult type of cancer surgery.The appointment of the new head of cancer care, Dr. Susan O'Reilly, is very welcome.  A native of Wales and trained in Trinity College Dublin, she has done a wonderful job in the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver.  I have no doubt but that she will continue the very good work done by Professor Keane.Cancer is probably an example of how we need to change in this country, how we need to stop with everyone looking for a hospital on their doorstep and how the medics involved need to change and be prepared to take initiatives.  Cancer in Ireland is our success story.  Let us hope that in other areas we can move on to repeat that success.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I thank Deputy Fahey for sharing time.  I welcome the Bill.  It affords me opportunity to speak on several issues relating to health.  As Deputy Fahey stated, St. Luke's Hospital, which this Bill is about more or less, is very near and dear to all of us.  We all have relatives attending St. Luke's Hospital from home.  We visit there on a regular basis to see and visit constituents.The changes envisaged under the Bill will help overall cancer services in the country.  The cancer services in the eight centres are welcome.  In this regard, people from Wexford generally go to Waterford.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware, from a Wexford hospital point of view we have been involved in services that have gone from Wexford to Waterford.  We have fully supported some of the transfer of services from Wexford because we recognise that the centres of excellence are very important.  However, we have no wish to see the downgrading of hospitals.  We have been battling for some time in respect of Wexford hospital on this reconfiguration trail.  Some of the services in Wexford are very near and dear to the hearts of the people of Wexford and we hope they will not be transferred to Waterford or other hospitals but remain in Wexford.I point out to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, that recently we held a public meeting in Wexford which was attended by between 6,000 or 7,000 people, or perhaps more.  That shows the grá for the hospital in Wexford not only in the town, but in County Wexford.  One must take into account that Wexford stretches up to Arklow on the Wicklow border and if many of the services are transferred out of Wexford to Waterford it would be a long journey from the Wicklow border to Waterford for those affected.The people of Wexford call for the maintenance of services such as the accident and emergency service on a 24 hour basis, which is very important to a country that already has a population of 140,000.  If one includes the summer months, given that Wexford is a holiday county, the population is increased by a further 40,000 to 50,000 people.  At certain times there may be approximately 200,000 people in Country Wexford.  It is very important that the Minister of State takes the message to the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the HSE that we will not lightly accept any undermining of Wexford hospital.  We will fight the battle to ensure we have adequate and proper services for the people of Wexford.  We are united on a political front on this issue and it is very important that the HSE and the Minister for Health and Children listen to what we say.  Wexford has the population to justify a hospital of high quality such as Wexford hospital in the area of cancer services.In 1984 I had a bowel operation.  I always pay tribute to the consultant who treated me.  Dr. Paddy McKiernan, who is now retired, diagnosed the problem at the time.  I had a substantial amount of the bowel removed but I am here to tell the tale.  As I recall, there were five people in the ward at the time and I am the only one now alive.  I was the eldest of the five.  Detection of cancer ailments is very important.  The new system of cancer services throughout the country in the eight centres is very welcome.  As Deputy Fahey pointed out, the goals of the national cancer control programme are better cancer prevention, detection and survival through a national service based on evidence and best practice.  Under the programme, there are four designated cancer control networks and eight cancer centres nationally, the transfer of all breast cancer diagnostic and surgical services to the eight cancer centres only plus an outreach service in Letterkenny and the establishment of rapid access clinics to enhance access to early diagnosis and multi-disciplinary decision-making for prostate and lung cancers, which are among the most common cancers in Irish people.It is essential that we continue to send the message about the importance of getting prostate cancer check-ups.  Men are not inclined to go for such check-ups as often as they should and as a result, it is often too late when they do.  We all have friends and relations who have gone for early check-ups, have had prostate cancer detected, have been treated and are well and out and about again.  It is important we send the message loud and clear that people should go immediately to their doctor if there is any sign of prostate problems so that it is diagnosed and they get the treatment required, which is very successful.The St. Senan's action group from Enniscorthy had a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, today.  Enniscorthy is my home town and that of Deputy Paul Kehoe.  A cross-party Oireachtas group has been encouraging the Minister of State to provide what was agreed a number of years ago with the then Minister of State, Tim O'Malley, which was that St. Senan's psychiatric hospital in Enniscorthy would close.  We have no problem with that because for the past ten to 12 years the nursing staff, the administrative staff and the consultants have been providing outreach services throughout County Wexford for people in that old building which dates back to the 1800s.We, in County Wexford, want an acute admissions unit, which was promised under A Vision for Change and which we expected to be delivered under it.  In March 2010, it was revealed that this situation might be about to change and that the people who need acute services would have to go to Waterford.  Waterford is not the centre of the universe for health services as far as I, other Members from Wexford or the St. Senan's action group are concerned.  It is very important that the service is provided in the county, as promised.  It is a long way from the Wicklow border to Waterford.  The acute centre in Waterford caters for approximately 40 patients but we have 40 patients at any one time in County Wexford.  There is no way Waterford will be able to provide the psychiatric services for the people of Wexford.I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, for meeting the action group today.  He listened very carefully to what we said.  We are looking for nothing more or nothing less than what was promised in 2007 by the then Minister that an acute admissions unit would be provided in Wexford.  The suggestion at that time was that it would be provided at Wexford General Hospital.  If it must be located there, then so be it but we want that service provided in the county.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill but I am disappointed that the Minister is not present for the debate.  It would be fitting that the Minister would see fit to appear in the House to take this legislation given its important and far-reaching ramifications for the health service in the future.  It is important it is noted that the Minister did not see fit to come to the House.The purpose of this Bill is the dissolution of the board of St. Luke's hospital and the transfer of staff in the hospital and the hospital's assets and liabilities to the HSE.  I take the opportunity to express some degree of concern at that development.  It is well-recorded that politicians and the public have almost lost all confidence in the Health Service Executive.  It is difficult to have confidence in that body.The original concept of the HSE was a good one.  The aspirations of the Minister and the Government in establishing it were well-intentioned but the objective of eliminating bureaucracy and the parochial element associated with the old-style, traditional health boards was not achieved.  What replaced the traditional health boards is essentially an ever-expanding and pretty frightening monster, namely, the HSE.What we have been left with is a complete absence of the streamlining of services.  We have an inaccessible, a confusing and an often frightening system which people shudder at the thought of interacting or interfacing with.  We have some very old and well-known problems with over-staffing, excessive administration and with an absence, or at least a very severe shortage, of front line services.  These problems are acute and are growing by the day.  There is no clarity about the division of workload within the HSE.  There is a hugely demoralised workforce within the health service.From my experience of the HSE, the delivery of health services is getting worse.  I say that with a heavy heart because it is essential to provide a quality service in which people can have confidence.  However, that has not been my experience.  To call it a fiasco is a serious understatement but the fiasco about which we heard in recent days in regard to the ultrasound which went wrong in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is simply symptomatic of deep and ingrained problems in the health service.  I know that from my experience of dealing with constituents and from the experience of my family members.  My uncle contracted MRSA in a hospital in Louth and died as a result.  My father contracted MRSA in another public hospital in a different part of the country and was severely debilitated as a result.  I am not unique in that there are few people and few families who have not been touched by the ongoing problems throughout our health care system, if one could call it that.It is time the Minister stood up and was counted in terms of tackling the bureaucracy and the systemic problems in the HSE.  I would be the first to acknowledge that the Minister set out with good intentions, with an agenda to reform the health service and that she did so in good faith.  She is a politician for whom I have a huge degree of respect and she is a competent and capable politician.  It was her intention to try to effect and drive change within the health service but she soon realised that would not be possible for a variety of reasons.  They include the intransigent work practices within the health service and, more crucially from the Minister's point of view, the resistance from back bench Government Deputies who will protect the status quo at all costs and resist any sight or sign of change or meaningful reform within the health service.  It is not the case that the Minister lacks the drive or intent to effect change and achieve reforms, but rather that she is constrained by the main Government party, which has been in power for too long and does not want, or have any enthusiasm for reform or change.  That is a sad situation, the legacy of which, unfortunately, we will have to live with for many years to come as it will take years to solve the endemic problems within the HSE.In contrast to the HSE, St. Luke's Hospital, otherwise known as "The Haven in Rathgar", is a beacon, a shining light, in the administrative labyrinth that is the health services here.  Since 1954, when it was formally established, St. Luke's has provided the best quality of care for its patients and the best possible services to cancer patients from all over the country.  Every family has been touched in some way by St. Luke's Hospital.  Virtually every family has had some family member or friend attend St. Luke's at some point.  Yet, St. Luke's is to cease operation in 2014.  It is all very well to point to expert reports, expert opinion and the most cutting edge of medical advice, but it is difficult to explain to even the most intelligent human beings why the Government wants to dismantle one of the few public hospitals that functions and does its job with aplomb and replace it with a subsumed and submerged cancer service that will be provided via  St. James’s Hospital.  The latter does not rank as one of the top hospitals in terms of hygiene, services available or its ethos and environment.St. Luke's has been consistently rated as one of the top, one, two or three hospitals in the country on ratemyhospital.ie.  Its rating is not scientific but it matters because it is the view of patients.  They take the trouble to go on-line, complete surveys and judge the service they have received.  It is the patients and their family members who have selected St. Luke’s and held it up as a beacon in the HSE health service quagmire.We must acknowledge the reality.  We have to take account of expert opinion and advice.  Between 2005 and 2007 more than 27,000 new cases of cancer were diagnosed every year.  Our population has grown quite rapidly and, unfortunately, in tandem with that the number of cases of cancer patients presenting has increased dramatically.  During the 1990s and the early years of this decade Ireland fell way behind in terms of dealing with the new developments and advancement in cancer treatment.  We now rank as one of the worst countries in terms of having a national plan to deal with cancer care.  That is the reason I welcome the national plan for radiation oncology.  It is necessary and important that we do everything in our power to implement it.  I recognise the Minister's commitment to that and her ambition to implement it and, in so far as it is possible, we all have a duty to respect that and to work with it.  It is an ambitious plan, which I sincerely hope — I genuinely mean that — will deliver better and improved cancer treatment facilities and care for patients throughout the country.  It is imperative that I acknowledge that the strategy has been devised by some of the top medical experts, some of the most eminent cancer specialists not only in Ireland but from further afield.  I would not pretend to second guess these medical experts when it comes to identifying medical need.  I also would not be so bold as to second guess them in terms of outlining the types of streamlined services that are required to tackle the shortfall in radiation oncology services here.  It is important that we, as politicians, examine needs and the best possible strategy to tackle cancer on a national basis and in an integrated fashion.  That is the onus on us and we cannot afford to be populist in that regard.I also understand that radiation oncology must be integrated with other cancer treatments.  Essentially, radiation must be integrated with surgical and medical oncology.  In essence, that is not happening in St. Luke's.  I understand this is the most pressing reason for the decision to relocate radiation services from St. Luke's and to bring them under auspices of St. James's Hospital.In that context, it is important to remind the Minister of commitments made by her predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Martin, in 2003.  He said:. . . that the ethos and strengths of St. Luke's must remain as key drivers nationally.  How best to ensure this happens will be a key objective of mine.  In the meantime, I am fully committed to ensuring that the excellent standards of care at St. Luke's continue to be supported.The Minister, Deputy Harney, in 2005 committed that "arrangements to ensure the continuity of St. Luke's expertise and ethos in the service" would be maintained.  I am confused as to how exactly that ethos will be maintained within the precincts of St. James's Hospital.  I have no confidence that the ethos and the quality and the level of care, to which people have become accustomed and have come to expect, in St. Luke's will be maintained or that the dignity afforded to cancer patients there will be carried through and replicated under the auspices of St. James's Hospital.  I do not have any confidence that will happen.  I would like some assurances on that.  That is the reason I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Harney, is not present.  I want to hear from her and I hope in her reply to this debate on Second Stage she will address this issue because we have no clarity on it.  I have been raising the issue of St. Luke's in this Chamber since I was elected to it and prior to that I raised it through engagement with patients and campaigners from and in support of St. Luke's.Over and over we requested assurances and guarantees from the Department, the Minister and the HSE regarding how the level of care can be maintained and how people can have confidence in the HSE to deliver that level of care and they have not been provided.  The aspiration was set out by the former Minister, Deputy Martin, followed by the current Minister.  They both proclaimed they were committed to delivering and maintaining this ethos but they have outlined nowhere how it is expected that can or will be achieved.St. Luke's Hospital is set in just over 18 acres of beautiful landscaped gardens in Rathgar.  It was always the objective of the patrons of the hospital that it would be a place of refuge, peace and tranquility where people from different parts of the country and south Dublin who were battling for their lives could access the best medical care, compassionate care and be afforded the greatest dignity while undergoing hugely stressful radiation, chemotherapy and other treatments.  That is the unique element of the hospital, which marks it out from all the other public hospitals in the State.  It is something for which people have a deep affinity and that is why there is such outrage of the prospect of the hospital's closure.  It is also why many people, including me, are concerned about the proposed closure.There are strong medical arguments in favour of moving the hospital's services lock, stock and barrel to St. James's Hospital but it is conceivable that the special conditions available to patients in St. Luke's Hospital, including the peace, tranquility and solace, will be lost forever.  These conditions have a healing power in their own right and that is not hocus-pocus.  Strength of will and of mind is an essential element in healing.  It is not simply about medical treatments; it is also about the psychological and we cannot afford to lose that element of the healing process as well.While the oncology service may well have to be relocated to St. James's Hospital, there is a strong case for retaining St. Luke's Hospital for recovery, rehabilitation and respite care.  The time has come, particularly in light of this legislation, for the Minister to outline her vision for the site in Rathgar and for the input of the hospital in the long-term provision of health services for the city of Dublin.  I plead with her not only to maintain this unique hospital for the delivery of cancer care or some other form of care but to integrate and maintain it as an essential part of the health services in the city and the country.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Few people will object to the Bill but it gives us an opportunity to give great consideration to how cancer services are being reorganised.  I am a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, as is the Acting Chairman, and I have been impressed by Professor Tom Keane.  I am not a medical person but, from the first day I saw him, I was extremely impressed with the way he went about his business.  I fully appreciate, as Deputy Creighton said, that there will always be tensions in the provision of cancer care and other Members will be much more vocal about how the national cancer strategy did not suit their areas.  However, the concept of eight centres of excellence was right.We are fortunate in my constituency that there is a centre of excellent in UCHG in Galway city but if I happened to live in counties Donegal or Sligo, I would argue it is a long way to travel for treatment.  I have been in the House quite a while and hundreds of people from east Galway and the west have had to travel to St. Lukes Hospital.  I have been in the hospital — thankfully as a visitor only — on many an occasion.  I met these people on trains and buses as they traipsed up and down to the west, with some doing a return journey on the same day having received treatment.  What is happening now is heaven on earth compared with what people had to do in days gone by.  It is bad enough to be fighting for one's life.  One of my great dreads is that cancer will cross my path or that of somebody close to me but the statistics show that one has to assume it will happen sooner or later.  I do not have time to go into the statistics but, for whatever reason, while our population is increasing, the numbers of people dying from cancer is also increasing.  I acknowledge that because of early detection and better systems of treatment, people are alive now who would not have survived ten or 20 years ago.The public will buy into the concept of the centres of excellence but when one considers what Professor Keane and his team did in a relatively short time, it was a major shake-up for an organisation such as the HSE.  I only hope in the next ten years that what happened with cancer care will be replicated in many other areas of the health service.  One of the reasons for this is that Professor Keane was able to get health professionals on side from the beginning.  There was no shortage of bickering, which is part and parcel of the world we live in but we are lucky many of our consultants have been trained all over the world and they came back here to work.  Once they got into this system, it appeared they then knew their expertise, which is acclaimed worldwide, could be delivered on to benefit patients and it certainly appears to be working.The cancer unit in Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, was closed because it did not deal with sufficient cases.  Since it was only 30 or 40 miles away, it was transferred into the new centre of excellence at UCH Galway.  One hopes the withdrawal of that type of service, which will affect all areas of the county, will be compensated for.  When I refer to a new image for the HSE I hope it will be able to deliver as regards hospitals such as Portiuncula.  We know they will not be doing open heart surgery or treating cancer in future, although it is silly to believe that an important albeit small hospital could not perform these procedures.  It is significant what they can do, however, because of the physical traffic going through a place such as Galway, which believe me is one of the busiest places on the face of the earth.  One nearly has to park half a mile away from UCH in a housing estate if one wants to visit a patient.  Nonetheless, there are obviously many procedures being done in that hospital that could, perhaps, be performed more efficiently in Ballinasloe.  I am calling for a redoubling of efforts in this regard.For whatever reason the HSE is finding it extraordinarily difficult to redirect, where appropriate, what is being done in UCH to a smaller hospital such as Portiuncula, in order to allow it to fine tune its efficiencies as a centre of excellence for many other procedures.  Take rectal cancer, which is an enormous problem.  I fully accept that will be treated in the various centres of excellence.  However, there are so many things that the smaller hospitals could and should be doing, if only the Minister, the HSE and everyone concerned would switch engines on this and let people see what could and should be done.This would remove a great deal of the frustration and anger that is being expressed throughout the country, with people saying their local hospitals are being closed by stealth.  I am not a medical person, but I believe these local hospitals will be badly needed before all this is finished.  They have the expertise in areas such as accident and emergency, maternity etc.  Given what has happened in UCH Galway, which will rightly be a centre of excellence for other things as well, we certainly would not need to take our eye off the ball as far as primary care is concerned, and need hospitals such as Portiuncula.I have a fundamental problem with Government as regards the roll out of BreastCheck, and with the HSE.  Thankfully, it has now happened and it is in operation in every county, perhaps with one or two exceptions.  However, given that in Ireland over the last ten years there was money hand over fist and where, in many instances, the Government and its agencies did not know what to do with it, I could never understand why it took so long to roll out BreastCheck.  It is enormously important and the results will show in the future that because it was rolled out, even at this late stage, it will certainly save many lives.  I believe, however, that many women have died unnecessarily over the last five to ten years because BreastCheck was not in place.Prostate cancer is an enormous issue all over the country.  One of the reasons it has such a grip on men is that, for whatever reason, they do not seem to want to see a doctor as readily as women might.  That is changing, but nonetheless men are slow to present.  There should be no reason for this, but that is the position.  Doctors tell me that men really need to become incentivised to do this promptly.  I believe some 2,500 men were found to have prostate cancer last year, and 500 to 600 died.  This is a significant number and it is getting worse.I hope the HSE, in whatever way it can, through a PR or information campaign perhaps, will get the message across to men everywhere to test for prostate cancer.  It is the most important thing they can do.  For some strange reason an enormous percentage of men refuse to do that to this day, and we cannot blame the Minister and the HSE for that.  However, we must create an environment whereby men will want to do that.  I have no doubt that with the centres of excellence now swinging into action, a major job will be done on that particular cancer.Lung cancer is another major challenge, and some 800 people die from this every year.  I find this hard to understand given what the Government and the public have done as regards non-smoking areas etc.  There is a major trend, however, among young people, particularly girls, towards wanting to take up smoking and that obviously will have enormous effects on their lives in years to come.I pay tribute to St. Luke's on behalf of the many people from the west who have attended there over the years.  One could say it had an unusual effect on many people, while one cannot expect someone to get excited by the fact he or she has been diagnosed with cancer.  Certainly, one could not get excited at the prospect of having to drive 200 miles to a hospital among strange surroundings.  Many of those people would have had nobody belonging to them in Dublin, and this was therefore a source of enormous strain and anguish for them at that point in their lives.  However, because of the way they were treated when they were admitted to St. Luke's, almost everybody I know was extremely grateful for the great dignity, humanity and professionalism extended to them.  I hope this ethos, which has been referred to on a number of occasions here, will be continue in St. Luke's and I have no reason to believe it will not.Finally, I understand that Dr. Susan O'Reilly is taking over from Professor Keane.  I wish her well.  Her job is as big as the one Professor Keane had to face on the day he started.  This job is only quarter done.  Some people might say the high profile element is done, and that may well be, but there are enormous elements to be addressed under the cancer-oncology structure.  I hope everything goes well for her.  She has the experience and the research track record and I understand she is a formidable person.  From a personal viewpoint I wish her well.More generally, as regards cancer, I must take my hat off to the hospice organisations around the country for the wonderful job they do for people who are terminally ill and living out their lives in great dignity because of the support they are getting.  I am thinking of places such as the Galway Hospice Foundation, which has done so much with so many people.  It is a testament to people's opinion of it that most hospices were started on the basis of voluntary contributions.  Some of the best voluntary efforts I have ever seen have been to establish and to procure funding for the hospice centres.  People perceive this, now they have been up and running for many years.  It is terrible to think that one may be obliged to use them.  However, that is how life is and for those who know that medical science cannot do any more for them and who wish to live out their lives with dignity and respect, it is great to think there are men and women who dedicate their entire lives to helping such people.  It must be a great source of satisfaction for families to know their loved ones are being so well looked after.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, to the Chamber and acknowledge the pending meeting with representatives from the Duchenne muscular dystrophy group.  I have just been informed that a delegation from that group will meet the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and I acknowledge the Minister of State's ongoing involvement.  I have been highlighting this issue with the Minister of State on a regular basis, both inside and outside the House.At the outset, I affirm Fine Gael's support for this Bill, which serves to further implement the national cancer strategy that was first established in 1996 by a Fine Gael Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I wish to pick up on a few points raised by Deputy Paul Connaughton and obviously there are swings and roundabouts in respect of centres of excellence.  As a Galway representative, Deputy Connaughton highlighted the positive aspect of Galway being a radiotherapy centre for the west.  However, when employing hindsight and when extrapolating on all the reasons Ireland entered a phase of what one might call the adoption of international best practice, I believe there will be a fundamental analysis of the mistakes made here when we took international best practice as a winning formula not simply for health, but for many other sectors.  I do not believe one can compare like with like and I refer in particular to Professor Tom Keane as head of the national cancer strategy.  One cannot compare the Canadian experience and health model to the model in Ireland because we do not have a similar type of public transportation infrastructure.  Obviously, I allude to the position in County Donegal, in which cancer patients must rely on paramedics to go to Dublin and must engage in five-hour trips in the back of an ambulance.  When comparing like with like, international best practice may be a misnomer.Ireland's number of consultant radiation oncologists per million citizens is the lowest in western Europe.  Each consultant supervises a case load four times larger than those suggested in a number of international guidelines published in the mid-1990s.  A total of 319,599 Irish citizens were diagnosed with cancer between 1994 and 2007, of whom 11,102 were patients from County Donegal.  A 41% increase in the number of cancers is expected between 1994 and 2015, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer.  There will be a major increase in the number of patients with the more common adult cancers that require radiation oncology treatment such as breast, prostate, lung and non-melanoma skin cancers.As I noted earlier, 11,102 Donegal residents were diagnosed with different forms of cancer between 1994 and 2007, out of a total of more than 319,000 Irish citizens who were similarly diagnosed during that time.  I have extrapolated a few figures from the National Cancer Registry and have compared the results for a few different counties to six seats in the Dáil.  A total of 897 patients in County Donegal were diagnosed with lung cancer, compared to 798 in County Kildare.  There were 1,127 Donegal prostate cancer diagnoses, compared to 1,098 in County Kerry.  A total of 204 leukaemia cases were detected in County Donegal, versus a comparable figure of 140 in County Meath.  An obvious trend emerges in this respect.The reason I have extrapolated these figures is because of the anecdotal evidence I encounter every time I go to a wake in County Donegal.  I attended a wake in my native parish last weekend at which the son-in-law of a man who had just passed away from cancer asked why more people from County Donegal are in St. Luke's Hospital than from anywhere else.  While this is anecdotal evidence, it must be investigated.  The Department should investigate this issue because it is a question on the lips of every citizen in County Donegal.  When one visits St. Luke's Hospital, one will find statistics to prove that more patients from County Donegal go through its doors than from any other county in Ireland.  It is a worrying statistic and is a trend that is highlighted in the figures from the National Cancer Registry.  There is anecdotal evidence in every parish in County Donegal and the Department must investigate it.  People speculate that it could be a result of the outfall from Chernobyl.  Obviously the issue of diet is raised but people in Donegal do not eat any different foods than the rest of the country.  Consequently, this issue should be investigated and I call publicly on the Department of Health and Children to investigate this serious issue in County Donegal.The national cancer strategy is imperfect and I refer to concern that none of the eight centres of excellence will be situated north of the Dublin-Galway line.  Moreover, there are demographic arguments for a centre of excellence north of this line.  I note the view expressed last week by Professor John Crown, head of cancer services at St. Vincent's Hospital, who stated last week that having four centres in Dublin and none in the north west is crazy.  The cross-Border organisation Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, has informed me that a commitment exists to consider the radiotherapy services provided in the north west.  However, a few questions arise therefrom.  What is the current position on a north-west arrangement?  Second, will the respective Ministers, Deputy Harney and Mr. McGimpsey MLA, sign the agreement for a radiation unit to serve the north west in Altnagelvin Area Hospital?  If so, when and on what date?  In the ongoing absence of a radiation unit, will the Minister guarantee that Donegal patients will continue to be afforded the opportunity of going to St. Luke's, to Belfast or to Galway?  The key question on the lips of Donegal residents and of my constituents in Donegal North-East is whether there will be equal access.  If a radiotherapy model based in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, County Derry, is agreed to, will there be equal access for the good citizens of County Donegal?  As for ongoing work at Letterkenny General Hospital, the new medical assessment unit and an accident and emergency unit are under construction at present.  However, fear also exists in respect of the downgrading of services at this hospital and I ask the Minister of State to allay such fears.Medical experts advise that the closure of St. Luke's Hospital is desirable and Fine Gael accepts that by 2014, it will not be operating as a cancer treatment hospital.  However, due to the high numbers of its residents who attend it, County Donegal unfortunately has a special relationship with St. Luke's Hospital.  The hospital has always sent a consultant to Donegal once a fortnight for consultations with cancer outpatients.  Previous speakers have referred to the unique culture at St. Luke's Hospital.  Psychosomatic medicine is an interdisciplinary medical field and it is impossible to quantify its effects.  Consequently, while one bows to medical expertise when considering oncology treatment, one must rely on what one hears, experiences and knows when addressing psychosomatic considerations.  Although the hospital is in the middle of the city, it gives calmness to its patients and their visitors.  Its buildings, staff, gardens, parking facilities, medical facilities, religious features and pathways contribute to the atmosphere to which many speakers have referred.  Patients who do not need constant care stay at the Friends of St. Luke's Hospital hostel, at which their families also can stay.All Members are familiar with the prayer, "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things that I can and the wisdom to know the difference".  The lay-out of St. Luke's allows longer-term patients and their families to give newer patients and their families courage and wisdom.  The atmosphere confers serenity and acceptance.  Patients rely on one another and learn from one another.  Patients' families rely on other patients' families and the staff are patient, honest and firm.  This compares to the chaos that applies in some other hospitals.I am pleased that the proposed facility at St. James's Hospital will include the St. Luke's name.  The CEO of St. Luke's will lead the management team of the new facility.  In addition to radiation oncology expertise, the director of physics at St. Luke's, Dr. Brendan McClean, will be centrally involved in setting the specifications of the PPP for the whole network.  The chairman of St. Luke's, Mr. Padraic White, will chair an implementation oversight group to report on progress on the overall plan.  Where will outpatients and their families at St. James's be accommodated?  Outpatients of St. Vincent's and their families avail of bed and breakfast accommodation that surrounds that hospital, especially along Merrion Road.  St. James's does not have these ancillary provisions.  In 2005 the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, launched the national network for radiation oncology services.  At that launch she said:The government recognises that, as well as facing the trauma of cancer treatment, many patients have to face arduous, long journeys for radiation treatment.  This is not what anyone wants for cancer services in our country or in any region of it.  With the inclusion of Waterford and Limerick in this network, and the arrangements being made in the North West, we will be keeping patients' travel times as low as possible while delivering top quality care for patients throughout the country.With that in mind, will the Minister commit to improving the transportation system that is provided to cancer patients from the north west?  Every Monday a bus leaves Letterkenny for Dublin with oncology patients and every Friday the same bus brings patients home.  Other than that, there is a very fragmented service, to say the least.Patients whose treatments start, for example, on Tuesdays, do not have a transport service.  That needs to be addressed urgently.In recent months I came across an example of a patient from Quigley's Point in Inishowen, County Donegal, who left Letterkenny General Hospital in the back of an ambulance, accompanied by two paramedics and a nurse at 4.30 a.m. to arrive in Dublin for a 9.30 a.m. appointment.  He waited for an anaesthetist for two hours only to find out that the anaesthetist would not be turning up.  He arrived back in Letterkenny General Hospital at 8 p.m. following the return journey, which was a 15 hour round trip.  That example highlights the simple errors that could be avoided within the health system.  It is an indication that the system is not working when a man aged over 70 was required to make a 15 hour trip only to find out that an anaesthetist was unavailable.  It is evidence of a lack of care within the system in terms of getting that information to Letterkenny before the gentleman in question had to endure an arduous journey.No stopover is provided for patients en route to Dublin from Donegal.  Patients are dependent on the kindness of persons in service stations and the fact that paramedics and nurses make an extra effort and buy tea and coffee for them en route.  I heard of one gentleman whose father had to use the toilet facilities in a service station in his pyjamas and slippers at 2 a.m.   The floor of the toilet in the service station in question was wet.  What kind of system are we providing for patients in comparison with the provisions for animal welfare?

One can see new service stations being built on the M1 following the enactment of the legislation.  There is no reason for the Government not to consider small stopover centres at the mid-way point between the north west and Dublin because we will not be able to provide services in every back yard around the country and patients will require transport to centres of excellence.  We should afford people dignity if they are in a state of ill health and making arduous journeys.  Providing a stopover facility would allow them to get a cup of tea.  Such a facility would not even have to be staffed.  There is no need for extra personnel or resources.  We are talking about a stopover to which paramedics would have a key.  That is something worth considering in terms of affording dignity to patients.Deputy Connaughton referred to palliative care and the voluntary work carried out in hospices.  The models designed by voluntary groups throughout the country are a model of best practice we should examine.  We should consider the genesis of the hospice movement and the types of transportation infrastructure that were introduced on a voluntary basis.  The people on the ground know what is best.  When introducing legislation we should look at what is happening on the ground in terms of best practice rather than getting caught up in international best practice.  What is best in Finland, Sweden and Canada will not work in this country.  We have a population of more than 3.5 million and we are living in a country with poor infrastructure in terms of public transport.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate which allows for discussion of subjects beyond the scope of the Bill which provides for the dissolution of St. Luke's Hospital and other significant amendments to various Acts within the health area.Professor Keane has done extremely good work in this area.  We should accept that the identification of the eight centres of excellence predated his arrival.  If one is seriously ill, one wishes to get the best treatment.  Centres of excellence allow for a significant throughput of people, the upgrading of skills on a regular basis and the availability of multidisciplinary teams to ensure that patients get the most appropriate and best treatment.  One only gets one opportunity to address a health issue and it is important that one is treated in the quickest, most efficient and effective way by those who have the required professional skills and equipment available.County Westmeath is above the Dublin to Galway axis but we have a good road infrastructure to bring patients to Dublin and Tullamore.  In the same way as the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, I have no qualms about travelling to Tullamore if that is designated as the centre of excellence for the people of Westmeath.  What is important is to get the best and most effective services for patients in the area.  However, an issue arises in the north west and it would be churlish not to admit it.  The road infrastructure and transport networks are not up to standard.  Centres of excellence are a great idea if the infrastructure is in place but it is not feasible for people from the north west to travel to Galway and other places that are already under significant pressure in terms of admissions.  Infrastructure must be put in place in order for the proposals to work and if that is not done then difficulties will arise for patients in Donegal and Sligo in particular.One could ask why this country has been loath to take up services available elsewhere such as air ambulances to ensure that patients are transported quickly and get the appropriate treatment as soon as possible.  Surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to have such services based around the country.  They are important in the context of ensuring people suffering from neurological complaints or difficulties get to Beaumont Hospital where the top neurosurgeons are available to look after them as soon as possible or to facilitate the transfer of cancer patients for treatment.  We must try to broaden our horizons in this regard in that we must ensure people are not isolated from centres of excellence.  This area should have been examined far more assiduously to ensure the needs of people in the north west would be catered for much more comprehensively than they have been.It will be no surprise to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to know I will refer to the debacle on the Midlands Regional Hospital, Mullingar, an extremely important hospital in terms of the treatment of a significant population, amounting to 120,000.  It serves the expanding population in Longford and Westmeath.  A commitment was made in the mid-1980s that when Longford hospital closed, the one in Mullingar would become the focal point for this very significant geographical area.  It has grown.In 1993, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, commenced phase 2A, and Deputy Noonan was Minister for Health and Children when it was completed in May 1997.  Something happened thereafter that has never been explained and it has caused great concern and wonderment among the populations of Longford and Westmeath.  They wonder why the phase 2B process, which had already been costed and taken on board in terms of value for money, which issue has been addressed in various reports issued today, was not completed and why the four-storey building built under phase 2A was left unused and covered in the droppings of crows and blackbirds for many years.  It had almost become defaced.  People were wondering for many years why it was built and left there, particularly because significant public moneys were invested therein.  The people's expectations were legitimate in all respects due to the fact that they are entitled to the best facilities available.  The people of Longford and Westmeath also pay their taxes and were entitled to the best facilities.  The project was left on the back burner and subject to snail's-pace development.  There was a degree of tardiness.There was always suspicion over why the project was slowed down.  People asked whether there was a political spoke put in the wheel that slowed it down.  It did not progress with the rapidity it warranted, particularly because a significant element of the building had already been put in place.  From a value-for-money perspective, it should have proceeded apace and should not have been sidelined.  There should not have been obfuscation or delaying.I have no qualms about other hospitals receiving their fair share.  Like the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, we are very proud to see the orthopaedic and ear, nose and throat facilities in Tullamore hospital.  There are excellent consultants, nurses and other staff in that hospital doing excellent work.  The hospital covers the Minister of State's area.  He is probably a bit closer to it than I am.  It is excellent and we accept and applaud it.  The hospital needed modernisation also and it is not begrudged that.  The politics of begrudgery does not come into play and has no place in respect of health; however, the politics of ensuring we get our fair share comes into play.  I was sent here to articulate that view on behalf of the people of Longford-Westmeath and make no apology for doing so.  This is the people's forum in which I can make their case.The snail became slower in respect of phase 2B.  The phase was divided into stages, with phase one involving a rescheduling that was to be completed in 2008, having commenced in October 2006.  The completion was to result in an increase in the bed complement from 215 to 244 beds.  I acknowledge that there were additional moneys for the refurbishment of the existing wards, the medical surgical ward at level 0 and a delivery-gynaecology ward at level 2.  Wards were to be fitted out, including a new paediatric ward on level 0, a new day surgery-gynaecology ward on level 1, a new obstetric ward on level 2 and a new medical ward, incorporating an acute stroke unit, on level 3.  Stage one was to see "the existing paediatric and obstetric wards in line with SARI guidelines to provide a surgical ward on level 1 and a medical ward and palliative care unit on level 3".  That was excellent.Work was proceeding very well and phase 2B2 was brought into play.  Then the whole project became subject to independent cost-benefit analyses.  We all knew the analyses should recommend that the work proceed.  The project, which was the most over-analysed, over-evaluated and over-scrutinised project ever to take place in Ireland, was then referred to the hospital capital steering committee, and formal confirmation was awaited from the committee concerning the status of this development.  How many times did a project that had been in the pipeline for 12 or 13 years have to be subject to analysis and evaluation?     Does the HSE keep evaluating in the hope it will produce a negative analysis?  That is what always made me very suspicious about the HSE.  I knew it could never get a negative analysis in regard to the hospital because the project was vital to the people of Longford-Westmeath.In the past five years, Mullingar hospital has become one of the top three in the country for efficiency and effectiveness.  Last week it was second.  What is the hosptial to do to secure its future and ensure it is in a position to provide vital services and utilities for the people of Longford and Westmeath?We are unsure of the current position.  The surgical service is only to deal with emergencies for the next two months.  The surgical facilities are very fine and the consultants are excellent.  The nurses and ambulance and paramedical services are wonderful.  One could not have better staff.  They work way beyond the call of duty and at 125% efficiency.  The people of the region wonder why what I describe is happening.  Why does the Minister have to try to save money?  One only gets one run at health.  It is the one area in which money must be spent.People ask why the surgical service is being abandoned for two and a half months.  Is it feared that it may be shifted altogether, despite the efficiency and effectiveness highlighted in all the various reports?  The people will be asking this in their thousands next Saturday on the streets of Mullingar as part of a march commencing at 2 p.m. at the hospital.  This will send a clear message to the HSE, the Government and anybody else in the corridors of power that we expect that all our facilities will be maintained and enhanced, and that additional facilities will be put in place.I do not want to bore the House with figures as this is not the appropriate forum; suffice it to say that Mullingar hospital has 185 acute beds, despite being promised up to 300.  It got €64 million or €65 million last year and €59 million this year.  There are 14 day beds.  The average length of stay in the hospital is three days, the best in the country.  The number of inpatient discharges in 2009 was 18,866, the day cases outturn was 7,235, and the number of attendances at the accident and emergency unit, which is one of the best, was 32,841.  The number in Tullamore was 5,000 fewer, at 28,241, yet there are fewer staff and beds at Mullingar hospital.The staff in the Mullingar accident and emergency unit, where I attended as a patient, are doing great work.  The nurses react to emergencies and work extremely hard to put people into beds, only to find the beds are non-existent, thus requiring them to put patients on trolleys.  The nursing staff do not want to be doing this; they want some of the 41 acute beds that were closed last November reopened.While the Minister must come into the House and give me the HSE answer, I believe what Deputy Rabbitte said some days ago, namely, that it is about time those who make the decisions should be answerable.  The buck should not always stop with the Minister, I do not subscribe to that.  Ministers come in here for me to rant at them, and I do not like doing that.  The people who make the decisions are the people who should answer.I do not believe a single word that comes from the HSE.  If it wrote to me today, I would throw the letter in the fire because I have no faith in it.  If it fools me once, I am the fool; if it tries to fool me twice I am not going to buy it.  The HSE tells me it can get 14 day beds in Mullingar but 41 acute beds are closed.  The 14 day beds are for people who need a minor surgical procedure.  Mullingar is most efficient at turning people out so the 41 beds are vital.  The nurses in accident and emergency, who are working competently and professionally as a unit, would love to see some of those beds opened.  They want additional staff.  Why should they, in spite of their efficiency, have fewer staff than comparable hospitals that do not handle as many patients?  There were 33,000 admissions to the accident and emergency department and they all received the best care and attention from expert staff.  We are concerned about these developments and we are sending a signal that we will not accept any attempt to downgrade the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar.There is talk of reconfiguration and reviews.  Do they want to waste more money reconfiguring?  We have spent millions of euro on a hospital and all we need is to put the additional staff in place and open the beds.  People do not want to go hospital, they have to go there.  That is why those facilities are important to the area.  The road structure in Mullingar is reasonable but those from north County Longford, where the road infrastructure is not as good and there is no public transport, would have to travel to Tullamore, an additional 39 kilometres.  We will not accept that when there is already an effective, efficient unit in Mullingar.  Time is of the essence when someone needs urgent treatment.  There is no reason why anyone would ever contemplate interfering with any of the hospital's facilities.Almost 3,000 children were born in the maternity unit in the hospital in 2009, with less than 23% of those by Caesarian section, one of the top results in the country.  There are excellent maternity, obstetric and paediatric facilities in the hospital, with wonderful consultants, doctors, nurses and attendants.  People work as a team providing a great service, making sure patients get the best treatment.The Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar is the only major hospital between Dublin and Sligo.  It is an important facility and it is ready to be a centre of excellence in maternity care.  There is no better place.  It could accommodate up to 5,000 children being born.  If we are going to talk about centres of excellence, Mullingar should be in the vanguard.  We should enhance the facilities there and I appeal to the Minister of State, who is doing his best in his portfolio and who is fighting his corner, to remember that the Midland Regional Hospital is one of the most effective and efficient hospitals in the country.  Services must be retained there and we are ready for enhanced additional facilities.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	168	At the outset I pay tribute to the generations of medical, surgical and nursing personnel who have served in the health services over the years.  They have given a great service, responding above and beyond the call of duty.  I served on the Eastern Health Board many years ago and it was a good way to learn about the health services.  I suggest similar experience for anyone who hopes to administer health services in the future.We had occasion to rub shoulders and, often, to rub noses and cross swords with many of those in the higher echelons of the health service.  It was to good effect, however, because it resulted in our reasoning what was best for the patient and best for the country.  It did well.  We lived through times before the boom when money was scarce but despite criticisms, patients were delivered many services at a difficult time by people who were committed to their jobs.  I pay tribute to them.I am in a minority of one in that I profoundly disagree with the proposal on St. Luke's Hospital.  No fiddling about will change my mind.  I agree with Deputies Connaughton, Creighton and McHugh, who referred to the reliance of the seriously ill on a service that stood the test of time when it was the only place available.  Staff in the institution delivered an exceptional service, above and beyond everything that was known.  Now, it appears we must move on.We hear a lot about moving on in this country for some reason but we do not seem to move very far and we do not always move upwards.  This is not a criticism of the Minister of State, who has a clear knowledge of the health service.  The institution that now handles the delivery of health services throughout this country has failed miserably.  It has failed in its mission statement and has failed to deliver services to the people.  The HSE is incapable, it is the wrong format, it does not work and it cannot work.  A single organisation cannot deliver health services to the entire country.  That is what I thought when it was set up.I opposed the abolition of the health boards.  The reason they were abolished was because politicians on them asked stupid questions about service delivery.  It was suggested that politicians on the health boards were holding up progress, suggesting that hospital services be improved in their respective areas.  This was politics and that was not allowed.  What has happened since then?  They were abolished and replaced by a body that costs five times more and is remarkably less efficient.  I cannot understand how that can happen.  We heard Deputy Penrose referring to this moments ago.  If this was comedy people would laugh about it but it is not comedy; it is a farce that so much money, time and effort has been put into providing a service for which there was great demand.  Nothing happens in the end except it slows to a crawl and eventually it will dissipate into the wind and people will forget about it.  I am totally opposed to what happened.The lack of accountability and responsibility worries me.  I do not know how we got to the situation where an elected Member of Parliament can table a question and is told the Minister has no responsibility.  With the largest single budget in this State, there must be responsibility and accountability.  I disagree with my good friend and colleague, Deputy Penrose, because I believe the Minister is responsible and must always be responsible.  The Minister brings the budget to the House and apportions it to various bodies under his or her aegis.  In order to protect the Minister, those in Government, Opposition and the institutions of the State, the Minister should at all times be accountable to the House for every cent.  That is not too hard to accept but I cannot understand what is going wrong.  The system protects Ministers.  When the question arises as to what is happening in an area or why it is happening, the answer should be readily available in order to protect the institution, the Department and the Minister.A culture has grown up in recent years of thinking that horrible, creepy politicians with long necks and red noses cannot be allowed to ask questions and run institutions because they would not understand it.

The concept of centres of excellence has been much vaunted and tossed around this country in recent times.  I do not understand what they mean by this.  What is meant by it, but not said, is that major investment will take place in eight centres throughout the country in respect of oncology and other treatment areas.  This is supposed to be cost-effective.  Why would one have investment in ordinary locations where ordinary people live in different parts of the country?  It is unthinkable to invest money in places like that.  What about the primary needs of the patient?  What about the need to deliver services to the patient where the patient lives?  Regarding the relocation of the National Children's Hospital to the northside, on which I am sure the Acting Chairman has views——

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	172	——the Minister said that when a child is ill, a parent will bring that child anywhere to get treatment.  That is not true.  The parent will bring that child to the nearest location where the treatment is available.  This is because, as Deputy Penrose said, time is of the essence.  One does not have time to be fancy footed about the matter at that stage.  If the child has an illness that requires instant treatment, the parent will bring that child to the nearest hospital.  That is where the parents hope something can be done.  If an additional five minute journey is required, the parent might not get through traffic lights, things might not happen in their favour and there may be a road stoppage or a pothole.  It is a case of minutes at this stage, as any parent who took a child on an emergency rush to the hospital will testify.  I cannot understand why we lost sight of this and the notion of centres of excellence 50 or 100 miles apart is developing.It is suggested modern transport will handle the difficulties and that we will have a helicopter service.  We had these aspirations during the Celtic tiger era when the Celtic tiger was roaming up and down the country, with evidence of its existence at every crossroads.  What did we get?  Nothing.  The health service has disappeared through the floor and hospital beds are being closed all over the country.  The current Administration, on whatever basis it is meant to stand, has failed to deliver services to the people of the country.I did not address co-location and I am surprised it has not been mentioned to any extent so far.  I do not understand where it came from and I cannot understand why existing hospitals will be sacrificed, with some sold and some demolished, in order to make way for co-location where public hospitals and private hospitals are side-by-side on the same ground.  This is duplication.  What will happen when they close half of the beds in both hospitals?  That is what will happen if it continues on the way it is now.I despair at the progress in the health sector over the past number of years.  An eminent surgeon made a comment I agree with, saying that all health institutions should be centres of excellence.  We are not supposed to have a second and third tier health service.  If we have centres of excellence and they work the way they should in theory, there will be investment in high technology and everything required in the centre of excellence.  Below that, there will be another tier.  There will be less investment and it will not be a clean hospital.  The tiles on the floor will not be cleaned or polished.  How will its third tier status be determined?  In the situation where a patient is on the road in an ambulance, the minutes count.  It will not be possible to travel 50 or 60 miles required to get to the centre of excellence.  It may not be possible to travel for hours and in this scenario a serious problem emerges.  I cannot understand why administrators do not understand this.No orthopaedic procedures are taking place in Naas General Hospital.  It shares its services with Tallaght hospital.  The theory in the beginning was that the backup services would rotate between Naas and Tallaght so that patients from the surrounding areas could travel to Naas.  An invisible hand seems to make many decisions in this country and it took control of the thinking on this matter so that the hospital services were closed down.  There is a clean-air operating theatre and the most up-to-date equipment in the world in Naas General Hospital.  It was put there for a purpose but it is unused.The sad part is that I cannot get a question answered in the House.  We can continue asking questions of the Minister to indicate the total cost of private health insurance but we cannot get an answer.  What has gone wrong with this country?  I cannot understand it.  When I came into this House, if a Deputy tabled a question of that nature and was not answered, there was uproar and the House came to a standstill the next day.  The Minister would be asked to resign because he or she failed to do a ministerial duty.  I cannot understand where we have gone wrong and how ineffective we have become.  Members on the Government and Opposition benches have allowed this to happen and we need to be alert to it at all times.The degree to which we accept second-grade decisions and a fob-off when we ask straightforward questions is our downfall.  It has declined to the point where we no longer exist or need to exist.  In that case, someone should organise a secondary parliament, the HSE parliament, where people could get elected, ask questions and get answers to questions.  They could then deliver services they were supposed to deliver in the first place.

For strategic skills or labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand.  The various schemes that give effect to such policies — Green Cards, Work Permits, Spousal and Dependant Work Permits and permits for Intra-company Transferees — were introduced following enactment of the Employment Permits Act, 2006 and came into effect on 1st February 2007.In early 2009, the Department undertook a review of employment permit arrangements to ensure their ongoing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market. As an outcome of this review, more stringent eligibility criteria were implemented for prospective new entrants to the work permit schemes from 1st June 2009 onwards.The Employment Permits Act 2006 provides immigrants with greater freedom, autonomy and control over their own employment choices by enabling workers, for the first time, to apply and re-apply for their own permit.  The Act also allows workers to change their employer after a period of a year and move to another employment in order to take advantage of better conditions or career options.It is important to retain the current arrangements which operate also to protect employees as it allows the system to trace employers who employ permit holders.  I believe that the current arrangements for moving jobs are sufficiently flexible.  A properly controlled employment permit system requires that permits be issued to a specific employee for a specific job with a specific employer.  To do otherwise would not only risk abuse of the employment permit system but would make it much more difficult to ensure that employers observed the employment rights of employees.Although employment permits are employer and location specific, it is the case that the Department currently makes best efforts to facilitate those who encounter difficult situations and who wish to change employers, with new employment permits.  In the past year, for instance, almost 1,500 new employment permits were issued in respect of employees changing to new employers.  These permit applications were issued without regard to the normal requirements of advertising the position in daily newspapers and with FÁS.Exploitation in the labour market is unacceptable and I urge all who find themselves in this position, including employees on employment permits or persons who know of such a situation, to contact the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) who will investigate these matters.  While reporting of breaches can sometimes present difficulties for employees who hold permits linked to a particular employer, I would remind the Deputy that NERA will also act on complaints made to them anonymously.The Employment Permits Act 2006 provides for regular review of Ireland's economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review on an on-going basis.

No. 220 of 2010 on 20th May, 2010.  No amendments have been made to the Regulations since and no paragraphs have been deleted from Schedule 2 of S.I. No. 220 of 2010.In June 2007, the Department established a group consisting of the six Recognised Accountancy Bodies (RABs) and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) to assist with the transposition of the Directive.  The group met at regular intervals and considered each of the Articles of the Directive in detail.  The Department undertook a formal written consultation in July 2008 in relation to Articles 9, 11 and 12 concerning optional derogations from standards of knowledge, education, competence and training for auditors.The majority of the recognised accountancy bodies were strongly of the view that to avail of the derogations provided in these Articles could seriously diminish the quality and status of the professional qualification.  In addition, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), which has responsibility for promoting adherence to high professional standards in the auditing and accountancy profession, were concerned about any dilution in educational standards relating to qualification.  In its view this could seriously compromise the integrity of the system of auditor qualification in Ireland.  In the light of these views, it was decided not to avail of these derogations and this was communicated to the group in advance of making the Regulations.I am aware that representations have been made by one of the recognised accountancy bodies and a reply will issue to this body on the issues raised as soon as possible.

All applications under these Schemes are processed in accordance with the Employment Permits Act 2006.The four types of schemes operated under the Employment Permits legislation are:Green Card SchemeThe Green Card Scheme is for occupations where there are strategically important high-level skills shortages.  The Green Card Scheme is available for an extensive list of occupations with annual salaries of €60,000 and above, and for a specified list of occupations with salaries between €30,000 and €60,000.This list of occupations has been identified after taking advice from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and is reviewed on a regular basis with its assistance.  The list includes professional and associate professional occupations where we have skill shortages, such as in the Information and Communications Technology, Health Care, Engineering, Financial Services and Research sectors.  The full list is posted on my Department's website at www.deti.ie.No labour market test is required for the Green Card applications, so advertising with FAS and the European Employment Services — EURES, and in newspapers is not necessary.  Green Cards are issued for two years initially and will normally lead to the granting of permanent or long-term residence after that.  Green Card holders are also permitted to bring their spouses and families to join them immediately.Work Permits SchemeThe second type of employment permit scheme is a Work Permit scheme.  The Work Permit is mainly for non-Green Card occupations in the €30,000 to €60,000 annual salary range.  It is only granted in exceptional circumstances for occupations with salaries below €30,000.In order to establish that vacancies which are the subject of Work Permit applications cannot be filled by Irish or other European nationals, as required by our EU `Community preference' obligations, they are the subject of a rigorous labour market needs test.  This test includes both advertising with FAS and the European Employment Services, or EURES, and in local and national newspapers.There are also a number of categories of employment for which Work Permits will not to be considered, because it is clear that they can be filled from within the EEA.  These occupations are also detailed on my Department's website.Work permits are granted initially for a period of 2 years, and then, upon renewal, for a further period of up to 3 years.Intra-Company Transfer SchemeThe Intra-Company transfer scheme is for trans-national senior management, key personnel and trainees. This facility is designed to allow multi-national companies to transfer this cohort of staff between branches in different countries, or to transfer staff with particular skills, knowledge and expertise here on a temporary basis in a start-up situation.These permits are only available for those with annual salaries above €40,000 who can clearly show that they fit into one of these three categories and who have been with the sending company for one year.These permits are for a period of two years initially, with the possibility of an extension for up to a further three years.  No labour market needs test is required in respect of Intra-Company Transfer applications.Spousal/Dependant SchemeThe fourth scheme is the Spousal/Dependant Scheme, which allows the spouses and dependants of specific Employment Permit holders who are entitled to reside here to apply for Work Permits.  This allows the spouses and dependants of work permit holders to help support their families. These applications do not require a labour market needs test and may be in respect of any occupation in the labour market.

This was achieved with the move to East Point Business Park in September 2008. Until this time, Enterprise Ireland occupied four office locations in Dublin, primarily as a result of the amalgamation of various state agencies into a single organisation over a number of years to support indigenous enterprise. From an operational perspective, occupying four separate locations in Dublin was not satisfactory for an Agency mandated to provide a range of services and expertise in a holistic manner across several critical business functions.The capital cost of moving from four Dublin based Enterprise Ireland offices to a single location at East Point amounted to €24m.  A breakdown of these costs is set out in the tabular statement.The annual cost of leasing the property is €3.55m, which includes rent and service charge.  This compares to an annual cost of €4.42m for leasing the previous locations at Merrion Hall, IPC House and a portion of Wilton House – an annual saving of €0.87m. The move to a single location also resulted in operational savings of €1m per annum.  Options are being explored regarding the disposal of the Glasnevin site, following which approximately €1m in savings will accrue – which will bring the total savings to approximately €3m per annum. The lease is for 25 years with 10 and 15 year break clauses.Enterprise Ireland leased 290 car parking spaces from the East Point Management Company.  In addition, EI procured an additional 80 spaces from Dublin Port Company — these spaces are primarily used for clients attending Enterprise Ireland events hosted at East Point.  The total cost of all spaces is €373,000 per annum.There was minimal additional staff costs associated with the move. Following a Labour Relations Commission hearing, it was agreed that each staff member would receive a small gratuity and the total cost for 620 staff amounted to €65,000 approximately.  The recommendation was in line with agreement reached for other state agency moves.€mFit-out16.2Furniture (desks, meeting rooms, audio visual equipment etc)3.7I.T Infrastructure1.8Professional Fees2.3Total24.0

The takeover company has committed to investments already planned by the company acquired and this investment programme will be implemented over the next two years.  Investment in new manufacturing technology is currently taking place and is due to be operational by the year-end in the Dublin 17 facility.   I understand that there are 963 people employed there out of a total Irish-based workforce of 1,130.  Agreements have been reached with all key employee groups at locations in Dublin and Kerry regarding a redundancy programme which will reduce the workforce by approximately 200.  This redundancy programme was announced by the company in June 2009, seven months prior to the acquisition.The Government and Enterprise Ireland have communicated to the takeover company that they are anxious to work in partnership with it to explore and capitalize on strategic opportunities that can be delivered so that growth ambitions are maximized.  Enterprise Ireland will continue the process of engaging with the takeover company in relation to building research and innovation capability, improving competitiveness and strengthening manufacturing operations.

The staffing complement of these overseas offices by geographic breakdown for March 2008, 2009 and 2010 is set out in the tabular statement below.The Public Sector Recruitment Moratorium provides that until the end of 2010, no public service post, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, nor payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade. Where vacancies arise Departments/agencies must reallocate staff or re-organise work accordingly. Any exceptions to this moratorium will require the prior sanction of the Minister for Finance.As a result of the moratorium a number of vacant posts have remained unfilled within Enterprise Ireland (EI). These vacancies are as a result of resignations and the expiration of individual contracts.Enterprise Ireland has a number of staff on fixed term contracts in overseas offices and some of these contracts are due to expire over the next two years.  The figure of 53 refers to the number of fixed term contracts which will expire over the period to end 2012. To date, sanction has been received to fill six overseas posts and these staff have been recruited to assist EI client companies operating in key overseas markets such as the UK, Europe and in Asia.  The approval to fill these posts has helped to ensure the continuity of services to client companies exporting to these key markets.  Enterprise Ireland's overseas offices play an important role in promoting Ireland and assisting their existing client companies to compete and grow their market share in overseas markets.The situation regarding contracts expiring in 2010, 2011 and 2012 is being monitored and negotiations are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to staffing levels in the context of agreeing an Employment Control Framework for my Department and its agencies to cover the period up to the end 2012.RegionOverseas OfficeMarch 2008March 2009March 2010USPalo Alto233Boston323New York111010Toronto112Brazil011UKLondon161514Glasgow311EuropeAmsterdam532Brussels455Budapest331Dusseldorf161615Madrid334Milan454Moscow443Paris888Prague664Stockholm454Warsaw666AsiaBeijing344Dubai355Guangzhou111Hong Kong222India222Korea222Kuala Lumpur122Riyadh122Shanghai122Singapore122Sydney333Tokyo555

These were private meetings held with each bank to discuss the availability of bank credit for businesses, especially SMEs.At the meetings, I raised concerns about the claims of many small businesses that some bankers were stonewalling loan requests and were not providing credit to viable enterprises. I reminded the banks of the purpose of the recapitalisation package and of the huge investment of taxpayers' money into the banks aimed at getting our economy moving again.The banks assured me that they were fully committed to supporting businesses and would meet the requirements laid down for them in the recapitalisation package of 30 March 2010.  Their message was that they were open for business and available to provide credit to viable businesses.  The two main banks had submitted plans to the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office on how they intended to meet their requirements and these plans are being reviewed.Since my meetings, there has been considerable activity and announcements by the banks relating to supports available for the business sector, particularly for SMEs.  I welcome these activities and these announcements.As I have said in the past, however, the promises and activities of the banks must be matched with specific commitments and increased lending. All viable businesses must get appropriate access to bank credit.The banks' performance in meeting their obligations under the recapitalisation scheme will be closely monitored by Government.  I want to see our banks, which have been rescued at enormous cost to the taxpayer, acting responsibly and in the best interests of small businesses so that we can create jobs in the domestic economy and advance our recovery as a nation.I will meet with the banks in the future, as necessary, to ensure that they are providing sufficient credit to the business sector.

The Study examined the situation from Dunboyne in County Meath to the sea in Dublin City, and was well underway when a flood of major proportions occurred in November 2002. The final report made a range of recommendations along its length through Dublin City, Fingal and Meath areas.In 2003 the Office of Public commenced works which were initially contained in an Interim Report, but were also included in the final report. The works included major channel works in the Dunboyne and Clonee areas, replacement of four bridges, and the construction of walls and embankments. These works were largely completed by the end of 2006.The total expenditure incurred by OPW in the Meath area amounts to approximately €6.8Million. OPW have agreed, following discussions with the Local Authority, to provide ongoing maintenance of the Scheme.

(It does not apply to mortgages). It replaces a 1987 Directive (87/102/EEC), which laid down minimum rules for consumer credit arrangements within the EU.In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, my Department is currently preparing the draft Statutory Instrument, which will transpose the Directive into Irish Law.  It is intended that the legislation will be finalised by 11th June, 2010.  The Directive will take effect from that day.I believe that the Directive enhances the strong regulatory regime underpinning consumer protection, and as such, I have decided that credit unions should be subject to its full application.However, following consultation with representatives of the Credit Union movement, I am aware that the credit unions will require some time to upgrade their systems and train staff, so that they can effect compliance with all the requirements of the Directive. Consequently, I have adopted the discretion allowed for under Article 2.5 applying limited provisions of the Directive to them until 11th December 2011, after which date, the full Directive will take effect.

The Public Service numbers for the end of the first quarter this year are currently being compiled. In functional terms, the public service is composed of the civil service, the education sector, the justice sector, the health sector, the local authorities and the non-commercial agencies.  These numbers are based on information reported to my Department and may be subject to revision as new information becomes available. Insofar as possible, the figures are broken down by functional classification within each Department. It should also be noted that a new system for monitoring public service numbers was developed and implemented in 2009. This system uses the December 2008 figures as its base. The system is still being refined and enhanced and there may be minor discontinuities in the series reflecting methodological changes and updated information regarding numbers in particular sectors.The Gross Exchequer Pay Outturns (excluding pensions) within each Vote from 2007 to 2009 are set out in Table 2. It has been broken down to subhead level.  It should be noted that the Exchequer Pay Outturn cannot be directly related to the Public Service numbers outlined in Table 1 in all cases, as the staff numbers include public servants whose pay is not in all cases funded directly by the Exchequer. The largest category of these is Local Authority employees but there are also staff in some Non-Commercial Semi-State Bodies whose pay is wholly or partially funded from the own resources of these bodies.More detailed information on the pay bill for agencies/bodies may be sought from the Ministers under whose aegis the agencies come. I should point out that general information in regard to Pay and Numbers is also set out in the Revised Estimated Volume 2010.200720082009DEPARTMENT OF THE TAOISEACHCivil Service243233210NCSSBNational

The following additional categories have been so determined: youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities.In order to give effect to this statutory provision, the surplus from the National Lottery is transferred to the Exchequer on a regular basis and is applied each year to part-fund the Exchequer allocations to a specified range of expenditure subheads across various Votes. Each year, the amount transferred to the Exchequer from the National Lottery surplus, together with details of the total Exchequer allocations to the relevant subheads are set out in Appendix 1 of the annual "Revised Estimates for Public Services".The following is a summary of the information contained at Appendix 1 of the "Revised Estimates for Public Services" for the last few years:200820092010Total Exchequer Allocation To The Subheads Part-Funded By The National Lottery€472m€435.4m€409m (Estimated)

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 31 and 33 to 35, inclusive, together.I met with the credit union representative bodies two weeks ago and again yesterday and I am listening to their concerns.  My Department, in conjunction with the Registrar of Credit Unions, is examining the scope for linking more closely the powers conferred by the new Section 35A to the framework required for implementing the new rescheduling arrangements.When the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 was published on 30 March this year, ILCU welcomed the new initiative in its press release that day stating "This new arrangement is good for our members and good for credit unions".  ILCU has since formed a different view.  That is, of course, its right.  The credit union sector is not immune to the economic downturn. It needs to be safeguarded to ensure that it can continue to provide assistance to its members in the current difficult economic climate while at the same time lending only within its capacity to do so.  The Government's intention is to facilitate relaxation of the lending limits in conjunction with appropriate regulation of the sector to achieve this objective.In my address to the ILCU Conference in April 2009, I expressed my wish to help members who are experiencing difficulty in meeting loan repayments due to unfavourable changes in their financial circumstances in the current economic environment.  I stated that any solution would be subject to the over-arching consideration that the financial position of a credit union is not undermined, the security of members' savings is maintained and accurate reporting of the financial status of a credit union is not jeopardised.  Re-scheduling of repayments to a level which is affordable to members should be possible in carefully monitored and controlled circumstances.  Of course, each credit union must fully and properly recognise arrears situations where they exist.   Where members are in difficulty, the process of facilitating them must be transparent to board members and regulators so that a credit union is never in doubt as to its own position.  This continues to be my view and the proposed amendment to Section 35 seeks to achieve the desired result.The credit union sector has been seeking relaxation of the Section 35 lending limits in an effort to facilitate borrowers who have run into difficulties in repaying their loans and need to have them rescheduled to allow for repayment over a longer period of time.  The lending limits are set in primary legislation.  Together with the measures to balance the increased flexibility in relation to rescheduling, they must apply to all credit unions in a uniform way.  However, as I have indicated above, my Department and the Registrar are exploring ways of meeting the key concerns of the representative bodies.Also, as I indicated to the House during the second stage debate on the Bill, the Registrar of Credit Unions will take a balanced and proportionate approach to the implementation of any new Section 35 requirements and he has set out for the credit union representative groups transitional arrangements and clarifications on the implementation approach.  The Registrar has already indicated that these include transitional arrangements for a 15% provisioning requirement up to 30 September 2011, trial periods, exceptions with regard to top-up loans and relaxation of the 100% provisioning requirement in respect of rescheduled loans which have missed two or more payments.  The transitional arrangements will help to ease the position for credit unions in the current financial year and the next financial year ending in September 2011. They will also allow time for credit unions to adjust to the new regime. Overall, the Registrar will take account of individual circumstances in credit unions in exercising the powers being given to him in the Bill.  I want to assure the Deputy that there is no question of a one size fits all draconian approach as has been suggested.It is not correct to say that the Registrar has the necessary powers under existing legislation.  He does not have the power to impose conditions across the sector and it would not be prudent to await the outcome of the strategic review.  While the review itself is planned to be completed by March 2011, any primary legislation arising would require some considerable further time to implement.  As I have indicated already, the credit union sector needs to be safeguarded further now to ensure that it can continue to provide assistance to its members in the current difficult economic climate while at the same time lending only within its capacity to do so.As indicated by the Registrar during his appearance on 27 May 2010 before the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, a Regulatory Impact Assessment within the meaning of the term as set out in the Better Regulation Guidelines prepared by the Department of the Taoiseach was not carried out.  However, as he also indicated, an internal analysis was carried out. This examined the level of provisions which are held against rescheduled loans.  The Registrar indicated that he will make this analysis available to the Joint Committee.  I will ask the Registrar to furnish the Deputy with a copy of any material which he provides to the Joint Committee in this regard.Contrary to suggestions now being made, there was extensive and detailed consultation on the measures now being brought forward.  Following general discussions in early 2009, the detailed views of credit union representative groups on the Section 35 issue were sought and obtained in the summer of 2009.  The provisions to be included in the requirements to be made by the Registrar have already undergone considerable adjustment following discussions between the Registrar of Credit Unions and both credit union representative bodies.Concerns have been raised in relation to the need for the Registrar of Credit Unions to consult with the representative bodies before introducing requirements.   As a matter of general practice, the Registrar consults with the credit union representative bodies before introducing regulations or requirements in relation to any aspect of credit union regulation and I understand that he intends to continue with this approach.  However, the independent position of the Registrar of Credit Unions in carrying out the duty of financial regulation is not open to question and the Registrar has the statutory powers and responsibility to introduce, if necessary without consultation, regulatory requirements in the interests of the well-being and stability of the sector.  For this good reason, a requirement for the Registrar to consult with the sector is not included in the legislation.  Neither is it appropriate to provide for an appeals mechanism.  Such a device would render the provisions ineffective and inoperable as decisions of the Registrar would become subject to constant review.There is a balance to be struck between meeting members' needs to reschedule loans and ensuring the stability of the credit union sector overall.  We are not seeking to have a credit union sector which is over-regulated.  However, we must act now in a prudent and preventative manner.  It is in the interests of every credit union in the country that the stability of the sector is safeguarded. The proposals being brought forward in connection with the Bill will achieve this fundamental aim.

The figures provided in this reply for monthly VAT receipts are estimates of the amount of VAT yield that would be generated by the volume of clearances of petrol and auto-diesel up to the end of each month. VAT returns can be made monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually depending on the nature of the registration status of a trader, and this will dictate the point in time when VAT on sales will actually be paid.It should also be noted that the VAT content of purchases of auto-diesel is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.

The National Treasury Management Agency is currently carrying out a detailed review of how the code can be adapted to the specific structure of the Agency and its associated bodies.National Asset Management AgencyIn accordance with the provisions of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, NAMA has submitted codes of practice for my approval on the conduct of officers of NAMA. This code is being reviewed. Once finalised and approved, it will be published on the NAMA website.An Post National  LotteryThe National Lottery Company, which operates the National Lottery under a licence issued by the Minister for Finance, is a subsidiary of An Post, which is under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Corporate Governance of the National Lottery Company is a matter, in the first instance, for the Board of the Company and are overseen by An Post as parent company and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as parent Department. The annual reports of the  National Lottery Company for each of the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 confirm that the Company is fully compliant with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.Anglo Irish BankThe Bank has confirmed in its annual report for 2009 that during 2009 the bank adopted the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and is working with my Department towards full compliance.Financial Services Ombudsman Council and Financial Services Ombudsman's  BureauThe  Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau have confirmed that both it  and the Financial Services Ombudsman Council are compliant with the Code of Governance of  State Bodies.Irish  Financial Services Appeals TribunalThe Financial Services Appeals Tribunal have confirmed that they have a code of conduct in place which is compliant with the Code of Governance of State Bodies.While within the current statutory provisions, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland are independent of the Minister for Finance in this area, I understand that the Board of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority have adopted codes of practice which reflect the document prepared by my Department.

To be helpful to the Deputy, I reprint that information here.FromToNumbers€€—20,00020,65820,00030,0006,43730,00040,0002,33640,00050,0001,03850,00060,00053760,00070,00037170,00080,00018180,00090,00010990,000100,00058100,000150,00069Over150,00012Total31,806The data also includes various forms of income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as being employed within the public service, e.g. those receiving fees, those on State Boards etc. On the basis of the available tax-based data it is not possible to identify and exclude income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as employed within the public service or to distinguish the earnings of employees associated with atypical work patterns. Accordingly, it is likely that the number of lower paid public servants is overstated.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.The substantial issue raised by the Deputy relates to the extent to which non-EU managers of alternative investment funds are required to register with an EU authority. Article 5 only sets down the rules for EU managers of alternative funds. However, Article 35 and a proposed new Article 39a set down the parameters for non-EU managers. I agree with the Deputy that there could be greater clarity on this issue. While it is not for me to interpret the European Parliament's intentions with regard to their proposed amendments, I think it is reasonable to assume that the proposal would require non-EU firms, which propose to sell funds within the Community, to register with the new European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).   The EP text would also require agreements between the supervisor of the non-EU fund and the competent authority of the relevant Member State and also between the supervisor of the AIFM and ESMA. This is an issue which will be the subject of further discussions between the Council, Parliament and Commission.As I have mentioned in previous PQ replies to the Deputy and others, the third country provisions of the proposed Directive were the most contentious issues of the negotiations and I have also stated that the agreement on a general approach which was reached recently at Ecofin, represents a balanced, workable approach. I still believe that the Council's text on Article 35 represents the best solution on this difficult issue.Although the proposed treatment of depositaries has been an issue of particular concern for Ireland, I would be less concerned about the proposed requirement for an alternative fund to appoint a single depositary.  This requirement is already imposed by the Financial Regulator who requires that a single entity is responsible for the safe-keeping of Irish fund assets. However, there is a critical difference insofar as the Financial Regulator permits the depositary to delegate some of its functions to others who provide custodial or safe-keeping services, subject to no dilution of the liability of the depositary.The draft measures for depositaries remain the biggest concern for Ireland. Depositaries play a critical role in protecting those who invest in funds. It is of course imperative that depositaries should be subject to rigorous regulatory standards to ensure that they fulfil their safe-keeping and custodial obligations. However, the current proposals would impose stricter requirements on depositaries for hedge funds and other alternative funds, which can only be sold to institutional or professional investors, than currently exist in relation to UCITS, which can be sold to retail investors. In my view, this makes little sense and I will continue to raise this point with our European partners in order to seek a balanced solution.

The Report and Accounts for the 15 month period to 31 December 2009 were published in March 2010, please see following link http://www.angloirishbank.com/About-Us/Reports/. In addition, the bank makes appropriate disclosures to the regulatory authorities.The Deputy will appreciate that a breakdown of the information in the manner requested is confidential and commercially sensitive and I do not have available the breakdown of the liabilities into the categories requested by the Deputy.The Deputy is no doubt aware that bondholders are covered under the Government Guarantee Scheme; this includes all liabilities for the period from 30 September 2008 to 29 September 2010.

As I indicated in my reply to PQ 22807 on 1 June, this information is taken from tables C4 and C5 of monthly reports produced by the Central Bank which shows loans to and deposits taken from customers, excluding Government and credit institutions. The latest statistics are available on the Bank's website at http://www.centralbank.ie/frame_main.asp?pg=nws%5Farticle%2Easp%3Fid%3D517&nv=nws_nav.asp.I am assuming that the reference to Irish banks in the Deputy's question comprises the retail clearing banks and the non-clearing domestic banks.As the Deputy is aware, the Retail Clearing banks are AIB, Bank of Ireland, National Irish Bank and Ulster Bank and some of their subsidiaries.  The Non-Clearing domestic banks include ACC Bank plc, Anglo Irish Bank, EBS Building Society, Irish Life and Permanent plc, Irish Nationwide Building Society, KBC Bank Ireland plc and Postbank.Table C4: Retail Clearing Credit InstitutionsTable 5: Non-Clearing with Predominantly Domestic Business Credit InstitutionsAssets: Item 5: Loans to other residentsLiabilities: Item 5: Deposits from other residentsLoans-to-Deposits RatioAssets: Item 5: Loans to other residentsLiabilities: Item 5: Deposits from other residentsLoans-to-Deposits Ratio€ million€ million€ million€ million30/05/2008228,157127,5781.79253,85299,3102.5630/06/2008235,094127,6051.84253,61299,3992.5531/07/2008235,886127,0381.86255,518101,0442.5329/08/2008237,317130,5791.82260,074105,6722.4630/09/2008237,814130,8151.82262,06499,2602.6431/10/2008248,157139,3421.78267,49489,5882.9928/11/2008253,647134,7981.88265,23987,7833.0231/12/2008251,849137,7011.83239,33482,4892.9030/01/2009250,868133,4921.88241,01879,0783.0527/02/2009251,822135,5951.86240,55179,7253.0231/03/2009249,427134,3781.86233,77676,0223.0830/04/2009248,503134,9631.84233,47776,8013.0429/05/2009248,602134,7541.84230,19477,3332.9830/06/2009249,254137,3031.82228,95177,3492.9631/07/2009246,368139,7351.76227,41176,6632.9731/08/2009246,411141,9701.74224,29876,5062.9330/09/2009243,525138,5191.76221,58076,3152.9030/10/2009241,806139,2601.74220,20277,7622.8330/11/2009243,122132,1941.84218,96076,9772.8431/12/2009242,181131,7321.84212,59476,3282.7929/01/2010240,678128,0671.88213,40175,7502.8226/02/2010245,756132,0941.86206,59374,3512.7831/03/2010242,636131,8781.84205,71472,9142.8230/04/2010241,069131,3251.83204,45271,2932.86

As it is not feasible for the Review Body to examine the chief executive posts in all of the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies on every occasion, the practice is that it examines a selection of posts for each general review.  Specific Review Body recommendations are sanctioned by the Department of Finance once they have been approved by Government.  The Department of Finance then determines the appropriate rate of remuneration for the remaining CEO posts in the non-commercial State sponsored bodies by reference to the recommendations of the posts examined.Since 1 January 2010 the Institute of Public Administration falls under the auspices of my Department. With effect from the 1 January 2010 the salary for the Director General of the Institute of Public Administration is €188,952 per annum.There are separate arrangements in the case of commercial State-sponsored bodies but there are no such bodies under the auspices of the Department of Finance.My Department also jointly sponsors the Special EU Programmes Body with the Department of Finance and Personnel of Northern Ireland as a North/South initiative. The CEO's salary scale is £61,217 — £69,020 — £76,826 — £84,630 and this salary is linked to civil service pay rates.There have been no breaches of approved arrangements in the case of these bodies.

The repayment claim was not dealt with at that time due to industrial action by the CPSU across the public sector.  However, this specific issue has now been resolved and the repayment claim has been dealt with.  A refund was issued to the taxpayer on 28 May 2010 and the records of the Revenue Commissioners indicate that the cheque was cashed on 31 May 2010.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	216	In general, public servants are liable to pay the pension-related deduction, also known as the pension levy, as legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, as amended.The pension-related deduction applies to a public servant's remuneration as a public servant, and is calculated by reference to the following annual income bands and rates:EarningsPer CentEarnings up to 15,000ExemptEarnings between 15,000 and 20,0005 per centEarnings between 20,000 and 60,00010 per centEarnings over 60,00010.5 per centA public service pension in payment is not liable to the pension-related deduction, and liability to the deduction is not age-related in any way.A person in receipt of a public service pension who takes up a public service position is liable to the pension-related deduction in respect of the remuneration for that position. However this would only be paid where that remuneration exceeded 15,000 in a full year, as earnings up to that level are exempt.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Moneylenders are covered by a range of provisions under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (the Act) including the annual licensing process and the register of licensed moneylenders system as administered by the Financial Regulator.Consumers who avail of loans from moneylenders licensed under the Act (moneylenders) are entitled to a considerable amount of information in relation to such loans. Moneylenders are required to assist consumers to understand the products on offer. This assistance has to include the method of repayment, all related interest payments, charges and the cost per €100 borrowed. Also the moneylenders are required to:disclose all the fees, costs and interest in a clear manner, andprominently indicate the high-cost nature of the loan on all loan documentation where the APR is 23% or higher.These requirements are set out in the Financial Regulator's "Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders". This Code came into full effect on 30 September 2009.In his question, the Deputy refers to the Financial Regulator's report on the Licensed Money- lending Industry which was published in March 2007.  That Report concluded that the introduction of an interest rate ceiling for moneylenders may not achieve the objectives of lowering the cost of credit for consumers. Other research findings included:—Customers of licensed moneylenders generally have a positive impression of their moneylenderThe significant majority of customers do not have difficulties making repayments to their moneylender.Customers mainly borrow from a moneylender because it is convenient, available, out of tradition or because of an established relationship with the moneylender.I would encourage consumers to shop around and consider all the difference sources of loans that are available to them including credit unions. I would also encourage them to avail of the personal finance information that is available from the National Consumer Agency. This information can be found on the website www.itsyourmoney.ie. In addition, to the information provided on this website people who are in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). MABS works with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future. It is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people.

As the Deputy is aware, the European Commission, indicated whilst the required restructuring plan was under assessment, that in line with its policy on state aid no coupon payments on the named bank's tier 1 and tier 2 capital instruments should be paid unless under a binding legal obligation to do so.Accordingly, the named bank issued to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission 198,089,847 ordinary shares in lieu of the annual €280 million cash payment on the Fund's preference share investment.  The allotment of the ordinary shares represent the amount of the preference share dividend due on the 13 May 2010 divided by the average share price in the 30 trading days prior to that date.The next coupon payment on the shares arises on 13 May 2011.  At this stage, it is not possible to say whether the State's investment will be remunerated by way of cash or the issuance of shares.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.I have provided information in an appendix on the areas that were designated for tax relief under the various area-based tax incentive schemes and where projects may have been developed, viz.:IslandsSeaside ResortsIntegrated Area Urban RenewalTown RenewalRural RenewalLiving over the ShopThe sectoral schemes, such as those for childcare facilities and nursing homes, were not restricted to designated areas and could have been developed in any part of the country. I am not in a position to provide information on the number of projects that were developed and the precise location of such projects. Many of the projects developed under the various area-based and sectoral property incentive schemes did not require approval or certification. To facilitate more efficient administration, the incentive schemes operated to a certain extent on a self-assessment basis, subject, of course, to compliance with the planning requirements of local authorities. The conditions that had to be met by a project or by a person claiming tax relief are set out in the Tax Acts and also, in some cases, in detailed guidelines. For example, student accommodation projects must meet the conditions set out in guidelines published by the Department of Education and Science. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that when all of the conditions for a particular incentive scheme have been met, claims for tax relief are made in the annual return of income submitted by taxpayers under the self-assessment system. All returns are subject to check and audit to ensure that, inter alia, any tax relief is correctly claimed. Taxpayers claiming tax relief are required to indicate the particular incentive scheme under which the relief is being claimed but not the actual project and where it is located. For these reasons, the information requested by the Deputy is not available.Similarly, I am not in a position to provide the information requested by the Deputy on the extent to which schemes have been completed in accordance with the proposals and the number and location of incomplete schemes. I would point out that the termination date for most of the schemes has already passed and future termination dates are in place for other schemes. These termination dates are the dates by which the construction or refurbishment work on a building has to be carried out if the expenditure that is attributable to that work is to qualify for tax relief.The Deputy will see from the following table that many of the schemes have a termination date of 31 July 2008. As part of the phasing out of these schemes there was a gradual reduction in the amount of expenditure that can qualify for tax relief. All of the expenditure in 2006 will qualify for relief but only 75% of the expenditure incurred during 2007 will qualify. This goes down to 50% for expenditure incurred during 2008. Where a building is not completed by 31 July 2008 the expenditure attributable to any construction or refurbishment work that takes place after this date cannot qualify for tax relief. Thus, while certain buildings in schemes with a termination date of 31 July 2008 are currently incomplete, the amount of potential tax relief that will apply on completion will not increase beyond that which applied at 31 July 2008. A similar situation applies with all of the termination dates.SchemesTermination DateUrban Renewal 199430 April 1999Temple Bar Area31 December 1999Seaside Resort31 December 1999Islands31 December 1999Customs House Dock30 June 2000Enterprise Areas31 December 2000Countrywide Refurbishment31 July 2008Urban Renewal 199931 July 2008Town Renewal31 July 2008Rural Renewal31 July 2008Multi-storey Car Parks31 July 2008Living over the Shop31 July 2008Park and Ride31 July 2008Third Level Buildings31 July 2008Qualifying Sports Injury Clinics31 July 2008Hotels continue to qualify for capital allowances but over 25 years instead of over 7 years.31 July 2008Holiday Cottages31 July 2008Student Accommodation31 July 2008Nursing Homes30 June 2010 or 30 June 2011Housing for elderly/infirm30 April 2010Convalescent Homes30 June 2010 or 30 June 2011Hospitals30 June 2010 or 30 December 2013Mental Health Centres30 June 2010 or 30 June 2011Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Scheme31 May 2013Childcare Buildings31 March 2011 or 31 March 2012 (Finance Bill 2010)Specialist Palliative Care UnitsScheme awaiting Commencement OrderInformation on the potential overall cost of the property-based incentive schemes is not available. Therefore, I am not in a position to tell the Deputy the degree to which all monies have been drawn down. I can, however, provide the Deputy with information collected by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of tax relief claimed by taxpayers in respect of the various schemes. I would point out that this information is collected at the aggregate level for a particular scheme and not in respect of individual projects and locations.

Data for 2009 cannot be provided as the tax returns for this year are yet due.It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return (Form 12) is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return (Form 11).(2) The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2007 and 2008 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies for both years. The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.(3) The figures for 2008 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the weekly cost of long-term residential care in both public and private nursing homes is published on the HSE's website. Based on this, the average cost of care per week in a private nursing home is €850 for a single room and €844 for a shared room.In the case of private nursing homes, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has to agree a price for long-term residential care with each private nursing home provider wishing to partake in the scheme. This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution.The services which fall within the scope of long-term residential care and which are covered by this agreed price are:nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,bed and board,basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living, andlaundry service.A person who avails of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme should not be charged any additional fee over and above the agreed price, except where he or she chooses to obtain additional services over and above long-term residential care services, for example, hairdressing or the delivery of daily newspapers.Existing arrangements with regard to the provision of incontinence wear free of charge to residents in public and private nursing homes also remain in place.A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. In other words, a person can continue to receive goods and services in accordance with the terms of these other schemes regardless of whether they are in a private nursing home or elsewhere.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Prior to the implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001, admissions to the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) were governed by Section 207 of the Mental Treatment Act 1945 which provided for the transfer of a person detained in a district mental hospital to the CMH, where in the opinion of the Justice of the District Court, such person had committed an offence and would, if placed on trial, be unfit to plead.  Strict legal procedures applied to admissions to the CMH; I am advised that misbehaving in a childcare institution, never constituted grounds for admission to the hospital.  The Deputy may also wish to note that there was never a crematorium in the CMH.If the Deputy has continuing concerns, I am happy to facilitate a visit to the CMH and for the Deputy to examine the admission registers.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	225	A key purpose of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is to ensure that individuals do not have to sell or re-mortgage their homes in order to meet their long-term nursing home care costs.  For this reason, the scheme provides that a person's principal residence is only taken into account in the financial assessment for their first three years in care.  It also provides that the portion of the person's contribution based on the principal residence may be deferred for the duration of their lifetime.  This is an optional element of the scheme termed the Nursing Home Loan.It is not a requirement of the scheme that a person's property be insured in order to be taken into account during the financial assessment or in order to be considered for the Nursing Home Loan.  As such, the situation referred to by the Deputy does not have implications for the long-term operation of the scheme.

Therefore the type of service to which the Deputy refers does not fall within the remit of the Fund.There is some expertise within the mental health service for the treatment of personality disorders. In addition individuals can be referred by their consultant for treatment abroad using the S2 (or E112).  The question of further developing the service here in line with ‘A Vision for Change' is a matter for the HSE.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has to agree a price for long-term residential care with each private nursing home provider wishing to partake in the scheme.

The contract must include details of the services to be provided for that resident and the fees to be charged.  It should also outline any additional health, personal and social services to be paid for over and above those included in the price agreed with the NTPF, e.g. daily newspapers, hairdressing etc.

However the circumstances of the case are known to HIQA and helped inform the Authority's Report of the investigation into the quality and safety of services and supporting arrangements provided by the Health Service Executive at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Ennis, which was published in April 2009.

Approximately 90% of public mental health services are provided at primary care level.  Expenditure on these services is not captured in the table.  Cross-national comparisons of funding are unreliable, as not all countries calculate mental health expenditure in the same way.  While the percentage of total health funding spent on mental health is of interest, the principles of efficiency and effectiveness are also important and must apply in relation to the funding allocated to mental health services.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I welcome the publication of Amnesty International Ireland's Report, Accountability in the Delivery of A Vision for Change.  I regret however that my Department did not get the opportunity to input to the Report, which would I believe, have added considerable value to the project and to the knowledge of the Report’s authors in relation to mental health service issues.My Department works on an ongoing collaborative basis with the HSE to further develop and refine performance measures across all service areas, including mental health, to ensure that they are as robust and meaningful as possible and reflect key priorities and international best practice as well as being comparable both within the EU and further afield.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	240	Many countries in the European Union operate organ donor registers.  However, the rates of deceased organ donation vary widely between Member States from 1.1 to 34.4 deceased organ donors per million of population.  Therefore, it is difficult to demonstrate the effectiveness of a donor register as a means to increasing organ donation.Ireland consistently performs above the average EU rate of organ donation.  In 2008, Ireland's annual rate was 18.4 organ donors per million of population, compared to the EU rate of 18.2.  In 2009, Ireland significantly increased its level of organ donation to 20 organ donors per million of population, which is expected to again place it above the average EU rate.Notwithstanding this performance, options to further improve organ donation should be open to consideration.  With this in mind, I agreed with the Health Service Executive, as part of its 2010 Service Plan, that it will establish an organ donation and transplantation unit within its existing national structures and resources.  This unit will provide a national focal point for reporting, monitoring and assessing organ donation and transplantation activities.  It is appropriate that these functions be carried out at a national level, on the basis of regular, comprehensive performance data provided by all the transplant centres.  This approach will provide a sound basis for evaluating performance and examining other issues related to transplantation.

The Group is composed of Ms Norah Gibbons and Mr. Geoffrey Shannon.  A third independent person of international standing will be appointed once the Group has completed an initial examination of documentation received from the HSE.  The Group has been asked to complete its work within a six months timeframe and by year end at the latest.  The Report of the Review Group will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published.  The categories of deaths to be reported on are as follows: (i) children in care; (ii) children known to the HSE child protection system; (iii) young adults (up to 21 years of age) who were in the care of the HSE in the period immediately prior to their 18th birthday or were in receipt of aftercare services under Section 45 of the Child Care Act, 1991.  These include the category identified by the Deputy.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately €63 million.The provision and repair of dentures has not been withdrawn but will be provided in cases of clinical emergency. Under the new measures the range of treatments available are being prioritised. These measures have been introduced to protect access to emergency dental care for medical card holders and to safeguard services for children and special needs groups. The HSE will monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective. The dental and oral health services currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.

The Inquiry's Report was delivered to the HSE in October 2009.  Following receipt of the report two of the parties requested that they be allowed make further submissions and these requests were granted. These submissions were made in early 2010 and were considered by the Inquiry.  I understand that the Executive is engaged in a fair procedures exercise which it intends to complete without undue delay. The question of the dissemination of the Report is a matter for the Executive, which has indicated its intention to publish it.  It is not anticipated that this legislation will be required in these circumstances.

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the HSE are making very good progress in their work to bring this important project to fruition.  The Integrated Design Team, appointed in Oct 2009, completed the concept designs for the new children's hospital and the Ambulatory & Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght in February 2010.  The tendering process for the enabling works for the ceded site on Eccles Street has commenced.  This work is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2010 subject to planning permission being secured.The HSE have indicated that the capital development cost of the hospital will be approximately €750m.  It is intended that €400m of this funding will be provided from the Exchequer for the hospital build.  The remainder will be raised from other sources, including philanthropic contributions.  To date, €21.8m has been expended on the project.  I am very pleased to note that the planning of the new hospital is proceeding on schedule and due to be operational by the end of 2014.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	262	Agencies established under the remit of my Department are required to comply with this Department's Frameworks for Corporate and Financial Governance.  The two Frameworks (one for regulatory bodies under the aegis of my Department and one for the agencies funded by the Department) are supplementary to statutory requirements and to Government approved guidelines including the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.
All Agencies meet their legal and financial obligations with regard to control, compliance and internal risk processes linked to their requirements to publish Audited Accounts.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	264	The  Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children clearly state that the Children and Family Social Services of the HSE should always be informed when a person has reasonable grounds for concern that a child may have been abused, or is being abused, or is at risk of abuse.  The ability of the Children and Family Social Services of the HSE or An Garda Síochána to assess suspicions or allegations of child abuse will depend on the amount and quality of information conveyed to them by the people reporting concerns.  It is critical that there is a clear understanding of professional and legal responsibilities with regard to confidentiality and the exchange of information.  The Children First Guidelines state that “all information regarding concern or assessment of child abuse should be shared on ‘a need to know’ basis in the interests of the child”.The Protections for Persons reporting Child Abuse Act, 1998 makes provision for the protection from civil liability of persons who have communicated child abuse ‘reasonably and in good faith' to designated officers of the HSE or to any member of An Garda Síochána.  This protection applies to organisations as well as to individuals.  This means that even if a communicated suspicion of child abuse proves unfounded, a plaintiff who took an action would have to prove that the person who communicated the concern had not acted reasonably and in good faith in making the report.I am currently finalising proposals for Government in which I will set out a framework for improved implementation of the Children First Guidelines.  The framework will take into account the position of sports clubs and other voluntary organisations working with children.  The purpose will be to ensure that the Guidelines are effectively and consistently implemented across each sector, supported by a particular focus on inspection and audit of compliance.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	275	My Department approves the remuneration of CEOs of the State-sponsored bodies under its aegis and, from time to time, notifies the bodies concerned of adjustments resulting from the terms of national pay agreements and, where applicable, recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  In January of this year, the Department conveyed detailed instructions to its non-commercial State-sponsored bodies on the application of pay reductions to Chief Executive Officers of such bodies with effect from 1 January 2010 in accordance with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 (No. 41 of 2009).My Department's agencies are required to comply with the Department's Frameworks for Corporate and Financial Governance.  The two Frameworks (one for regulatory bodies under the aegis of my Department and one for the agencies funded by the Department) are supplementary to statutory requirements and to Government approved guidelines including the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.
Specifically, the Code of Practice requires Chairpersons and Boards of all State bodies to implement Government policy in relation to the total remuneration of the Chief Executive/Managing Director.  Arrangements put in place by a relevant Department or the Department of Finance for determining and approving the remuneration of the Chief Executive/Managing Director must also be implemented and adhered to.  The review and appraisal of the degree of compliance with legislation and with requirements centrally (e.g. by Government, the Department of Fiance and my Department) is included in the objectives of an Agency's internal audit function as set out in my Department's Frameworks for Corporate and Financial Governance.Officials of my Department ensure that the Frameworks for health sector agencies are adhered to by monitoring progress on an ongoing basis.Over the past three years, my Department has dealt with two specific cases where it came to light that the ceo of an agency under its aegis was being paid a higher basic salary than the approved rate. In the first case (National Treatment Purchase Fund), the position was subsequently regularised with the approval of the Department of Finance.  In the other case (National Cancer Screening Service), the matter has yet to be brought to finality.A table outlining the salaries of the CEOs is currently being prepared and will be forwarded to the Deputy at the earliest opportunity.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	280	This year, the HSE is required to achieve a net reduction of 1,520 (or 1.4%) in its employment levels. Corresponding reductions will be required in 2011 and 2012 to achieve an overall reduction of 6,000 between March 2009 and December 2012.  These reductions are an essential and unavoidable part of the measures being taken by the Government to address the gap between revenue and expenditure.While there is provision in the HSE's Employment Control Framework for some exemptions and exceptions these are limited because of the need to achieve the required payroll savings.  The alternative would be to reduce services in order to secure the necessary expenditure reductions which I assume the Deputy would not favour.I recognise that the employment controls introduced by the Government will obviously impact on newly qualified nurses.  However, the only way to ensure we have a sustainable health service in the future is to take firm action now to address the budgetary imbalance.

The inclusion of transferred assets in the financial assessment is not a new measure.  Transferred assets were also taken into account under the Subvention Scheme which was introduced by way of Regulations in 1993 and established in primary legislation in the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Act 2007.Transferred assets are taken into account under the financial assessment using the valuation at date of transfer because this is the amount that could have been realised from the sale of the asset at the time.  The financial sustainability of the scheme is underpinned by the principle that applicants will contribute according to their means, which includes a percentage of their assets.  To allow the transfer of assets prior to application would therefore undermine the entire scheme.  The legal provision is contained in Schedule 1 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.

The 10 Harbour Authorities were not reported as being compliant.  A review completed in late 2008 considered the level of compliance with the Code of Practice as satisfactory.  It reported that deficiencies identified were being addressed and that the recent ‘Change in Tone' corporate governance initiative by the Minister had set the scene for improved standards of reporting and compliance for 2009 onwards.The Review noted that issues relating to compliance with the Code of Practice by Port Companies had been the subject of a separate audit and that issues identified were being addressed by the relevant Divisions within the Department. It further noted that the development of a standard reporting template by the Department for use by chairpersons should achieve better standards in reporting and compliance by the Port Companies.The Review reported that a delay in completing audits by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General were a serious barrier for some Bodies in meeting their reporting deadlines under the Code of Practice. The Review referenced the National Roads Authority by way of example.In September 2007 the Department reviewed if all Bodies under the Department's remit were in compliance with Paragraph 10.2 of the 2001 Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.This provision required the Chairperson of each Body to confirm, inter alia, in his or her annual report to the Minister that the Code of Practice had been adopted and was being complied with.At the same time, the Department also reviewed the position regarding the establishment of an internal audit function in the agencies as required under Section 3 of the Code of Practice.In relation to confirmation by the Chairperson, the review found that confirmation had been received in all, except two cases. In the two cases involved, a response from the relevant Division in the Department was awaited in relation to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and the Commission for Taxi Regulation regarding the compliance confirmation and the internal audit function. In relation to the internal audit function, the review noted that all Bodies had an internal audit function in place with the exception of a number of Port companies where internal audit units were not established (Drogheda, Waterford, Wicklow, Dundalk and New Ross). The review noted that these five did have an Audit Committee in place.The Review recognised that the requirement for a properly constituted internal audit function may present difficulties for some of the very small State bodies and noted that in some cases alternative approaches were being examined in consultation with the Department's Internal Audit Unit. The revised Code of Practice, published in May 2009, subsequently provided the opportunity for greater flexibility in relation to the internal function audit for smaller State Bodies.

In some cases, chief executives are on non-Hay rates. These are primarily cases where chief executives had already been on salaries higher than the Hay rates and opted not to move to a Hay contract.Chief Executives of non-commercial State companies and agencies come within the remit of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration and have been subject to the salary reductions provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act 2009.The salary scale of each Chief Executive was provided to the Deputy in response to Parliamentary Question No. 75 of 10th February 2010. These reflected the salary reductions imposed on the non-commercial State Bodies from January 2010.In relation to the commercial State companies, some Chief Executives may have taken a voluntary salary reduction in the interim.My Department is currently reviewing compliance with the current arrangements.

This project aims to identify and assess the barriers to implementing more sustainable transport patterns in Ireland. The project is being carried out in TCD, and funding from my Department for this project is €46,425.In addition to this my Department is supporting the "Irish Transport Research Network Conference" to the value of €5,000. This conference, which is hosted by UCD, includes topics such as sustainable transport and energy in transport, and will take place on August 31st and September 1st 2010.It should also be noted that section 72 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, enables the National Transport Authority to promote, engage in and fund research in relation to any of its functions.

The Red Zone was set 200ft/60 metres from (then) proposed thresholds of the runway.  However, the runway eventually constructed was 8650ft/2637metres long.I hope that this information clarifies the issue for the Deputy.

The person  concerned has visit permission which would allow her to stay in the State for no longer than 90 days from the date of last entry.  It is not clear from the question whether the person concerned wishes to be in the State for longer than would be permitted by a ‘C' visit visa.However, it is essential to note that a visa is solely a form of pre-clearance for entry into the State and the period of time which a Non EEA national may remain in the State is entirely at the discretion of the Immigration Officer at the port of entry.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

I would also add that the Tribunal has informed my Department, that in the majority of cases, the reasons for the Judicial Review relate to matters of a technical nature in relation to the processing of appeals rather than the substance of the Member's decision itself.With a view to bringing about improvements in this regard, the Tribunal has also informed my Department that a strong focus on quality decision making continues to be a core part of the ongoing training provided to members of the Tribunal.

The Minister has overall responsibility on behalf of the Government to manage the State's immigration regime.    Within that structure certain roles are carried out by Gardaí who are appointed by the Minister as Immigration Officers.  These roles include manning immigration desks at the airport, granting immigration permissions, investigation of illegal migration,  arrest and detention where necessary and executing Deportation Orders signed by the Minister.  The head of the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the District Superintendents are also responsible for the registration of foreign nationals.The Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2008 in respect of which I have indicated an intention to publish a replacement shortly, will replace almost all existing immigration legislation and the future legal relationship between the Minister and an Garda Síochána will be set out in that proposed legislation.  Since the Bill, like its predecessor, will be very detailed it is inevitable that some changes in operational procedure will be necessary.  Any such matters will be progressed during planning for implementation.  This process is already underway.  I can say however that I have no plans for fundamental operational changes in respect of the relationship between the Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

However, based on an analysis by the immigration authorities of the computerised records, the table provides the information sought by the Deputy as at 11 March 2010.  It should be noted that international students who are required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau are non-EEA students whose course of study exceeds 3 months.  These represent a minority of those coming to Ireland to study.  By far the largest cohort of international students comprises EEA nationals engaged in language courses.

Each visa application is considered on its individual merits, the onus resting with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why the visa should be granted.On joining the Visa Section, Visa Officers are provided with on the job training and support by more experienced Visa Officers in the section.  This is particularly the case in instances where matters of a more complex nature arise or no previous precedent arise.  Furthermore, Visa Officers are kept fully informed with regard to any changes of policy relating to visa matters as and when these changes are deemed necessary in the interest of public policy.While straight forward visa applications can be granted by Department of Foreign Affairs diplomatic staff working in Irish Embassies/Consulates without reference to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), the remaining applications are handled by visa officers in the INIS headquarters, Burgh Quay, Dublin and the other dedicated INIS Visa Offices in Abuja, Beijing, Cairo, London, Moscow and New Delhi.As regards visa statistics, I can inform the Deputy that my Department provides statistics to the European Migration Network and also by way of my Department's Annual Reports.  Further statistical information is provided on an ongoing basis to members of the Oireachtas and other interested bodies, where possible.  Consideration is currently being given  to the publishing of further general visa statistics on my Department's website on a regular basis.

These factors are essentially based on the type of visa sought.  Information regarding reasons for refusal can be found on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).The following are examples of cases where  it is considered that the need to undertake the course in this State is neither demonstrated nor warranted: an applicant has not outlined and/or satisfied the visa officer as regards the reasons for undertaking the particular course of study identified in the visa application.  An example of this might be where there is no clear link to a particular course — be it a change of career, work related or progressing/advancing  to the next stage of study e.g. diploma, degree or masters level an applicant has already obtained a higher level of qualification in a particular area than that from which the course of study applied for might result.  An example of this might be where an applicant holds a degree in nursing yet applies to study a FETAC level care assistant course  the course in question is readily available in the home country of the applicant and there is no reason for the applicant to travel to Ireland for the purpose  an applicant from a country where English is commonly spoken but seeks to study English in Ireland rather than in their home country.It is open to an individual who is refused a visa to submit an appeal within two months of the date of refusal.  Guidelines with regard to the appeals process are again available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).

During phase 3, Student Gardaí receive further training on mental health awareness covering the areas of schizophrenia, depression and suicide. A module on mental health awareness was delivered as part of the continuous professional development programme in 2007. A  module on mental health is included in both the Garda Negotiator and On Scene Command courses. Previous participants can be updated by way of distance learning techniques.The Garda Síochána provides updates on progress towards implementation of the recommendations on Garda Training in Chapter 15 of the "Vision for Change" report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy.In September 2009, the Garda Commissioner and the Mental Health Commission published the Report of the Joint Working Group on Mental Health Services and the Police 2009. The Working Group was established to review best practice models of cooperation between the police and mental health services with a view to making recommendations for enhanced liaison and joint working systems between An Garda Síochána and the mental health services in Ireland. The Working Group made 7 recommendations. The Garda Commissioner has already commenced work to progress the recommendation relating to Training which builds on the work already done towards implementing recommendations of "A Vision for Change".

Representations were received from the persons' legal representative asking that his Deportation Order be revoked, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). This application is under consideration at present. When a decision has been made on that application, that decision, and the consequences of that decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

The projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which, primarily, seek to divert young people who have been involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, and promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.  The projects may also work with young people who are significantly at risk of becoming involved in anti-social and /or criminal behaviour. Essentially the projects provide a resource to An Garda Síochána, and to Juvenile Liaison Officers in particular, in the implementation of the Diversion Programme as set out in Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended. There are currently 100 of these projects operating throughout the country.  Most projects are located within areas of high social deprivation.I can confirm that an application to establish a Garda Youth Diversion Project in the town in Co. Kildare specified by the Deputy is one of over thirty similar applications from across the country which have been received by the Garda Commissioner. However, the planned expansion in the number of projects beyond the existing 100 has been re- assessed in the light of the changed economic climate and, in this context, the focus is now on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the services provided. The Irish Youth Justice Service and the Garda Síochána are reviewing the effectiveness of the diversionary measures as set out under the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010. In view of the circumstances, I do not, at this stage, expect to announce any new projects in 2010.

However, I understand that Section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended by section 7 of the Road Traffic Act 2006, allows a person who has been disqualified for more than 2 years to apply to have the disqualification removed. In order to apply the person must have completed one half of the period of disqualification. The Court may, on application, confirm the period of disqualification or order the removal of the disqualification from a specified date such that the person will have served at least two thirds of the original period of disqualification.

I am satisfied generally that the law provides for appropriately lengthy sentences for the type of offences referred to by the Deputy.  Members of the judiciary are, subject only to the Constitution and that law, independent in the matter of sentencing, as they are in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions.The Courts Service Board has established a Steering Committee to plan for and provide information on sentencing.  The Committee, under the chair of Mrs Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, comprises a judge from each of the High, Circuit and District Courts and a university lecturer with expertise in sentencing law.The project, known as the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS), involves the provision of a computerised information system on sentences and other penalties imposed for criminal offences.  The system will enable a judge, by entering relevant criteria, to access information about the range of sentences and penalties imposed for various types of offences in previous cases.  This will assist any judge when considering the sentence to be imposed in an individual case.The system has been piloted in several court jurisdictions, including Dublin, Cork and Limerick Circuit Criminal Courts, the Dublin District Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The outcomes will be reviewed and assessed by judges prior to the final evaluation and establishment of a web-based system.

The table outlines funding for services relating to domestic violence provided by Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, by the Victims of Crime Office and by the Probation Service.  The funds were provided for organisations to assist them to provide support to victims of domestic violence, to raise awareness of the domestic violence problem primarily at local level and to provide intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence.The table is based on the best available information but some points need to be kept in mind in interpreting it.  The county of the funded organisation is based on the address of the organisation.  At the same time many of the organisations based in one county run programmes, and provide outreach services, in neighbouring counties. Indeed some of the organisations concerned provide a nationwide service.  In addition points need to be kept in mind in interpreting the information for the years 2006 and 2010.  In relation to 2006, it was not possible for Cosc to obtain details of amounts granted for local awareness raising in 2006 mainly because that year preceded the establishment of Cosc in 2007.  The information sought by the Deputy cannot be easily extracted from voluminous records and to do so would require the deployment of a disproportionate amount of resources. As regards 2010, Cosc's grants for local awareness raising and some domestic violence perpetrator intervention programmes cannot be included in the table because decisions have not yet been taken in relation to the grant applications for the current year.County20062007200820092010Number of projectsAmount providedNumber of projectsAmount providedNumber of projectsAmount providedNumber of projectsAmount providedNumber of projectsAmount provided(€)(€)(€)(€)(€)Carlow16,500212,165316,500315,000115,000Cavan0012,03012,5000000Clare1303,2003370,8906458,0003377,0002145,750Cork120,000428,216749,150550,500228,500Donegal118,000325,244531,500428,500215,000Dublin159,00010109,83522150,29018169,000268,500Galway001500417,0001041,000114,591Kerry121,000331,000448,000231,000130,000Kildare000013,6000000Kilkenny00142011,2300000Laois00223,600216,500223,400116546Leitrim0022,21012,0000000Limerick140,000689,782549,680460,400150,000Longford120,000121,000224,000128,000125,000Louth227,000329,140467,000643,500114,860Mayo115,000218,200525,780221,000118,000Meath249,500355,513688,300382,000120,000Monaghan120,000118,000217,500221,000113,883Offaly0000325,000335,000229,000Roscommon000011,25011,50000Sligo16,000322,082311,200117,00018,000Tipperary234,000426,238434,000338,000233,000Waterford1185,4003328,5573334,0002305,00000Wexford000013,5000000Wicklow000026,25024,00000Westmeath00110,000115,000321,000115,000TOTALS19824,600571,224,711991,498,730801,412,80024560,630

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The Oireachtas, by virtue of the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001, provides that a convicted sex offender must notify his name and current home address to the Garda Síochána within seven days of becoming subject to the notification requirements. This means that the convicted offender must notify the Garda Síochána of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Furthermore, notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Gardaí.If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more, he/she must inform the Gardaí of this fact and the address at which he/she intends to stay and also notify the Gardaí of his/her return.  I am currently looking at the possibility of reducing this seven day time period and when my consideration is completed I will be bringing my proposals to Government.As the Deputy may know the Garda Síochána has a system in place for the monitoring of all persons subject to these requirements.  The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit monitors and manages the notification provisions and maintains all information relating to persons who have obligations under the Act.  There is a nominated Garda Inspector in each Garda Division who has responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Act in their Division.  As soon as the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit is advised by a relevant authority, such as the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service or a foreign law enforcement agency, of the impending release or movement of a sex offender, this information is immediately passed to the nominated Inspector.In January 2009 I published a comprehensive discussion document on the management of sex offenders.  One of the issues raised was the question of whether the name and address of sex offenders who completed their sentences should be made public, known as Megan's Law.  Following publication of the document my Department invited comment and held a Forum to hear the views of a range of interested parties. The universal view of those who responded was that such a general approach to the publication of this type of information would be counter productive and would, in all probability,  drive sex offenders underground where they could not be monitored and where they were more likely to re-offend.  There was, however,  support for the view that in particular cases where a sex offender was not cooperating or otherwise posed a specific danger,  the Gardaí should continue to be in a position to warn those in danger. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in due course that would have the effect of allowing the Gardaí to warn individuals of a particular danger or to respond to specific requests.Apart from the notification requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, sex offenders released from prison can be subject to supervision and other restrictions. For example, Part 5 of the Act introduced a system for the supervision of sex offenders after their release from prison. Post Release Supervision Orders allow for court sanctioned supervision of offenders after their custodial sentence has expired. There are currently 40 sex offenders being supervised in the community by the Probation Service who are subject to a Court imposed Supervision Order under Part 5 of the Sex Offenders Act.  An additional protection in law is that convicted sex offenders must advise their employer or any prospective employer of their conviction if the work involves unsupervised access or contact with children or mentally impaired persons.The Deputy will also be aware that I presented the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database) Bill earlier this year. As soon as that legislation is enacted we will be in a position to start work on compiling a DNA Database which will include sex offenders.  It is not the norm to grant temporary release to sex offender prisoners.

This ensures an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.I am further informed that local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The situation will be kept under review, with primary consideration being given to the needs of residents.

This would include participants in some community employment schemes.The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives — 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009.The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase, for training placements for example.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the average processing time for valid vetting applications received at the GCVU may vary from four to five weeks in periods of lower demand to up to about 12 weeks at times when demand is particularly high.The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  An additional five persons were assigned to the Vetting Unit recently, bringing the total to 83 personnel currently assigned to the vetting unit, including six Gardaí and 77 Garda civilian personnel.  A further five additional personnel are being recruited on a temporary basis and it is intended that these persons will commence work shortly.  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.

They include enabling powers for the courts to order attachment of the earnings of a debtor spouse, to order the securing of payments to the maintenance creditor, to order the payment of lump sums and to order arrears of maintenance to be paid by instalments.While the law generally operates successfully in this area I am aware that difficulties have arisen in some cases because of the effect of a judgment of the High Court last year. The High Court judgment in that particular case had implications for sections 6 (imprisonment in the case of non-payment of debt) and 8 (imprisonment relating to non-payment of maintenance) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940. The Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 made changes in the law consequent on that judgment in accordance with legal advice.I am currently in consultation with the Attorney General with a view to developing early proposals for amendments in respect of maintenance enforcement which I hope to include in the forthcoming Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.

However, what has become known as ‘an application for leave to remain' is the submission of written representations to the Minister against the making of a Deportation Order.Any person issued with a notification of intention to deport — a so called ‘15 Day Letter' — under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) is advised, inter alia, of their entitlement to submit written representations to the Minister setting out reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against them with any representations submitted being considered by the Minister, under a variety of headings, before a final decision is taken. The ultimate decision will be that a Deportation Order is made or, where, in the Minister's view, it would not be appropriate to make a Deportation Order, leave to remain in the State will be granted.Against this background, it will be seen that there is no ready means of recording the amount of ‘leave to remain applications' that are received each year given that in every instance, regardless of whether or not written representations are submitted, each individual case must be considered under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) before a final decision is taken.Notifications of intention to deport under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) arise under two headings i.e. those of asylum origin and those of non-asylum origin with the latter category made up of persons who are illegal in the State following, for example, the expiry of a work, study or holiday visa or a work permit.  Reliable statistics are available for persons served with such a notification following the formal refusal of their asylum applications and figures for these are represented hereunder (see Table 1).  However, statistics for notifications issued to persons of non-asylum origin for the same periods are not available.  As a rule of thumb, the ratio of notifications of asylum origin to those of non-asylum origin is generally about four to one.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	352	On 11 March 2008, the Government approved the development of Phase 1 of an Irish Border Information System (IBIS).  IBIS will operate by collecting passenger information from carriers which will be screened against immigration, Garda, and other watch lists of persons of interest to agencies participating in the project.  Where a match occurs, the system will generate an alert which will be relayed to front line staff for appropriate action.  The UK is currently rolling out such a system, known as "e-Borders".A Project Development Team (PDT) has been put in place chaired by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) to scope out and progress the development of this system. The PDT comprises representatives from all the Agencies which may benefit from the advancement of the concept in this country, including An Garda Síochána, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs, Social & Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade & Employment, and Transport.  It will be a matter for the individual agencies to identify areas where IBIS can be of benefit to their operations.  The PDT has unanimously supported the development of such a system in Ireland.It is proposed to develop IBIS in two phases.  Phase 1 will initially involve the collection of Advanced Passenger Information (API) on one or two routes and matching this against one or two watch-lists.  Building on this over a two year period, the system will be rolled out in stages until all air and sea passenger journeys between Ireland and destinations outside the Common Travel Area (CTA) are captured.  During this roll-out period, Phase 2 of the project – likely to involve the capture of Passenger Name Record (PNR) information, passenger data from travel within the CTA, as well as building profiling and intelligence gathering functionality — will be explored.From the outset, our priority has been to put in place a system which would initially allow us to monitor persons of interest entering and leaving the CTA.  A vital element of this will be close cooperation and interaction with the UK e-borders system to enable both States to know if a person of interest to one State has entered or left the other.  Officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the UK Border Agency are examining ways to maximise such cooperation and interaction which would effectively ring fence the Common Travel Area and provide a basis for an entry/exit control system.The effective monitoring of persons moving within the CTA continues to present a major challenge.  Both States have confirmed that there will be no fixed controls in respect of persons travelling between North and South.  Of course I am concerned, and I know that this concern is widely shared both here and in Great Britain, that persons can exploit this absence of fixed controls to move illegally within the CTA, including for the purposes of abusing the social welfare systems of both countries.  In this regard, I would like to emphasise that the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the UK Border Agency and the British police work closely together and run regular intelligence led operations aimed at interrupting such illegal movement.  These joint operations have successfully prevented foreign nationals moving illegally between the two jurisdictions.  Officials from my Department, the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the UK Border Agency are examining ways to further build on this cooperation.Underpinning legislative provisions for IBIS are being developed at the present time and will be taken forward in the context of the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill in respect of which I have indicated an intention to publish a replacement Bill shortly.The country's economic circumstances in the last 18 months has meant that we have had to re-examine our thinking in how to bring forward this project.  We are now developing in house a prototype which will inform a tendering process for the full scale system.  Over the last number of months, officials in my Department have met with several external consultants who specialise in electronic border management as well as representatives of the airline industry to inform the development of this prototype.  My officials are also consulting on a regular basis with colleagues in the UK Border Agency in relation to the development and roll out of their e-Borders system.It is intended to develop and implement the prototype during 2010/2011 with a view to holding a tender competition for the full system soon thereafter.

The vast majority of the removals involved persons whose asylum applications were refused.Set out below are the costs, from 2005 up to 31 March 2010, of the removal of persons subject to Deportation Orders, by scheduled and charter flights. These figures include the travel costs relating to the deportees and their Garda escorts.YearCost of scheduled/commercial and charter flights€20051,663,464.4420061,517,539.192007786,334.692008927,091.0020091,069,634.002010 (1st Quarter)84,975.97The Deputy might wish to note that the figures above do not include the cost of overtime or subsistence payments for Garda escorts.My Department deports persons to non — European Economic Area (EEA) countries. To identify the ten most expensive deportations would involve a disproportionate use of resources in disaggregating those individual costs from the cost figures quoted above. During the period in question however, notwithstanding the foregoing, the single most expensive deportation involved the removal of a Ghanaian man on 11 March 2008 at a cost of €151,900. In this case, attempts to remove the man by scheduled flight were unsuccessful due to his violent reaction to his deportation. For safety reasons he was subsequently removed by charter flight.In considering the costs of deportations, the considerable expense arising from the continued presence in the State of persons who are the subject of deportation orders has to be taken into account.  These costs include social welfare costs, direct provision costs, and detention costs in certain cases.  While it is important to keep deportation costs to a minimum, not to remove persons refused permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration system.  This would leave this country open to further illegal immigration and even more expense to taxpayers.

While every effort is made to effect these orders as speedily as possible the process is regularly delayed by judicial challenges commenced by persons who are due to be deported. Evasion of deportation orders is also a factor that can lead to delays in removing people from the State.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 to 214, inclusive, together.The role of the Conflict Resolution Unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs is to support conflict resolution efforts internationally while also seeking to develop our national capacity in this area. It draws on our own experience of peacemaking and peace building and from the work of Irish Aid, while also developing a range of partnerships with relevant international organisations and NGOs. The Unit maintains close contact with Irish Aid and the Anglo-Irish Division of my Department and reflects Ireland's commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security under the UN Charter, and to respect for international law.Our engagement in Timor-Leste, in close cooperation with Irish Aid's development programme there, is designed to address key issues directly related to the risk of renewed internal conflict. Initiatives taken so far include support for an early warning and response system based in civil society, a programme on peace, remembrance and reconciliation, advice on security sector reform, and support for structured high level dialogue amongst rival leaders. President Ramos-Horta of Timor-Leste was very appreciative of Ireland's support in this area during his State visit to Ireland in February of this year.The Conflict Resolution Unit is taking the lead role in the development of Ireland's National Action Plan on UNSCR Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security. The Resolution calls for an increase in the participation of women in peacemaking and peace building processes; the protection of women and girls in armed conflict; and the incorporation of a gender perspective into peacekeeping and peace building processes. 2010 is the 10th anniversary of the resolution and the Government will have approved Ireland's National Action Plan on 1325 in time for events in New York in October to mark that anniversary. The plan is being drafted with input from civil-society and academia and is informed by an innovative cross-learning initiative which brought together women and men from three conflict-affected areas (Timor-Leste, Liberia and Ireland, North and South) working on issues relating to women, peace and security. Representatives from these regions have met three times, under the chairmanship of Ireland's Special Envoy for UNSCR 1325, Nuala O'Loan, and a report detailing the results of the process will be presented to the UN in October.Given the complexity and sensitivity of conflict resolution work, close coordination with other key agencies and governments is essential. The Conflict Resolution Unit has developed a broad network of contacts in the UN, EU and the OECD's Development Assistance Committee. It has a close working relationship with a number of Irish and international NGOs, particularly the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, Interpeace, International Alert, International Crisis Group, Crisis Management Initiative and the International Security Sector Advisory Team. I will also ensure that conflict resolution is at the heart of Ireland's Chairmanship in Office of the OSCE in 2012.In addition to this work, the Conflict Resolution Unit has launched a Research Development Initiative for academic institutions with the aim of strengthening research capacity in the area of conflict resolution in both national and international contexts. In February of this year, I renamed our conflict resolution PhD scholarship scheme in honour of the late Andrew Grene, the Irish UN Worker who died tragically in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I utterly condemn the murder of over 90 members of the Ahmadi community in Lahore, as well as the terrible injuries visited upon so many others as they worshipped in two mosques in the city on 28 May.  Nothing can justify attacks which cause such senseless carnage and destruction. On my own behalf, and on behalf of the Government, I extend my deepest sympathies to the bereaved families on their great loss.These heinous attacks bring to public attention once again the threats which exist to the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan, the discrimination they can face there and in neighbouring countries, and issues relating to other minority communities more broadly.As I mentioned in my response to previous questions in this House in relation to the Ahmadiyya community, most recently in September last, promoting religious tolerance remains a key objective of Ireland and the EU in relation to Pakistan. Bilaterally, and through the EU, we have urged the Government there to make every effort to promote effectively the rights of minorities and to improve their current conditions. In our bilateral contact with Pakistan, we have emphasized the importance of maintaining adequate protections for minorities in Pakistan.  Minority and human rights issues in Pakistan were discussed at political consultations held between Ireland and Pakistan at Political Director level in Islamabad on 10 February last.  The issue of the recent attacks has been raised with the Embassy of Pakistan and my Department will continue to discuss issues relating to minorities in its ongoing bilateral contacts with Pakistan.At EU level, the EU Council Conclusions on 28 April and 8 December 2008 reaffirmed the importance of human rights in Pakistan as a central priority for the EU.  Human rights and minority issues were discussed with Pakistan, most recently at the second EU-Pakistan Summit held in Brussels on 4 June.The Government of Pakistan has made it clear that it is committed to the protection of minorities, the promotion of religious tolerance and combating the terrorist actions of the local Taliban and other radicals.  However, it faces very serious challenges in this regard. Many hundreds of innocent Pakistani civilians from many parts of the country, from many tribal and religious groups and from all levels in society have fallen victim to terrorists. In the case of the attacks on the Ahmadi community on 28 May, I note that the Punjab wing of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan has claimed responsibility.The EU has pledged to assist the Government of Pakistan in its efforts to fight terrorism. In this context, leaders at the EU-Pakistan summit last week agreed to further strengthen cooperation between the EU and Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, both within the framework of the United Nations as well as in other relevant forums.  The EU and Pakistan also reiterated that counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing, and should be implemented in full respect of international law.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I understand that the Tent of Nations project is an initiative of a Christian Palestinian family, the Nassars, who live close to Nahaelin in Bethlehem.  This project was established in 2000 – the family own 100 acres which they were asked to evacuate in 1991 by the Israeli authorities but they contested the case in court and won on the basis of official documents that prove their ownership of the land.  The family's response to increased settlement around their property, prohibition on building themselves as well as the lack of amenities provided to them, was to construct makeshift accommodation and invite volunteers to help them farm the land in what appears to be an atmosphere of peace and environmental sustainability.These makeshift dwellings appear recently to have been legally challenged by the Israeli military authorities.  The latest media reports indicate that the Supreme Court of Israel has this week upheld the appeal by Daoud Nassar, and the Tent of Nations, to deny an order to demolish the structures on the farm until the Supreme Court takes a decision.I welcome this verdict. Deputies will be aware of my long-standing view that the continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and related policies involving demolitions of family homes and forced evictions represent a major impediment to the two-State solution.  It both prejudges the outcome of final status negotiations and undermines the fundamental viability of a Palestinian State.  I also firmly believe that it weakens the standing of moderate Palestinian leaders and plays into the hands of extremists on both sides.  Groups who advocate a peaceful resolution to the conflict should be encouraged and supported in their activities by the Israeli and Palestinian authorities and by all those in the international community working to achieve a peaceful and just resolution to the problems of the Middle East.

For the years 2006 to 2008, inclusive, confirmation of the adoption of the Code of Practice and of full compliance with it has been received from the State bodies under the aegis of my Department, with the exception of The Arts Council, Chester Beatty Library (CBL), Crawford Art Gallery Cork, National Gallery of Ireland (NGI) and National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA).In the case of CBL, this body is a public charitable trust established pursuant to the will of the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty and is under the ownership of its Board of Trustees.  As a charitable institution, it is responsible directly to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests and complies with the requirements of the Commissioners.In the case of the Crawford Art Gallery Cork, this body fell under the aegis of my Department only from 2007 during its start-up phase, and its annual accounts for 2008 remain with the Comptroller & Auditor General for examination.In the case of The Arts Council, NGI and NSCDA, I am assured that procedures have been put in place to ensure compliance with the Code of Practice.  My Department is currently in the process of receiving formal written confirmation of these assurances.With respect of Tourism Ireland, the Code of Practice does not apply to North-South bodies established pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I have received correspondence from the person referred to in the Deputy's question regarding the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall and in particular the refurbishment of the existing organ at the hall.In accordance with a decision of the Government, the project is being procured through a Design/Build/Finance/Maintain Public Private Partnership (PPP) contract.  This means that the entire project will be contracted to one consortium.  Given the size of the project it was not permitted to directly invite tenderers to participate for particular aspects of the project.  Details of the project were published in the Official Journal of the European Union (available through the etenders.ie website), as required under EU procurement regulations and interested consortia were invited to respond to the request for tenders.As part of the requirements of the project prospective teams were required to design, build and maintain a new organ and refurbish the existing organ.  The selection of organ builders to join the prospective teams was left solely to the discretion of the participating consortia.  Given the nature of PPP projects it was not permitted for the refurbishment of the existing organ to be the subject of a separate tender, indeed even if it were permitted, the cost would prohibit the State from seeking direct tenders from any company and such a call for tenders would have to be placed in the Official Journal of the European Union.I understand that staff at the National Concert Hall had a number of meetings with the person concerned and outlined the PPP process in detail to him, including the fact that no one company could be directly nominated for the project.  I am satisfied that the competition has been run in accordance with the Guidelines governing PPP projects.

Officials in my Department are currently carrying out a review to evaluate the Scheme and its operations and I hope that this process will be completed by the autumn.  On the basis of the findings of the review, I will consider the options available to me regarding the future of the Scheme.All organisations involved in the Scheme, including the Dyslexia Association of Ireland, are being consulted as part of the review process.  As the Deputies are aware, Departments are currently preparing their initial estimates for 2011.  While I cannot at this stage give a commitment to any individual organisation, I will be endeavouring to make the best possible use of the resources available, taking account of the outcome of the review under way at present.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	374	My Department approved CLÁR funding for the projects referred to by the Deputy in August 2008.  I understand that those projects represented Phase 1 of larger developments, which the local authority chose to proceed in various phases.  To date, funding has been fully drawn down for just one of the projects and I am advised that the others have yet to be completed.The particular measure under which the CLÁR funding in question is being provided was closed to new applications from August 2008 and I have had no correspondence with the local authority involved, other than in relation to the already approved projects.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in the circumstances, it is not possible to issue a letter of approval to the local authority for any funding over and above that which is already being provided.I should also point out that the CLÁR Programme seeks to facilitate the progress of projects by way of top-up funding and, accordingly, that the primary funding must, in the first place, be provided by the bodies responsible for the developments in question.

The Code was last updated in May 2009, and I can confirm to the Deputy that all State bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group have been provided with a copy of the updated Code.My Department monitors the compliance of the relevant State bodies with the Code on an ongoing basis and where issues arise these are addressed.  It may be noted that the Corporate Governance Division of my Department has developed a comprehensive checklist to assist relevant divisions across my Department in monitoring compliance levels with the Code.

A reduced grant is payable to households that have not yet achieved the required level of Irish usage and where my Department is satisfied that the required standard can be achieved within a 3-year period.In the case of the household referred to by the Deputy, a reduced grant was paid in respect of 2007/08 and 2008/09.  However, as the expected improvement had not taken place when the 2009/2010 application came to be examined, the grant was refused accordingly.This decision can be appealed and the Deputy may be assured that the application will be fully reviewed if the family writes to my Department requesting such a review.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	378	The National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 is being implemented across its five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research in line with the Government's commitment to address problem drug use in a comprehensive way.Solid progress is being made on the implementation of the various Actions of the Strategy.  One of the recent highlights was the introduction of regulations  by the Minister for Health and Children under the Misuse of Drugs Acts that make the possession and sale of a wide range of psychoactive substances illegal and subject to criminal sanctions.  In addition, legislation is being drafted by the Minister for Justice & Law Reform that will make it a criminal offence to sell or supply substances that are not prohibited under the Misuse of Drugs Act, but that have psychoactive effects on humans.An Garda Síochána and Revenue's Customs Service continue to prioritise the targeting of those involved in the supply of drugs and I congratulate them on their recent successes in this area, both nationally and abroad.Significant progress continues to be made in regard to treatment and rehabilitation services for recovering drug users.  New opiate substitution facilities, greater opportunities for detoxification and the roll-out of a comprehensive needle exchange programme across the country are among the improvements that are coming on stream.  Progress is also being made towards providing comprehensive rehabilitation services.  In that regard, my officials have recently agreed on a way forward in regard to residential rehabilitation services with the HSE and the voluntary sector.  It is envisaged that significant improvements can be achieved through interagency co-operation and comprehensive care planning for the individual clients.I will shortly be undertaking a series of meetings with a number of Ministers and various senior officials who are responsible for the implementation of different Actions of the Strategy.  In those meetings, I will again stress the need for Departments and agencies to continue to ensure that high priority is given to achieving the objectives of the Strategy.I am determined to tackle the issue of problem substance misuse over the coming years and I am confident that the Drugs Strategy will continue to facilitate this.

He was interviewed by a Social Welfare Inspector on 9 January 2009 and was requested to provide details of his 2008 income derived from self employment.Subsequent to that interview, it came to light that the person may have other means that were not disclosed to the Social Welfare Inspector and he was requested, in writing, to supply full details of these other means, along with his 2008 accounts which were yet to be furnished.  When the information requested had not been received by November 2009 his claim was returned to the Deciding Officer stating that the person had failed to disclose his means.The person concerned subsequently provided certain information in relation to his claim and his file was referred back to the Social Welfare Inspector for investigation.In the meantime there was a change in the Inspectorate personnel for the Mallow area and a new Inspector was appointed.I understand a Social Welfare Inspector will be in contact with the person concerned in the next few days regarding his means.  When the report is received a decision will be made and the person will be notified directly of the outcome.

This care and attention must be given by another person, almost all of the time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this care and attention for at least 12 months.Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the impairment or disease but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating a degree of extra care and attention required.  As such it is not possible to say in advance if a child diagnosed with autism or indeed any other condition will qualify for a payment under the scheme.  Every application is assessed by one my Department's Medical Assessors and an individual medical opinion, based on the information submitted by the applicant in support of their claim, is given in each case.  The deciding officer then makes a decision having considered the medical opinion provided and all the other information available.There has been no change in policy in relation to the Domiciliary Care Allowance and the budget available remains unchanged.

Firstly, the duration of the benefit for payable to people with 260 or more paid social insurance contributions was reduced from 15 to 12 months, for (then) current claimants with less than six months duration on the scheme, as well as all new claimants. Similarly, where the claimant had less than 260 contributions the maximum duration of benefit was reduced from 12 to 9 months for people in receipt for less than three months, as well as all new claimants.On this basis reductions in claim durations were subsequently applied entirely in accordance with the law as passed by the Oireachtas.  Accordingly, in regard to this matter, no actions were "taken without proper authority", within the meaning of section 4(2)(b)(i) of the Ombudsman Act 1980.More generally, I would point out that it is well established that the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot overcome a statutory bar and that it cannot be invoked to prevent the enactment of legislation by the Oireachtas or the implementation of legislation by the executive.

Jobseeker's allowance is listed by EU Regulation 883/2004 as a special non-contributory cash benefit and, as a result, it is paid "exclusively in the Member State in which the persons concerned reside, in accordance with its legislation".  A jobseeker's allowance customer, to retain his or her payment, is therefore required to remain in the State.Locally, however, arrangements may be made between a local office and a person on jobseeker's allowance, permitting the person to travel abroad for a job interview or short holiday.

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Social Welfare Services on the grounds of appeal be sought.  When received the appeal in question will be referred to an Appeals Officer for consideration.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

Between 2000 and 2009, overall expenditure on Child Benefit grew from just €638 million to approximately €2.5 billion per year. However, with tax revenues having fallen dramatically, we cannot afford to maintain spending at this level.It was decided in Budget 2009 to limit spending on Child Benefit by lowering the upper age limit that currently applies from 19 years to 18 years.  The impact of this measure was phased in, with payment for existing children being halved from January 2009 and payment stopping from the 18th birthday from January 2010.  Budget 2009 provided for a compensatory payment of €15 per week to be made to people receiving a social welfare payment which included an increase in respect of an 18 year old child. Further compensatory measures were also applied to the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance scheme in respect of 18 year olds.In recognition of the need to target limited available resources at persons on low incomes with children in full-time education a number of provisions have been introduced.  These include the extension of entitlement to Increase for Qualified Child, payable to social welfare recipients in respect of qualifying child dependants, to age 22 where the parent of a full-time student (including third level) is in receipt of either a long-term social welfare payment, or a short-term social welfare payment for six months or more (short-term schemes include such payments as Jobseeker's Benefit and assistance, Illness Benefit and Supplementary Welfare Allowance).  It also includes the provision of a weekly payment to low paid employees with families through the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme.  Under this scheme, a qualified child is any child under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 22 in full-time education.  This supplement is paid where a family's weekly income is below a specified amount for the family size, and is calculated at 60% of the difference between the net family income (i.e. gross pay less tax, PRSI, health contribution, superannuation) and the relevant income limit.Low income families may also be entitled to a Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, which is administered by the Health Service Executive and operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year.

This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.  The strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 April 2010 was 9,856 comprising 8,036 Army, 797 Air Corps and 1,023 Naval Service personnel.Targeted recruitment will be carried out in 2010 to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces. In this regard I have recently approved the recruitment of 40 Recruits for the Naval Service. In addition, as I have already stated, the Military Authorities will shortly advertise for some limited recruitment to the Army.  It is a matter for the Military Authorities to select candidates based on specific criteria and in accordance with Defence Force Regulations for positions in the Permanent Defence Force.The colour vision requirements for general service enlistment to the Permanent Defence Force are normal colour vision as measured by the Ishihara Method.  In relation to vision capacity the requirements are for a military visual acuity grade of 1, 2, or 3 for applications for the Army and Air Corps. For the Naval Service it is Grade 1 for applications other than for the Administrative Branch.  For the Naval Service Administrative Branch it is unaided vision not less than 6/36 in each eye and can be corrected to unaided vision of not less than 6/6 in one eye and 6/9 in the other.Grade 1 is unaided vision of not less than 6/6 in one eye and 6/9 in the other. Grade 2 is not less than either 6/12 in each eye or 6/6 in the right eye and 6/36 in the left eye. Grade 3  is not less than 6/36 in each eye and can be corrected to Grade 1.

The dispersal of personnel over an extended number of locations is a major impediment to essential collective training. It also imposes increased and unnecessary overheads on the Defence Forces in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security. The consolidation process is designed to facilitate higher training standards, while also freeing up under-utilised resources and personnel for operational duties.In the context of the 2009 Budget, the Government approved the closure of four barracks at Monaghan, Longford, Rockhill and Lifford in County Donegal, and also St. Bricin's Hospital in Dublin.  The four barracks closed at the end of January 2009.  The decision to close Lifford Military Post will not be re-considered.

There are three interlinked requirements. Firstly public bodies must, insofar as practicable, take all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities. Secondly, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, at least 3% of their employees must be people with disabilities. Finally on an annual basis public bodies must report to the statutory Monitoring Committee and to the Minister of their parent Department on the number of people with disabilities in their employment and the measures they are taking to support them in employment.A Monitoring Committee was established in 2007 to monitor compliance by local authorities and public bodies under the remit of my Department with Part 5 of the Disability Act. The members of this Monitoring Committee (including a person representative of people with disabilities) were appointed for a 3 year term and have met regularly. The Committee has reviewed employment targets to determine levels of compliance with the Government's 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities and has reported each year in relation to compliance by the local authorities and public bodies under the aegis of my Department to the National Disability Authority (NDA) and to me. For the years 2007 and 2008, 33 out of 34 local authorities were in compliance.When the Monitoring Committee reports to me on the levels of compliance for the year 2009 within the local authority sector, I will then determine the need for further regulation in this area, if any.There is a general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts across all local authorities and the overall staffing levels in the sector are to be reduced significantly by the end of 2010 in accordance with the Government's Policy on Staffing and Numbers in the Public Sector.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	421	In the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016 the Government committed to updating and more effectively enforcing the minimum standards regulations for rented houses. The final elements of the package of measures approved by the Government in 2009 to deliver on this commitment came into effect on 1 December 2009 and since that date local authorities have a strengthened regulatory framework available to them in respect of their functions regarding rented accommodation.Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. With very limited exemptions these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented accommodation and local authorities have responsibility for ensuring compliance.It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide on the specific details of its inspection arrangements. However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rented sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the report Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which makes a range of recommendations on matters relevant to inspection procedures such as identifying and targeting inspection requirements.In addition, a one day seminar entitled Standards for Rented Houses: Enforcement Practitioners' Seminar, hosted by Dublin City Council and sponsored by my Department, took place on 15 December 2009. This seminar provided an important opportunity for local authority staff involved in the enforcement of standards in rented accommodation to discuss the implementation of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 and to develop inspection performance so as to ensure effective enforcement of standards in the rented sector. On that occasion I emphasised the point that the minimum standards regulations also apply to dwellings let by local authorities and must be no less rigorously applied there than in the private rented sector.The key element in ensuring good standards of local authority housing is the performance of local authorities in relation to the maintenance and, where necessary, improvement of their housing stock. These are matters in respect of which local authorities have a significant degree of devolved responsibility and which are subject to oversight by the elected members of each individual authority.  This role was strengthened further under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, particularly in terms of the requirement placed on local authorities to prepare, and submit to the elected members for approval, Housing Services Plans addressing a wide range of quality-related issues relating to their housing stock, including their management and maintenance policies.On the more general issue of long-term regeneration my Department is committed to a multi-annual regeneration programme to help improve the lives and conditions of the communities involved. The programme is reviewed on a regular basis, including through the biannual Housing Action Plan meetings, with new projects added and additional elements of existing projects advanced, as resources permit. It is a matter for individual local authorities, in the first instance, to prioritise and manage the advancement of projects within the programme, having regard to available resources.

These actions include in the first instance an accurate quantification, classification and mapping of the various types of unfinished or unoccupied estates on a county by county basis to understand the scale and distribution of the problem.  Following completion of a pilot exercise with one local authority, a comprehensive national inventory is now under way and should be completed in the middle of the year.My Department is also preparing a best practice policy manual which aims to identify the necessary responses to ensure satisfactory outcomes in tackling difficulties on specific sites in a co-ordinated and pro-active manner.  The responses will require a range of interventions across a number of disciplines – there are issues of public safety, the provision of bonds and securities, environmental protection, building control and estate management.On the issue of promoting energy efficiency in buildings, my Department is undertaking a number of initiatives.  Proposals for amendment of Part L of the Building Regulations, to deliver the targeted 60% improvement (over 2005 requirements) in permitted energy usage and carbon emissions levels for new dwellings from 2010, will be available for public consultation shortly.  The new proposals will focus on reducing the demand for energy by improving passive measures, such as minimising heat losses by better insulation and improving airtightness to eliminate uncontrolled airflows and on meeting that reduced energy demand by using efficient heating systems and renewable energy resources.Work has also been prioritised, through the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body, to establish realisable targets for reductions in primary energy and CO2 emissions for buildings other than dwellings. A consultancy project to examine the potential for upgraded energy efficiency targets for Buildings other than Dwellings will be advertised later this year.

In accordance with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies (May 2009 edition) (paragraph 13), the Chairperson of each State body is required to furnish to the relevant Minister, in conjunction with their annual report and accounts, confirmation that the Code of Practice has been adopted and the extent to which it is being compiled with.  My Department regularly reminds agency management of the corporate governance provisions contained in both their own specific, and other, relevant legislation.  An annual meeting of my Department's Management Committee and the Chairs and Chief Executive Officers of the various agencies is convened, at which, inter alia, governance and compliance issues are discussed.There are currently 20 agencies of varying size and function operating under the Department's aegis.  In line with recent Government decisions, work is ongoing to progress the amalgamation of some of these agencies, including the Local Government Management and Computer Services Boards and a number of housing-related agencies (including the Affordable Homes Partnership and National Building Agency).The Code of Practice makes provision for certain requirements to be applied proportionately to smaller bodies.  In particular cases, the Code is considered to have a disproportionate effect on such bodies because of either the nature or scale of their activities, the resources available to them, or their governing statutes.  In other cases, some agencies within my remit have particular governing structures (e.g. tribunal structures) which differ from the conventional Board structure of state agencies.

1The LGMSB will shortly be merged with the LGCSB to form the LGMA, which will comply fully with the new Code.  Pending the enactment of the necessary legislation, both Boards have appointed the same members to their respective Boards and continue to comply with the 2001 Code.  The preparatory work being undertaken for the proposed new Agency includes a review of all policies & procedures including a revised Code of Business Conduct taking account of the 2009 changes to the Code.  It was intended that formal adoption of the revised Code would be undertaken by the Board of the LGMA on implementation of the merger in the first quarter of 2010.  As the enactment of the legislation is subject to delay, it is intended that the Board of the LGCSB and the LGMSB will adopt the revised Code separately at the next meeting of both Boards scheduled for later in June.  Members of the executive of both Boards have received training to ensure implementation of the Code and it is intended that additional training will be provided for all Board members.  Continued auditing of compliance is being implemented as heretofore.

The majority of the staff employed at the Visitor Centre are local to the area.The visitor season at Skellig Michael runs from the end of May to September, weather permitting, and the island attracts an average of 11,000 visitors each year.  These visitors are conveyed to the island by fourteen local boat operators from Knightstown, Portmagee, Ballinskelligs and Caherdaniel.  There are five guides employed on the island by the Office of Public Works during the visitor season.Ireland has an international obligation to protect, conserve and present its World Heritage properties.  This implies a strong conservation commitment around the properties and greater international and national attention to what happens there.The new Tentative List of potential nominees to the World Heritage List was announced in April 2010 and comprises those properties considered of outstanding universal value, to meet the UNESCO World Heritage inscription criteria in terms of integrity and authenticity and which have the best potential for future inscription on the World Heritage List.  The properties on the list are:the Burren;the Céide Fields & North West Mayo Boglands;the Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape;the Historic City of Dublin;the Early Medieval Monastic Sites (Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells & Monasterboice);the Royal Sites of Ireland (Cashel, Dún Ailinne, Hill of Uisneach,  Rathcroghan Complex &Tara Complex); andthe Western Stone Forts.World Heritage inscription brings increased international awareness of the outstanding universal value of the inscribed property and a potential increase in tourist activity around the property and the area.The proposed nomination of any property on the new Tentative List to the World Heritage List will require the preparation of comprehensive nomination documentation including a management plan for the property.  Consultation will take place with the relevant stakeholders including local communities in the preparation of the documentation for future nominations.

This may be done at the time of the preparation of the development plan or, where appropriate, at any other time.  The making of an addition to, or deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities.The Act also enables the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion of specific structures in its Record of Protected Structures, and a planning authority must have regard to any such recommendations.  These recommendations are based on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) surveys conducted by my Department.  The aim of NIAH surveys is generally to include structures which are of international, national and regional importance.The NIAH survey of the remainder of the Dublin region (Dublin City and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown) is a significant undertaking.  Preparatory work, including discussions with all the relevant authorities, is currently taking place with the objective of starting the survey(s) in 2011.The details of NIAH surveys for Fingal and South County Dublin have already been published and may be consulted on the NIAH website www.buildingsofireland.ie

The mechanism by which these legislative changes can be introduced is under consideration by my Department in consultation with the Department of Transport and the Office of the Attorney General.Part I of the First Schedule of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2009 currently sets out the purposes for which objectives may be indicated in a development plan, including the regulation, restriction or controlling of development in order to reduce the risk of serious danger to human health or the environment.  The interpretation of planning legislation is a matter for the Courts.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	434	The Government, in 2008, considered the position in relation to the former Irish Steel/Ispat site at Haulbowline, noting the outcome of the site investigations, the requirement for various works and further monitoring recommended by the environmental consultants, and the development issues, particularly technical constraints, site boundary issues, zoning issues and regulatory requirements, meriting early attention.The Government decided that the Office of Public Works would chair a working group to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the site with Cork County Council continuing to discharge site management responsibilities on an agency basis.  The membership and terms of reference of the working group are matters primarily for OPW.Regarding human health, the Government noted the outcomes of the independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions on Haulbowline.  This comprised three distinct modules:1. assessing quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity;2. assessment of any health or environmental risks posed by current site conditions; and3. ambient air monitoring.The consultants had available the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Institute and the Health and Safety Authority.Ambient air monitoring was undertaken in accordance with relevant national and international occupational exposure limit values and found that air quality complied with all relevant standards and guidelines, including in Cobh which was the main population centre monitored, and that there is no occupational risk to human health from airborne substances.  Similarly, the assessment of water, sediment and mussel samples employed the relevant applicable screening criteria and found no identifiable risk to the residents of Cork Harbour.In the case of assessing the health and environmental risks posed by potential contaminants in the waste material on the East Tip itself the screening was undertaken using human health generic assessment criteria which are derived from guidance issued in the UK.  These criteria were considered most appropriate for the site, are conservative for on-site exposures for current land use, and did not suggest a risk to health of people on site undertaking normal activities or to those in the Cork harbour area, including the Naval Base.

The deadlines for each of these schemes were extended to 31 December 2006 where existing conditions were met and further extended to 31 July 2008 where additional conditions were met.  305 cities, towns, villages and other locations in urban or rural areas were awarded Section 23 status.24,483 certificates were issued by my Department in respect of these schemes; 156 of these certificates relate to County Kildare.  This figure does not include multi-storey car parks for which certificates were not issued.  The schemes have now closed and no new designations are being considered.The locations in County Kildare which had a designated status in the past 10 years are Athy, Castledermot, Kilcock, Kilcullen, Kildare, Maynooth, Monasterevin and Rathangan.I refer to Appendices 2 and 3 of the Revenue Commissioners' Guide to Section 23 Relief which is available on its website – www.revenue.ie.  The number and location of areas in Ireland that have benefited from urban renewal or special designation status in the past 10 years are set out in the Revenue Commissioners' Guide.In order to apply for section 23 tax relief, an applicant is required to produce a certificate issued by my Department under the relevant scheme to the Revenue Commissioners.  The record of section 23 tax relief claimed and granted on foot of the 24,483 certificates issued by my Department is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  The enforcement of any planning permissions granted is a matter for individual Planning Authorities, irrespective of any designated status applicable.

The statutory responsibility for any actions required in relation to complaints on licences or permits issued is a function for the regulatory body concerned.  I have no function in relation to these matters.  Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Acts 1996-2010, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in particular circumstances in relation to functions conferred on the EPA or a local authority under the Act.There are adequate powers available to local authorities and the EPA to ensure compliance with the conditions of licences and permits issued regarding the operation of waste facilities.  A significant number of complaints received by the EPA relate to odour problems at licensed waste facilities.  A range of measures is being pursued to address these issues, including significant enforcement efforts, the revision of waste licences to require odour management plans, and the publication of guidelines setting minimum acceptable pre-treatment criteria for municipal solid waste being landfilled.  Furthermore, the Food Waste Regulations, which I made in December 2009 and which come into effect in July, will reduce significantly the level of biodegradable waste being landfilled. On foot of these measures, I do not consider that further legislation is needed in this area.Where non-compliance is detected, an escalating series of enforcement actions, from ongoing communication to warning letters, legal notices and, ultimately, Court proceedings are utilised.  EPA resources are managed and directed on an ongoing basis to focus the enforcement effort to where the risks or potential risks are highest and a combination of enforcement tools is used to bring about changes in environmental performance, including the use of site agents, communication with residents' groups and other stakeholders, and assessment of the landfill gas management systems employed.

Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.That mapping exercise found a number of existing broadband suppliers were already active in the area referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ieIt continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently considering the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.

I am informed by ComReg that no organisation has yet applied for the missing children hotline number 116000.  More generally, I would expect that cases of missing children would be reported to the Garda Síochána in the normal way.

The Code was updated in May 2009 and all State bodies under the remit of my Department were provided with the updated Code and advised of their obligations to comply with same.  My Department has developed a comprehensive checklist to assist it in its monitoring role.  In addition there is a specific requirement on the Chair of each State Body to specifically certify that the Body has complied with the Code.

The service provider retains the primary responsibility for complaint resolution where a user experiences difficulties with the service being provided to them.  If a customer is not satisfied with the service provider's complaints handling procedures, he or she may contact the Commission for Communication Regulation (ComReg).  The Communications (Regulation) Act, 2002, as amended outlines ComReg's role in protecting and promoting consumer interests.  Under this Act, ComReg is mandated to ensure a high level of protection for consumers in its dealings with suppliers and to investigate complaints from consumers regarding the supply of and access to, electronic communications services, networks and associated facilities.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	443	Electricity losses are an operational matter for the ESB and EirGrid.  The Department advises that ESB estimate that losses in the Transmission and Distribution of electricity will be approximately 8.5% of recorded customer usage in 2010.  ESB believe that theft and other commercial losses amount to a further 0.5% so that the difference between generated electricity and recorded customer usage will be 9.0% in 2010.  The cost of losses to electricity customers is in the region of €150m per annum.  ESB has reduced losses in the distribution system in the last 5 years by 0.5% of recorded customer usage.  This is mainly as a result of the programme to upgrade rural distribution lines form ten thousand volts (10kV) to 20 thousand volts (20kV).  This programme also improves the quality of voltage provided to customers in rural areas.  EirGrid also works to minimise losses through the way it operates the transmission system.  EirGrid also estimate that the adoption of higher voltages and specialised technologies will result in a reduction of losses on the transmission system.Losses in the transmission and distribution of electricity are a facet of all power systems worldwide and the figure in Ireland is in line with international experience.  Significant reductions require changes to the distribution system which entail substantial capital cost.  Both EirGrid and ESB Networks aim to achieve a balance between capital costs and the level of losses when reinforcing or extending its system.  EirGrid and ESB's policies and practices in relation to losses are supervised by the Commission for Electricity Regulation.

The value of funds to be committed is predicated on the actual price of carbon when the funds are committed.  A carbon price of €15 per tonne would value the fund at €4.5 billion.  The definition of eligible technology sub-categories was finalised by the Climate Change Committee of DG Environment with the involvement of Member States, including Ireland at a meeting in February 2010.  The NER300 proposal has not yet been fully signed off on and is currently still at scrutiny stage with the European parliament.While the technology subcategories were being finalised, potential developers in two technology areas, one in the pumped storage technology area and another in the concentrated solar panel technology area brought the relative merits of their respective technologies to the attention of the Department.  The Department did not propose any amendments to the subcategories under discussion at the Management Committee meeting following these representations.  The meeting in question was attended by an official of the Department who is serving as Energy Attaché in the Permanent Representation in Brussels.  The official consulted with the Department in advance of the meeting.  I am satisfied that the technologies provided for under the programme can accommodate innovative renewable energy technologies subject to suitable projects emerging for assessment as set out below.There will be a single, Europe-wide call for proposals by the Commission.  The Commission is currently working on the terms and conditions for this call for proposals and they have signalled to Member States that they hope to issue the call in quarter three 2010.  Proposals will be sent to the individual Member States for national evaluation and short listing, before any short-listed projects are assessed by the European Investment Bank using its existing standard evaluation methods.  In order to carry out the short listing, Member States will be issued with an assessment methodology by the Commission.  This methodology has not yet been issued.  The assessment will be made by a committee of officials from my Department and Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Subject to eligible proposals emerging, each Member State is guaranteed a minimum of one and a maximum of three demonstration projects across all sub-categories.

I have no function in relation to this matter.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland already have very significant information available on the wind resource in Ireland and have published on their website a national Wind Atlas which shows the onshore and offshore wind resource in great detail on a county by county basis.  The Wind Atlas for Ireland displays wind speed maps for the entire country, and for each county, plus information about the location of the electricity network at both national and county levels.  The Wind Atlas displays wind speeds at 50, 75 and 100 metres above ground level, tiled over Ordinance Survey Ireland (OSI) maps.  Wind speeds can be accurately measured at any location in the country, but the three levels referred to in the previous paragraph represent the hub-heights of current and future wind turbine technology.  Offshore, wind speeds have been mapped to a distance of 25 kilometres from the Irish coast and these are available at www.seai.ie.  The wind resource displayed here has been constrained to exclude areas where wind energy projects will not be permitted such as areas where seabed cables and gas pipelines are located, indicative navigation channels, marine traffic separation / exclusion zones, Department of Defence Danger Areas and near-shore anchorages.

The Board of the Irish National Stud is responsible for the operations and management of the Company.The Government has put in place a system of corporate governance to ensure that State Agencies are directed and managed in such a way so that they serve the interests of the State.  A Code of Practice or the Governance of State Bodies issued in 2001 and an updated version of the Code issued in 2009.  The revised Code is evidence of the Government's recognition of the need to adapt to a changing environment setting out, as it does, an enhanced system of corporate governance for State Agencies for the future.I was most concerned when I learned of press reports in September 2009 of certain financial matters affecting the Irish National Stud Company Ltd., which had the potential to damage the reputation of the Company.  I immediately sought and received a full report from the INS Chairman on the matters raised. The Chairman confirmed to me that she was satisfied that the expenses to which the Deputy refers were approved and adjudged to be necessary for the conduct of the business of the company; international travel is an integral part of the CEO's functions; no first-class travel was incurred by the former CEO; and the Board has since revised its travel policy with a view to achieving greater efficiencies.  In these circumstances these were operational matters within the remit of the Board.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 344 together.As of 4th June 2010, a total of 1,116 people have started on a placement since the launch of the Work Placement Programme last year.  In addition to these placements, there are currently a further 1,719 active Work Placement Programme opportunities being advertised on the FÁS Job Bank.The duration of placements under the Work Placement has been reduced to a minimum of two months and extended to a maximum of nine months; so short work experience placements can be currently accommodated within the programme.  FÁS has in place an application and approval process for determining whether an employer meets the criteria and is therefore suitable to be approved as a provider of placements under the programme.Once they meet the eligibility criteria, clients in receipt of certain welfare payments may retain their welfare entitlements while on a placement, subject to the normal social welfare rules applying.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The Deputy will be aware that the current difficult economic circumstances have necessitated tough choices to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In these circumstances, from September 2010, as announced in the Budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants.  The cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met for eligible students by the Exchequer on their behalf.Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the relevant grant schemes.  Students progressing to a new course with effect from 2010/11 will no longer be eligible for student maintenance grants but can apply for assistance towards the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable.It was decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both the BTEA or VTOS allowance and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments.This measure was recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.Although BTEA students progressing to a new course or new applicants who are in receipt of the BTEA will no longer be able to hold the maintenance portion of the student grand in addition to the BTEA, they may still submit a student grant application to establish entitlement to payment of the student service charge or tuition fees from my Department.Some €5m will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need through the Student Assistance Fund.  The access offices themselves will also continue to provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.  The objective of the fund is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.  Information on the fund is available from the access officer at a candidate's college.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	469	The Irish application seeking co-financing assistance from the European  Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was approved by the College of  Commissioners on 6th May 2010.  It is anticipated that the European Parliament  will, in turn, formally approve the application on or around the 15 June 2010.  The EGF application must also be approved formally by the European Council of  Ministers.Both before and since the making of the EGF application in August 2009 the  relevant State agencies have been implementing measures in support of those  Waterford Crystal workers and workers in ancillary enterprises.  For example,  guidance has been provided by FAS to over 480 workers and almost 250 workers have availed of training places to date. FAS is also funding a foundation  course in skills study and recognised prior learning in conjunction with the  Waterford Institute of Technology and a further foundation course aimed at older workers in conjunction with Waterford Vocational Education Committee.  The  Vocational Education Committees, Enterprise Ireland and the City and County  Enterprise Boards are also offering a range of educational and enterprise supports to former workers.In relation to the recruitment of a specific coordinator of those services to be funded under the EGF, the Department of Education and Skills tendered publicly for this position earlier this year.  A limited number of tenders were received and upon assessment by an evaluation committee chaired by the Department no tender was deemed suitable.  The Department is exploring alternative avenues of recruitment currently.In the interim FAS is chairing a working group of the relevant State agencies and educational institutions to coordinate measures in anticipation of EGF funding.  Steps are also being taken to establish a Steering Committee to include representatives of the former workers with whom FAS continues to have strong linkages.  It is intended that the Steering Committee will be established and hold its first meeting later this month.  The temporary absence of a specific EGF coordinator has not to date constrained, and will not constrain, the design and delivery of measures in support of redundant workers in this instance.

I have received a copy of this report.This research, including recommendations, needs to be considered first of all  by the NCSE.  While the NCSE has funded this research, the report clearly  states that the views and opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the NCSE.I understand that the report may be one of a number of many strands of evidence to be considered when formulating its position in relation to special schools and special classes.  Ultimately, it is expected that advice received from the NCSE will assist my Department with policy formulation in relation to the role  of special schools and special classes.I look forward to receiving the considered views of the NCSE in relation to this issue.

The school's application is currently under consideration and a decision will issue to the Board of Management in due course.The Board of Management has not made any proposal to my Department to develop the Convent building on the adjacent site.However, in recognition of the population growth in Greystones, my Department recently opened two new primary schools.  The need for any additional accommodation in the area will continue to be monitored by the Department's  Forward Planning Section.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	474	The supply teacher scheme was initially set up at primary level over 15 years ago at a time when schools had difficulty getting substitute teachers.  The supply scheme operates on the basis of an additional full-time teacher being allocated to a school to cover certified sick leave absences in that school and a cluster of neighbouring schools.  If the teacher is not required on a given day to cover sick leave absences they generally assist with other work in their school such as administrative duties.  There are 60 posts allocated to the scheme.A value for money review of the Supply Teacher Scheme was published in July  2006.  The review found that approximately 60% of these teachers' time was used to cover sick leave absences with the balance on various other school duties.  This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences.In relation to the Supply Teacher Scheme, while there are benefits for schools in having these full-time teachers it is considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers "on call" all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.The supply teacher scheme will cease from the start of the 2010/11 school year.  The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies.  It is expected that this measure will save €0.4m in 2010 and €1.1m in a full year.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	475	The level of student intake to the Colleges of Education is determined annually by my Department and it takes account of the supply of, and demand for, primary teachers.  The post graduate primary teacher education course for holders of suitable university degrees is provided in four of the Colleges of Education and was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers.  It was first provided in the 1995/96 academic year and has been repeated almost each year since then.The course has not as yet been incorporated as a permanent feature of primary teacher training.  The decision to provide further courses is generally made on an annual basis depending on the teacher supply situation. Intake to the courses which commenced in 2008 and 2009 was at a record high of 490 students.  200 places were approved for the course which commenced in February 2010.The decision on whether to run the course in 2011 will not be taken until later in the year when my Department will consider the factors affecting supply and demand in the light of available resources.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.4 rating.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.   Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.In the meantime, it is open to the school authority to apply to my Department for grant aid under the Summer Works Scheme or for additional temporary accommodation, if this is required.

A round of consultation was completed in summer 2009, under which an open call for written submissions elicited a significant and valuable response. In addition, a series of discussion forums with academics, students, enterprise as well as bilateral meetings with other stakeholders, including the institutions, have been held. The outcomes of these consultations and other ongoing discussions are feeding into the current deliberations of the Strategy Group who are expected to complete their report before this summer.

The provision of and renewal of all such contracts is a matter for each individual Board of Management.Contracts for such staff employed in Community and Comprehensive Schools and schools operated by the 33 Vocational Education Committees are matters for the relevant Board of Management or VEC.The Deputy will be aware of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector.  In the case of VECs and schools in the Community & Comprehensive sector, positions other than teacher and SNA posts in schools, are comprehended by this decision. Circular 0023/2009, a copy of which can be viewed on my Department's website, outlines the impact of the moratorium on Community and Comprehensive Schools and VECs.The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available, and given that there are over 4,000 first and second level schools, would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Section 23 of the Education Welfare Act 2000 requires all schools to have in place a Code of Behaviour. The Act further requires that such a code be prepared in accordance with the guidelines of the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB). These guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying. Accordingly, all schools must have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of its overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.I have no plans to introduce additional legislation as suggested by the Deputy. I am however, intent on supporting schools in tackling bullying. In this regard, a number measures and supports have been put in place in recent years.Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established.My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.In 2007 my Department published, on its website, policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying. The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies and take account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes. Reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.The National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) was established in 2006 in response to the recommendation in "School Matters", the report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools. The NBSS is currently working with over 70 Post Primary Schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.The National Centre for Technology in Education's Webwise Internet Safety initiative includes an integrated educational programme with the following elements:1. The development of an integrated educational programme in partnership with the SPHE Support Service called — Be Safe Be Webwise, which is delivered in the context of the SPHE module on Personal Safety by the SPHE Second Level Support Service2. Delivery of Internet Safety Seminars for parents in schools in partnership with the National Parents Council Primary.3. Provision of Internet safety continuing professional development training for teachers4. The Watch Your Space awareness campaign, which was launched in February 2007, seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when on-line. The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive on-line service, www.watchyourspace.ie developed by the NCTE.  This site offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web. A key feature is the advice given from teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites.5. The EU Safer Internet Programme campaign WATCH_YOUR_SPACE — STOPCYBERBULLYING was launched in 2009.  This social marketing campaign combined blanket and targeted messages delivered through a wide range of media channels and involving children and young people themselves, to the promotion of effective responses to cyber bullying by young people. In Ireland, the campaign included an on-line source of information and advice for young people, watchyourspace.ie, and the TEENTXT active listening service of the ISPCC.The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is also part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.

My Department has no direct involvement in the deployment of teachers within individual VECs. Teacher allocations to all VECs are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment and, in accordance with these rules, each VEC is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are a matter for the individual VECs.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	486	A primary school can be considered for permanent recognition by the Department if:it was established with a minimum enrolment of 17 Junior infants on 30th September in the year of establishment; it has reached a total enrolment of 51 or more pupils within 3 years of establishment; and the relevant local inspector confirms that the school is viable and is operating in adherence to the ‘Rules for National Schools'At post-primary level my Department must be satisfied that there is a need for such a school having regard to existing provision, if any, for post-primary education in the district.In considering an application for permanent recognition due regard is had to the demonstrated growth, success and continuity of the school. As a guideline, it may be taken that a minimum overall enrolment of 300 pupils would be required in order to provide a comprehensive curriculum.With regard to the criteria for All-Irish permanent recognition, my Department is guided by a Commission on School Accommodation (CSA) Report produced in 2004 on the "Criteria and Procedures for establishing and maintaining provision through the medium of Irish in second level schools".As the Deputy may be aware, a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools is currently being undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation. A Technical Working Group, under the direction of the Chairman of the Commission, was established for this purpose. This group has almost completed its work and it is expected that it will make recommendations to me shortly. Among the many issues being considered by the Technical Working Group is the issue of the minimum number of pupils required for the commencement of new schools.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	487	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the review of special needs assistant (SNA) support currently being carried out by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), has been carrying out a review of SNA allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts, as outlined in my Department's Circular 07/02, are properly met. This was an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left. At the same time, the NCSE is allocating additional posts where the criteria are met. The terms and criteria for the SNA scheme have not changed.The NCSE has advised that, in deciding the level of SNA support to be allocated to the school, the SENO visited each school and examined the professional reports for each child with special educational needs.  Every school was requested by the NCSE to inform parents that the review was commencing and to invite them to contribute, should they wish, either by phone contact or by appointment during the review.  The NCSE has further advised that many parents participated in the process.The review process also allowed SENOs the opportunity to discuss with the Principal, teachers and SNA the manner in which the care needs of the child arose in the school and also to look at the school records e.g. incidence reports.  Finally the SENO observed the student in the classroom and schoolyard settings.  In order to fully review the needs of all pupils enrolled in special schools, the NCSE arranged for a team of 2 to 3 SENOs to visit each school.The NCSE has published its report on the Review of SNA Allocation to Schools April 2009 — March 2010 on its website www.ncse.ie. A small number of schools remain to be reviewed and the NCSE has indicated that these will be reviewed by the end of the current academic year.Where a pupil with special educational needs is in receipt of SNA support in a school and moves to another school, the new school applies for SNA support to the SENO.  Such applications are considered by the SENO in the context of the needs of the pupil at the time of transfer to the new school as well as the available resources in the new school.I wish to confirm for the Deputy that my Department is very supportive of the SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes. The SNA scheme will continue to be supported and the NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and resources will continue to be allocated to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

The position in this case is that the pupils referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy are not attending their nearest national school and therefore are not eligible for free school transport.Pupils not attending their nearest national school may avail of fare-paying transport to another school, provided:(a) the written agreement of the board of management of the nearest school is secured;(b) there are spare seats available on the bus; and(c) no extra cost is incurred by extending or re-routing an existing service.The families referred to by the Deputy should liaise with their local Bus Éireann office regarding the availability of spare seats on any existing bus service to the school in which the children are enrolled.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	492	Section 34 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 states that where a registered teacher fails to apply for renewal of registration, the Council shall, upon the expiration of his or her registration, inform him or her that he or she shall be removed from the register within one month unless an application is received for renewal of registration within that period along with the fee for late renewal of registration: Where a registered teacher fails to apply for renewal of registration in accordance with the Act, the Council shall remove the teacher from the register. A registered teacher who has been removed from the register in accordance with the Act may apply to the Council for registration.In the 2008/2009 Annual Report of the Teaching Council, (page 12), it is stated that some 1719 teachers were removed from the register between 28/03/2008 and 27/03/2009 for non-renewal of registration. These persons, who would have received three separate letters requesting them to renew their registration, did not do so prior to the final deadline and were removed from the register in accordance with section 34(1) of the Teaching Council Act, 2001. As stated earlier, these persons may apply again to the Council for registration.As the Teaching Council is the body with statutory responsibility for the registration of teachers any query with regard to registration/renewal of registration should be addressed directly to the Council. The contact details for the Council are available on the website www.teachingcouncil.ie.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	493	Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre.  The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.The Transport Liaison Officer of Co. Galway has informed my Department that the pupil referred to in the details supplied is not attending a school in the catchment area in which he resides and therefore the payment of a grant does not arise. As previously advised, the pupil referred to in the details supplied may only apply for catchment boundary transport subject to the terms outlined above.As the Deputy is aware, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, the review of the catchment boundaries formed part of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme.  The report of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme is being finalised.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	494	As the Deputy is aware, the Fuel Duty Rebate Scheme (Provisions of Section 99 (1) Finance Act 1999) allowed for a rebate in respect of the excise duty paid on fuel used by private contractors on delivering school transport services.  This scheme, which was processed by the Revenue Commissioners, ceased on 31st October 2008 in accordance with the EU Energy Tax Directive.  Due to the very difficult fiscal conditions, it is not possible for my Department to approve any increase towards compensating private operators on contract to Bus Éireann for any loss of income arising from the termination of the fuel rebate scheme.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	496	The residency requirement in the State for grant eligibility for the academic year 2010/2011 will be increased from one year to three out of the past five years for the student.  This amendment is in line with provisions already outlined in the Student Support Bill. In fact, the change in the residency requirement to three out of the last five years instead of the year immediately before entering college will in many instances provide greater flexibility for students who may be returning from abroad. The new residency requirement will also ensure that persons applying for grants will have more established links with and integration in the State.The residency requirement must be met by the student him/herself in all cases and is no longer linked to the residency of the parent/legal guardian for certain categories of students. However, a candidate may qualify for a grant, having met the residency requirement during the course of their studies. The residency requirement is also extended to 3 out of 5 years in respect of those in receipt of the "fees only grant".
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-09 00:00:00	Prelude	497	As the Deputy may be aware, the recognition of teacher qualifications is now a matter for the Teaching Council, the body with responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards in the teaching profession.  My officials have made enquiries with the Teaching Council regarding this case and are advised as follows:The Teaching Council has verified from the records of its predecessor, the Registration Council, that the person who is the subject of this question was admitted to the Register of Intermediate School Teachers.  The person was registered by the Registration Council on November 26, 1992.  To date, The Teaching Council has no evidence that the person's qualifications were recognised by the Registration Council or the Department of Education and Skills for the purpose of teaching Mathematics.The details of the person concerned were transferred onto the register in March 2006. However, she did not avail of the provisions of registration under section 31(2) and (3), (a person who was already a teacher) of the Teaching Council Act, 2001.  She applied for registration on November 26, 2008 and was registered under section 31(5) on December 15, 2008.  Her B.Sc. degree was deemed to have met the requirements for the curricular subjects of Chemistry and Biology.In late May 2010, the applicant queried why Mathematics was not presented on her confirmation of registration.  She was invited to present the transcripts of her qualifications. On May 26th 2010, the applicant submitted transcripts and at this stage it was confirmed that her qualifications did not meet the criteria for Mathematics.The Council has re-examined her transcripts in recent weeks and maintains its view that the coverage of Mathematics in her undergraduate qualification does not meet the registration criteria for Mathematics. It has recently submitted the transcripts to an external assessor for a further assessment and a response is awaited. The Council will consider the matter further when a response has been received from the external assessor.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

This review was initiated by my predecessor in September 2008. A Technical Working Group, under the direction of the Chairman of the Commission, was established by the Commission to undertake the detailed work on the review and to report back to the Commission.The terms of reference for the Technical Working Group are as follows:Invite submissions from the public and interested partiesConsider the submissions both written and oralConduct a detailed analysis of all the issuesExamine the Reports of the New Schools Advisory Committee (NSAC) and the issues raisedConsider international best practice in this areaReport to the Steering Group of the Commission on their analysis and findingsMake detailed recommendations for revised arrangements for new schools.The Technical Working Group has met on eight occasions, which included an initial joint meeting with the Commission Steering Group. It also had a meeting with the original NSAC members, where the issues raised in the NSAC annual reports were explored in greater detail. These meetings were all convened in the Department's offices in Marlborough Street.  The Technical Working Group is due to report to the Commission in the near future.I would hope that the Commission will be in a position to report to me soon after receipt and consideration of the Technical Working Group's report. I will then consider the policy matters and any necessary arrangements and revised procedures that will need to be put in place in regard to the recognition process for new primary schools.
