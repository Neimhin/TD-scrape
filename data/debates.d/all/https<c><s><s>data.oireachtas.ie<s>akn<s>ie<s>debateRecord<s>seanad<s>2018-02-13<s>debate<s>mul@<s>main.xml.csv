I am looking for an update on the report on the cost of motor insurance. Many people, especially the self-employed, have come to my office to tell me about the significant increase in their insurance premiums. I know the Minister of State set up a committee and a working group was drawn together to deal with it. A report published recently showed that some premiums increased by up to 57% between 2011 and 2016. Last year, by shopping around some people had a small decrease in their premium. Insurance premiums are out of control. This is a major issue and I would like the Minister of State to give me an up-to-date report on what is happening.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	3	I thank Senator Byrne for tabling a Commencement matter as it gives me an opportunity to outline the position. Members of the Seanad will be aware that the report on the cost of motor insurance was published in January 2017. It made 22 recommendations, with 71 associated actions to be carried out. The aim of the implementation of this report is to try to remove the volatility that we have seen with motor premiums in the past number of years, both up and down, and bringing the premiums from the very high levels into line with lower levels.  The report recognises that as there is such a range of factors that influence pricing, including the natural cycle of the market, consequently it is not possible to transform the underlying dynamic overnight. It is worth noting that last month marked the first anniversary of the publication of the report. More than half of the 71 actions had been implemented by the end of 2017. Senators should note that the fourth quarterly update report will be published in the coming days. This will give full details of the implementation of each of the recommendations. The Government approved the general scheme of a Bill to establish a new national claims information database in the Central Bank of Ireland. It has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. This is a key recommendation of the motor insurance report as this database will collect aggregate information linked to claims for private motor business from motor insurers to provide greater transparency on claim trends. I also acknowledge the work of the Personal Injuries Commission, which is chaired by former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns. The commission delivered its first report in December. Its findings suggest that adopting a standardised, internationally recognised approach to diagnosis, treatment and reporting of soft tissue injuries by practitioners who are appropriately competent and trained will improve the personal injuries environment in Ireland. The Government remains committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the cost of insurance working group. In this regard, work is continuing on important issues such as the development of an insurance fraud database in the Department of Justice and Equality and an uninsured drivers database in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The report provides us with a very good opportunity to address a range of problems in the sector. The Senator can be assured that I will work with my ministerial colleagues to ensure that the cost of insurance is reduced. There appears to have been greater stability in the market in recent months. The most recent data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, indicate that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 16.3% from their peak in July 2016. While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability overall, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who are still seeing increases. There is work to be done in this regard. The Senator can be sure that the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the other Departments of Government, along with everybody involved in insurance, are attempting to ensure that the cost is reduced.

#MariaByrne	unknown-#MariaByrne-party	unknown-#MariaByrne-dob	unknown-#MariaByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	5	I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. I will just give him a small example. A person in their early 50s came into my office recently whose premium had previously been a little more than €800. This person had received a bill for close to €1,200 despite having a no claims bonus and having never had a crash in 30 odd years of driving. Some of the companies are definitely still abusing the system. They are the ones which need to be looked at. I look forward to the Minister of State returning with a more substantial report once it has been published. Perhaps he will give a commitment to keeping an eye on this issue because it needs to be acknowledged that some of the companies are definitely abusing the system, although some others are working to decrease premiums.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	I would like to put it on the record of the House that I have also heard of dozens of such cases. One gentleman came to me whose insurance premium had increased from €700 to over €1,000. He pursued the company and went to a different broker. The broker went to a number of companies and eventually got back to the company this gentleman had been with. He managed to get his insurance for the same price as previously because he used a different broker. There are many anomalies in the motor insurance industry and it is difficult to put a figure on them. That is the way the insurance companies operate. It is important for people to recognise a couple of factors. The 57% increase was from a base that was too low. Companies established themselves here and went after market share. There was a price war and price wars never turn out well. The cost of insurance was actually too low. They were not operating from a proper base. Reducing premiums by 16% is a good start, although it is only a start. There are many other recommendations which will eventually be implemented. On the example the Senator gave, we are asking the insurance companies to explain why insurance premiums have increased. They have to put the reason down on paper and give a proper explanation to each individual as to why the underwriters feel the premium should increase. That is another example of one of the more than 70 recommendations upon which the Government is acting.

#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	8	I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for taking this matter, which relates directly to the Department of Finance. In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to develop a public community banking system. There is a well-worn and well-articulated narrative as to what has happened in the banking sector in this country.There are many examples of misbehaviour by the banks in the past. When they got a bailout, they continued to misbehave. Unfortunately, many of them are continuing to misbehave. In Germany, where public and community banking was initiated, up to 70% of banking is done through community and public banks. When I was in Ennis on Saturday, I spoke to a man who is promoting the concept of public banking along with a number of his colleagues. They have seen at first hand what has happened in the banking sector in this country. As this country enters what we hope will be a period of prosperity, I dread and fear that history will repeat itself. The one thing we should do as a society is learn from the mistakes of the past. There is no doubt that mistakes were made within the banking sector and with the regulation of the banking sector. Serious mistakes were made in the past by the Department of Finance, where the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is based, and by the Central Bank, which was governing the operation and regulation of the banking sector. We had light-touch regulation in this country for far too long. It did not work. We need to move forward in a spirit of positivity and in an engaging way to do things differently and to avail of the best of what Ireland has to offer. We have the best ICT skills in the world. We have the best financial services brains and they are indigenous and organic to this country. We can be the best in the world at community and public banking. We have the skill set. The Government should make this a cornerstone of its financial policy as it goes forward. I hope the Minister of State agrees with me.

Under the local public banking model, a state or another public body has ownership of a financial institution. Local public banks in Germany, which are called Sparkassen, are not permitted to operate outside specific geographic regions. Their aim is not to maximise profits but to promote economic development and financial inclusion in the regional areas in which they operate. Additionally, the business model of Sparkassen involves building close relationships with local small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. Officials in the Department of Finance have been working closely with their colleagues in the Department of Community and Rural Development. Their investigation of local public banking has consisted of a consultation process with stakeholders and interested parties, including the credit union movement and An Post. They have analysed a detailed proposal on the Sparkassen model and its possible implementation in Ireland that was put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation, SBFIC, which is the international development wing of the Sparkassen group. Officials in the Department of Finance have had a number of meetings with representatives of Irish Rural Link and the SBFIC. Officials from both Departments have prepared a report on the findings of their investigation. The report is being reviewed and considered by the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Ring. When the two Ministers have approved the report, it will be brought to the Government for consideration and approval. If and when the report is approved by the Government, I anticipate that it will be published immediately. The Senator should be aware that the Government is fully supportive of increased competition in the banking sector. It encourages any potential new market entrants to engage further with the Central Bank of Ireland on this matter. The Senator may wish to note that significant Government measures are already in place to support access to finance by Irish SMEs, including the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the supporting SMEs online tool, the microenterprise loan fund, the local enterprise offices, the Credit Review Office and the credit and counter guarantee schemes. I will give two examples of how Government supports are helping SMEs to access finance and supporting employment.The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland began lending in March 2015, providing funds thorough bank and non-bank on-lending partners. To the end of December 2017, some €925 million of SBCI supported lending has been approved for almost 23,000 Irish SMEs, operating across all sectors of the economy, including agriculture, food, retail, health care, transport and manufacturing. The Credit Review Office, CRO, is a Government initiative that helps SMEs who had an application for credit of up to €3 million declined or reduced by the main banks and feel that they have a viable business proposition. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The CRO has received almost 900 applications, with almost 700 cases concluded to date. It has successfully overturned more than 50% of the decisions made by banks. Over €48 million has been advanced on foot of the CRO’s recommendations and 3,750 jobs have been created or protected as a result. In addition to these supports, the Department of Finance is working with other Departments to develop tailored and innovative schemes to meet the evolving needs of Irish SMEs, such as the €150 million agricultural cashflow support loan scheme and the €300 million Brexit loan scheme announced by then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in budget 2017 and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in budget 2018. Rural and regional development and supporting Irish SMEs to create employment and economic growth are important Government priorities and significant overall policy considerations. The Department of Rural and Community Development will continue to focus on rural Ireland and rural and regional development generally and will provide a co-ordinating role across Government on this priority area. The Senator can be assured that facilitating a functioning and competitive banking and mortgage lending system, in addition to supporting economic growth and employment in rural areas and regional Irish SMEs, remains a crucial priority for the Government.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	11	I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive outline of Government initiatives. I acknowledge that much has been done but there is still a way to go in terms of creating a fair equilibrium in banking because, unfortunately, the community and public banking model has been thwarted in favour of traditional commercial banks. The initiative that has been tried, tested and worked wonderfully in parts of Germany is getting serious consideration and I hope that the Minister of State and his Cabinet colleagues will, with their Departments, make a decision on this report as soon as possible because people would be happy to see progress on this matter. I acknowledge that the rate of progress is slow but I would rather it be slow and done right than rushed and not done right.

Members are aware of the result of having the wrong type of competition 12, 14 or 15 years ago. It completely skewed the pitch. I discussed insurance earlier. The wrong type of competition can have a hugely detrimental impact in many different areas. The model in place did not have the correct balance between equity and lending. Whether small, big or other lending, it is important to have a different model. The model in Europe is 80:20 lending versus equity, while in the United States it is closer to 70% equity to 30% lending. The best model is probably somewhere in between and that is where we would like to be. I am very encouraged by the credit union aspect with An Post and possibly supported by Government funding. We will consider the report when it is concluded and it will be analysed by both Departments and then go to the Government for consideration. There will be no delay on behalf of the Department of Finance in trying to implement a new model and structure and better competition in the market.

#PaulGavan	unknown-#PaulGavan-party	unknown-#PaulGavan-dob	unknown-#PaulGavan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	14	I welcome the Minister of State. I raise the issue of Newport day care centre in County Tipperary. The centre was established in 1992 and now caters for hundreds of elderly folk from the parishes of Newport, Toor, Birdhill, Ballinahinch, Killoscully, Ballina, my own village of Castleconnell, Kilcommon and Rearcross each week in a manner that has changed the quality of life for many of them for the better. A small team of ten health care professionals provide a wide range of community, health, well-being and respite services. Without this facility, hundreds of service users would have to attend at the already vastly overcrowded University Hospital Limerick for their health care needs. The staff have an extremely heavy workload and, like so many others in the sector, regularly go above and beyond their job specifications to ensure the highest standards of care and support for their clients. Above all, there is a great sense of community that runs through the heart of everything that is done at the centre. The range of community and health services provided make a crucial difference to the lives of so many people in the Tipperary and Limerick region. The staff who provide this excellent range of services had their pay cut without negotiation in 2008. A decade on, their pay remains exactly where it was after that cut. They see their colleagues and other HSE-funded organisations that have benefited from pay restoration or other section 39 organisations that now, thankfully, have a means of redress through a structured and transparent pay restoration mechanism agreed between my union, SIPTU, and the Department of Health and the HSE. Where is the roadmap for the workers at the Newport day care centre to achieve their pay restoration? Where is their means of achieving any kind of pay rise after a decade enduring a significant pay cut which was imposed without agreement? That pay cut was imposed as a result of a direct instruction from the HSE to the manager of Newport day care centre. We know this facility is suffering from significant underfunding. We know it because the management of Newport day care centre has - in writing - cited underfunding as the reason they will not attend the Workplace Relations Commission; they have no financial means of addressing the claims of the SIPTU members working at the centre. As management will not attend the Workplace Relations Commission, the workers concerned have no choice but to ballot for industrial action. This is a publicly-funded facility. Surely the workers must have some means of redress, surely they deserve some hope after years of loyal service and surely there is a responsibility on the Minister of State to make this possible. I am asking her to include these workers in the mechanism for pay restoration for section 39 workers. Otherwise they will be left with no choice but to initiate industrial action. Nobody wants a strike to take place, least of all the workers themselves. It will take place, however, unless the Minister of State provides a means for these workers to press their legitimate claim for pay restoration.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	15	I am responding on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath. I thank Senator Gavan for raising this issue. The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live with dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible and to support access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate The HSE has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering health and personal social services including home help, home care packages, meals on wheels, respite or day care and a range of other community based supports. Services are delivered through the HSE and its funded agencies to people in local communities, as close as possible to people’s homes. Our ageing population is one of the most significant demographic and societal developments that Ireland has encountered in modern times. Not only are people living longer, but a great many people are staying healthier and living better for a longer time. Demand for community services is rising as more people are supported in their own homes rather than in hospitals or nursing homes. Access to day care centres such as Newport can make an important contribution by providing invaluable support, advice and social interaction for older people who may for any number of reasons be experiencing isolation and loneliness. The Senator asks about funding of the Newport day care centre. In 2017, the centre received funding of €228,000 from the HSE. This included national lottery funding of €1,500.The HSE funds this organisation through a grant under section 39 of the Health Act 2004. Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to services the HSE may provide.  The Senator also referred to an impending ballot for industrial action in this organisation. I understand this is a ballot on the restoration of pay to staff. The Senator will be aware that last Friday, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, welcomed a deferral of industrial action by section 39 workers. He has also confirmed that the Department of Health, the HSE and trade unions have agreed that the HSE would carry out an analysis to establish whether supporting evidence shows whether, when and to what extent reductions in pay rates were applied during the crisis in each relevant organisation; whether, when and to what extent restoration of pay reductions have happened; and to identify financial implications for such organisations, taking account of all of the resources of funding associated with addressing the issue and identifying and proposing an appropriate plan of phased resolution in each case. The HSE will continue the data gathering exercise immediately, initially in respect of an agreed list of organisations. The data gathering exercise should be completed as early as possible. An interim report is expected to be published by the end of March 2018.  Dispute resolution in Ireland is based on the concept of parties voluntarily seeking to resolve their differences with industrial relations mechanisms provided by the State. This would include availing of services provided by the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. The process I have set out should resolve the situation in respect of the pay issue in section 39 funded organisations at a national level. The Workplace Relations Commission plays a pivotal role in brokering agreement between the parties on such matters. On that basis, I cannot speak highly enough of these bodies and the support they provide to workers and employees. At a local level, I hope that staff and management in the Newport Day Care Centre in Tipperary continue to work towards progressing issues on a consensus basis using the recognised industrial relations channels which they have open to them.

I note she stated that she hoped staff and management in Newport Day Care Centre in Tipperary would continue to work towards progressing issues on a consensus basis using the recognised industrial relations channels that are open to them. Unfortunately, a channel is not open to them given that the management has said it cannot attend the WRC because there is no funding from the Government. It would be very helpful, given that the staff are being balloted this week and service users and staff are listening to this debate today, if the Minister of State could confirm that the staff at Newport Day Care Centre will be included in the section 39 pay restoration mechanisms she has outlined. A simple "Yes" would put the staff's minds at ease and guarantee they have a process open to them. If she cannot say "Yes" then, unfortunately, industrial action will be pursued. I am hoping she will give a positive answer in response to the workers in Newport Day Care Centre and the clients who value the service.

I again thank the Senator for raising the matter. He will appreciate that the Newport Day Care Centre is funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 and neither the Minister nor the HSE has a direct role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to the staff. This means that I cannot get involved in local disputes arising in these bodies. However, as I noted earlier, the services of the Workplace Relations Commission provide valuable resources and are available to bodies and individuals who find themselves involved in disputes in the workplace. I would urge all parties to take full advantage of this service where possible in order that a positive and workable solution can be found for all involved. I am clear in my view that any disputes which are ongoing in health care services should be minimised and addressed as early as possible. We must avoid any impact on the more vulnerable members of society, such as those availing of services at the Newport Day Care Centre.The Senator has asked me to give him a "Yes" or "No" answer. I cannot do that. I have read the reply, but I will speak to the Minister later about what he said about the staff feeling that they do not have a channel to go through. Perhaps the Minister will come back to the Senator with a formal answer.

Ms Hazel Robinson is the parent of a 15 year old daughter with cystic fibrosis. She started this vigil because her daughter was recently obliged to wait over a week to secure a bed in the hospital after she contracted influenza, which compromised her health further. Ms Robinson has faced the same problem on numerous occasions when trying to source a bed for treatment for her very sick daughter. Many of the parents there last night share that experience. What are we doing wrong? Are we doing anything right? I have been working on a document, now ready for publication, which specifically focuses on Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital, Crumlin, and what investment is needed and where it needs to go. The stark figures and data, from parliamentary questions and from the Department itself, show that the inpatient waiting times for the hospital are unacceptably high. The total inpatient day case waiting number for the entire children's hospital, which includes the other two hospitals, is at almost 5,000. Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital, Crumlin, accounts for over half of these. The position is unacceptable, especially considering that many of the children are waiting with life-threatening and progressively deteriorating conditions. The waiting list for children with musculoskeletal problems to access the orthopaedic unit is often 18 months. That issue has been highlighted several times by the national public broadcaster.  I want to know what plans are in place to tackle the trolley crisis in our children's hospital system. We know all about it in the adult accident and emergency departments, but the children and their parents deserve as much attention and dedication to solving the problem. Is it the case that we are going to have to wait until the establishment of the national children's hospital in 2020 or 2021? There is a significant timeframe involved here for sick children. They do not have that time available. I hope that the national children's hospital will be fit for purpose and have sufficient capacity, but what can we do in the meantime?
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	22	The Minister, who unfortunately cannot be here, has asked me to answer on his behalf. I acknowledge that there are some challenges in accessing services in the three children’s hospitals at present. The Children’s hospital group works with the each of the three paediatric hospitals to manage capacity challenges, providing support in terms of bed utilisation on a daily basis. Within Our Lady's Children’s Hospital, Crumlin, all funded beds are open and currently in use, with the exception of one bed closed for renovation purposes. The hospital group is working with the National Treatment Purchase Fund to identify clinically appropriate groups of patients for treatment as part of a waiting list initiative. The hospital group also continues to work with the acute hospital division in the HSE as well as with staff in the mental health primary care and disability services to reduce the length of stay of patients in hospital and to improve pathways of care for children and adolescents, which will, in turn, ease pressures on hospital capacity. The Minister is committed to significantly improving health care for all children in Ireland. We have already taken enormous strides to achieve this.For example, an additional €9 million has been provided to the HSE in its 2018 budget allocation, specifically to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including further increasing access to scoliosis services. As Members will know, the project to develop the new children’s hospital is an extraordinary opportunity to enhance paediatric services for children. Indeed, part of the rationale for the development of the new children’s hospital was to address the existing physical infrastructure across the three children’s hospitals in the group. There is limited ability to increase bed capacity in the existing hospitals between now and the opening of the new hospital. The design of the new children’s hospital and two outpatient and urgent care centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital was based on a thorough analysis of capacity and demand, and is in line with best practice. The new children’s hospital is due to be completed in 2022. This will be preceded by the opening of the centres in Connolly and Tallaght hospitals in 2019 and 2020 to provide consultant-led urgent care and secondary outpatient services, including rapid access general paediatric clinics. Each centre is projected to deal with 25,000 urgent care and 15,000 outpatient attendances annually, resulting in a significant improvement in access to services. Overall, the new facilities are expected to provide an increase in capacity of 16% for inpatients, 26% for day cases, 47% for outpatient attendances and 7% for emergency department, ED, attendances. My Department is also progressing the Children’s Health Bill 2018 to establish a single body to govern and manage paediatric services across the three hospitals in Dublin in advance of the move to the new facilities. A clinical integration strategy has been developed to integrate the clinical services across the hospital in advance of the move and to ensure a smooth transition to the new facilities. There will be significant advantages to having integrated clinical and non-clinical services across the existing sites, one of which is the introduction of a central referrals system for all patients requiring paediatric services to maximise available capacity. The transition of staff and services to the new children’s hospital will ultimately mean that all specialist services will be provided under one roof, tri-located with adult acute facilities. I thank the Senator. I will respond further on some of the other issues she raised.

I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, but I thought that the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, would have a response as well. I note that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has announced that it will include the national children's hospital in its daily Trolley Watch and started doing so at the beginning of the year. For the first two weeks at the beginning of the year the INMO counted 23 children on trolleys. This must be a focus for the Government again. Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin went over budget by €500,000 last year. It has clearly not been getting the resources that it requires, and a lot of that money is spent on agency staff because of the moratorium and its effects. Some 2,818 more children attended the accident and emergency department in 2017, but the capacity levels in the hospital have only now returned to 2012 figures. There is a significant increase in our child population, and in the last decade many more births were recorded in Ireland. We are not matching capacity to the birth rate and the increase in population. We are doing an absolute disservice to our children.

I absolutely agree with her that it is unacceptable that adults or children should have to wait any length of time to be facilitated in a hospital. I have outlined in the response from the Minister that a lot of money has gone into this service, and a lot of things are happening in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. That must be said in all fairness to the staff and doctors there, who deal on a daily basis with children from right across the country with very serious illnesses. The Government is committed to doing all it can to support and ensure that the needs of children who are ill can be addressed as quickly as possible. Unfortunately in the three children's hospitals available to us at present, the facilities do not have the capacity at this time to avail of it. There are no options left in children's hospitals, to my knowledge and to that of the Minister, whereby more beds can be made available.  In saying that, I do think it is unacceptable that any child should be left to wait for any amount of time. Going over its budget does not really reflect on Our Lady's Children's Hospital, because a lot of hospitals go over budget for many different reasons.There are many reasons a hospital might go over budget and it is not something that only applies to Crumlin. Since the beginning of October, we have had a long winter and a lot of children have been sick with respiratory complaints. I have taken note of what the Senator said and I will forward her points to the Minister. As the children's hospital is in my own constituency, I will make it my business to correspond with it on the management of beds, particularly in respect of the services that are available at present. As the Senator said, parents have deemed this to be of such interest to them that they feel they have to hold a candlelight vigil.

I wish to draw attention to the daft.ie report, which was published this morning and which shows an increase in rents throughout the city. Rents in Dublin alone have gone up by an average of €380 a month. Let us be clear, wages are not going up as fast as rents and people in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP, are struggling to keep up with rising rents. The idea of matching HAP payments with these increases provides no solution. I have discussed this issue at length in this House. We know that the real issue is the lack of supply. I call once again for a State-wide social housing construction programme like the one in the years after the foundation of this State. I am familiar with an estate in my own local area, called the Tenters. This estate was one of the first social housing programmes built by the first Irish Government. These houses are almost 100 years old and are considered some of the finest homes in the city. We need to look back at what we were able to do in the past with little or no capital budgets. We now have 9,000 people living in emergency accommodation and there are 85,000 people on social housing lists yet we do not seem to have any solution. There seems to be no urgency on this huge issue. House prices are increasing weekly and there is a lack of supply. Young couples cannot afford to save at the same rate that the house prices are increasing. I do not trust Rebuilding Ireland. We need to see local authorities or some State arm taking control and building the houses we urgently need.  I also wish to raise the matter of Versatis pain relieving patches. Like many Senators, I have received many calls to my office by people who have been denied affordable access to these patches on either the drugs payment scheme or the medical card. These people are vulnerable and often bedridden with excruciating pain. They do not have the strength or energy to attend and protest outside Leinster House like other groups. Fortunately, through "Liveline", RTÉ has given these vulnerable people a platform to air their grievance. They have been unfairly targeted in an effort by the HSE to shave money off the drugs budget. It is one of the cruellest acts of this Government and shows its contempt and disregard for those on the margins who do not have a strong voice. I call on the Minister to attend the House to explain the rationale for culling the budget for Versatis patches and call on him to direct his staff to reinstate the patches on the drug refund and medical card schemes without delay.

I call on the appropriate Minister to come to the House to explain the Government's intentions in establishing an electoral commission. Page 152 of the programme for partnership Government states the Government's commitment to establishing an independent electoral commission and sets out its role and functions. It is important that we have a strong, robust and independent electoral commission. It makes sense. We need to increase voter participation and promote engagement in the process. We need to put in place a formal structure for the registration of political parties, regulate political funding and electoral expenditure and oversee the forthcoming referendum commission. There is always controversy when there is a referendum. There are also controversies over the up to date register of electors. There are local authorities which are not actively and meaningfully going out and doing fieldwork, and door-to-door calls to get people on the register. Some people find they have been taken off the register without any request having been made on the matter. There are various issues around this. The key values in this matter are impartiality, accountability, transparency, and integrity and, above all, we should encourage people to engage in the participative democratic process. Will the Leader arrange for the appropriate Minister, I think it is the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, to come to the House and give us an overview of his plans in this area? My colleague, Senator Catherine Ardagh spoke about Rebuilding Ireland. I know people are frustrated by it but it is important that we give it a chance. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government. Things are being achieved but progress is slow. The Senator referred to the rental sector earlier and was right to do so, and it was also mentioned today, but it is important to give Rebuilding Ireland a chance. If it does not perform in another few months, then let us start asking the hard questions, but a lot is happening. The Minister and his colleagues were out in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown where there was a very detailed presentation at the council meeting, with a question and answer session. I think we are seeing progress and it is important to give it a chance.  Tomorrow we will have before us the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill. I urge as many Members as possible to be here tomorrow. I have tabled one amendment which I will not get into now, but it relates to participative democracy and our county councillors. At present, certain organisations, prescribed bodies such as An Taisce and many others, can write objections without paying a fee. That is the reality of it. Many other prescribed bodies can do likewise and I do not oppose that, but I have a great difficulty with democratically elected local councillors having to put their hand in their pockets to submit an observation, not to mention an objection or even a letter of support. Tomorrow, we have an opportunity in primary legislation to change that position. I will make a strong case for that then and I would appreciate the Leader's support.

The Leader will be familiar with the case of Emma De Souza whose battle to assert her Irish citizenship rights has gained wide coverage on various media platforms, North and South, not least in The Irish Times, because I have raised it previously. Emma De Souza is an Irish citizen from Magherafelt. She currently lives in Belfast with her husband, Jake. The reason this has become such an issue for them and they have faced such an arduous battle to uphold and protect the most basic of democratic rights is when Emma applied for a permanent residency visa for her husband, the British Home Office told her that in order for her to assert her Irish citizenship, she had to renounce British citizenship because it was presumed that since she was born in the North, she is automatically a British citizen. Emma contests this and says that, under the Good Friday Agreement, her rights as an Irish citizen solely are clear. At three various tribunal hearings in Belfast's High Court, that position was supported and endorsed by judges. The British Home Office is appealing the decision for a third time. I do not know whether Home Office officials who deal with such visa applications are ignorant of the contents, principles and legislation flowing from the Good Friday Agreement or whether something more sinister is at play. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should meet Emma to hear her story and they should act as champions not just on her behalf in this case, but on behalf of all those who find themselves in a similar position. The agreement is clear. We are not partial or conditional citizens and we certainly should not be second-class citizens. It would send a positive message in concert and in tune with recent statements from An Taoiseach and his Government colleagues that they will not abandon Irish citizens in the North. That is the right and proper stand to take. Will the Leader relay that message to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and ask that they respond to my request to meet Emma as soon as possible? I refer to the launch of the new Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade dedicated website on Brexit. That is a welcome resource, which I am sure will be utilised extensively given the uncertainty relating to Brexit in the context of the agreement, citizenship rights, the Border, economic and other implications. Given the extensive nature of Brexit's negative implications, I call on the Government to consider a dedicated facility in the North of Ireland that would be rights-based in its service delivery and act as a support for citizens who will be trapped or held hostage in a post-Brexit scenario against their will. To be fair to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, he stated at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement that he would examine this issue. The trial of Ahed Tamimi began in an Israeli military court earlier. I have raised her case on a number of occasions. The media has been expelled from the trial and it is being held behind closed doors. A 17 year old child is being tried in a military court for slapping the face of an Israeli soldier who is illegally occupying the town in which she lives. I reiterate my party's support, and, hopefully, the Seanad's support, for Ahed and her family.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	30	I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to take No. 18 on the Supplementary Order Paper before No. 1. Bogus self-employment is a major issue. It is prevalent in the construction and agriculture sectors and it is becoming more prevalent in the ICT, financial services, legal, media and transport sectors.Anybody who is familiar with this phenomenon will know it denies workers of their entitlements and the protections that every other worker in this country should expect to have. It is an insidious practice. It also deprives the State of up to €60 million in lost tax and PRSI revenue, a figure that I draw from a recent report published by the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, when the previous Government asked the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to undertake an investigation and examination of the losses to the State in terms of the practice of what the Department now calls disguised self-employment. I think people will be more familiar with another phrase, which is "bogus self-employment". This is false self-employment, that is, the misclassification by employers of the employment status of people who are, to all intents and purposes, their direct employees in order to enable the employers, in many respects, to avoid their tax and PRSI obligations to the State. It is an insidious practice that encourages a race to the bottom in terms of employment practices in this country, and it needs to be stamped out. We need a legislative response, not simply the maintenance of a code of practice that was introduced in 2007 and is no longer fit for purpose. We need that code of practice encapsulated in our statute law. This Bill intends to do that and it also intends to ensure that those who are depriving the State of the tax and PRSI revenue owed to the State through the misclassification of somebody's categorisation should be treated for what they are - tax cheats.

We are all aware that over the last year in particular, but at all times since I became a Member of this House, there have been attempts to improve the pay and conditions of local authority members of county and city councils, who are to the forefront of our democracy. Some of these changes have come about in the past 12 months in regard to PRSI payable by councillors and it is now equal to that paid by the self-employed. However, this is of little or no benefit to the majority of councillors. The additional €1,000 provided to recognise the additional workload which has arisen as a result of the creation of municipal districts has not been added to the expenses of councillors, even though these are expenses, but has been added to the representational allowance, which is subject to income tax and PRSI. The option for councillors of €5,000 of vouched expenses is so restrictive that fewer than 3% have opted for this. Another measure introduced last year changed the payment rates for mileage and introduced a banding system on a par with the rest of the public sector. These bands and rates were agreed by the public sector unions and representatives of the Government without any input from those who represent local authority members. As a trade unionist, the Leader knows it is a fundamental of any negotiations on public sector pay and conditions that the people affected are represented at such negotiations. This courtesy was not afforded to local authority members through either the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, or the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA. These bands have led to the introduction of a requirement for aggregation of travel claims by members of local authorities across the various bodies on which they represent the public - not themselves but the public. The Oireachtas has placed an obligation on local authorities to nominate members to serve on the education and training boards, the regional assemblies, the governing authorities of various third level institutions and many other bodies. We are now requiring councillors and their parent local authorities to administer an extraordinarily convoluted system for the payment of a pittance to local authority members to cover their travel expenses. Officials in Departments and local authorities will have no difficulty with the systems because their pay and expenses are administered by their employers. However, the nature of membership of a local authority is that significant travel is involved and is payable from multiple authorities for the various activities in which we require our county councillors and city councillors to engage. Furthermore, the rates specified in the Department circular are Revenue-approved rates. This calls into question whether county councillors now have an obligation to aggregate the travel and subsistence payable to them in their work as members of a local authority and the various public bodies on which they serve with any travel and subsistence they may receive in their private employment in order to remain tax compliant. As a result of these changes, some members have become disadvantaged financially. This new system of travelling expenses has caused huge difficulties for rural councillors in particular. There are councillors in rural Ireland who represent very rural constituencies and, in some instances, island communities who are losing up to €4,500 or €5,000 for doing their job. This is not acceptable. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister of State with responsibility for local government, in particular local government reform and the pay and conditions of our local authority members, come before the House. Finally, special recognition needs to be given to the unique status of the role of the local elected member within the local government system. The possibility of a dedicated travel rates system applicable to local authority members only, in recognition of their unique role within local government, needs to be looked at. No elected member can be allowed to be worse off due to these new regulations anymore. I am putting the House on notice, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, that we will not tolerate this. This is why I propose an amendment to the Order of the Business.

I refer to the law on female genital mutilation. This is the first time the Seanad has met since the broadcast last Thursday night of an interview on "Prime Time" in which Dr. Ali Selim made the outrageous statement that female circumcision, also known as female genital mutilation, bore comparisons to male circumcision, which it does not in any way. To be absolutely clear, male circumcision is a medical procedure; female circumcision is genital mutilation. "Female circumcision" is not a medical term; it is a cultural term and a cultural procedure. I am appalled, as an Irishman, a father, a brother and a husband, that such statements would be made.I am particularly appalled and affronted by the fact that someone who uses the title of "Dr." made such a statement on national television. In a week where we celebrated the 100 year anniversary of women in this country getting the vote and there is a worldwide campaign to raise awareness about female genital mutilation with over 2 million tweets sent out, it is appalling that such misinformation would be put about. I would like to see the said gentleman withdraw his comments and acknowledge that he is wrong. I know that he is not a medical doctor. Nonetheless, he did a disservice to and insulted the women of this country and around the world by saying what he said and I believe that he should withdraw his comment.  The World Health Organization, WHO, has made it very clear that female genital mutilation brings no health benefit, only harm. Dr. Chris Fitzpatrick, who is a past Master of the Coombe maternity hospital, has said that female genital mutilation only brings pain, future infection and difficulty with childbirth. FGM is a heinous act that has been outlawed in this country by my Bill, which I am very proud to have brought into this House and have passed. Furthermore, it is illegal, lest there be any doubt, for anyone in this country to take a woman or a child out of this country for the purpose of performing such procedures elsewhere. These are criminal acts and these are criminal people. Let no one claim ignorance of the law as a defence because such an excuse does not stand up.

Today, I would like to refer to Irish charities. I believe that more of them are not publishing financial information on their sources of revenue and how they spend them. The majority of charities do vital work on behalf of the Government and the general public. Increasingly, some charities avail of an exemption that permits them to file an abridged version of accounts with the Companies Registration Office. Abridged accounts show no information on income or expenditure.  The charitable organisations cover a wide spectrum and receive a substantial amount of funding from the Government and the general public. This matter is of great concern and it is a question of public interest. We have had problems with the charity sector in the past. Moneys have been stolen, wrongly spent and inadequately managed, to put it mildly. The Government gives almost €6 billion to about 3,000 Irish non-profit organisations in this country. That amount of money does not include public donations. I do not know how much money is donated by the public because we cannot get much information from the regulatory office. In terms of auditing, the law states that charities do not have to supply information. The charities that avail of the exemption should consider their wider responsibilities to stakeholders.  I ask the Government to revisit this matter and strengthen the legislation on regulation. As one person has put it, how can charities ask us to trust them more when they tell us less?

I agree with a lot of what Senator Wilson said in his contribution. Some councillors have had a pay increase while others have not. There are also vouched and unvouched expenses. The pay and conditions for councillors seem to be all over the place. Therefore, we need a proper debate on the current situation with the Minister in attendance. We are probably 15 or 16 months away from the local elections and people in constituencies all over the country are trying to persuade people to participate. If pay and conditions are not addressed now then I suggest that a high proportion of councillors will decide not to run again and many new young people will be discouraged from becoming a councillor. Councillors work long hours every week, including weekends. They attend meetings, meet constituents and travel all over large constituencies. Such work does not make financial sense and it is not right that a person who works long hours ends up owing money. I am in contact with councillors on a daily basis so know that they are unhappy with the situation.It should not be the case that only somebody who is retired and looking for something to do or somebody who is financially well off can run for election to local government. One should get a proper day's pay for a day's work. I ask the Leader to invite the relevant Minister, be it the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, or the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, to the House to give us an update on the current position with councillors' pay and conditions. It must be dealt with now.

I wish to raise two issues with the Leader. One is the outrageous move by the Department of Education and Skills to place a cap for some reason on the enrolment of five Educate Together primary schools across the country. I have been contacted by a number of parents and local representatives in New Ross, Tramore, Trim, Castlebar and Tuam, all of whom are perplexed as to why the Department has decided to place a 13 student cap on the enrolment numbers for next September for each of these Educate Together schools. It is quite surprising considering that in the last number of years there was a large roll-out of Educate Together schools across the country under the former Ministers, Ruairí Quinn and Jan O'Sullivan. Plebiscites were held in most parts of the country to find out, for the first time, the type of patronage model that interested most parents and much to the surprise of some, although not to people in the Labour Party, many parents were interested in the multi-denominational model. A number of schools were subsequently established. However, now the schools in New Ross, Tramore, Trim, Castlebar and Tuam are being told they can only take in 13 pupils from September. I wonder if there is some type of institutional bias in the Department against these schools because no other patronage schools are being asked to put a cap on their numbers. I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate in the Seanad with the Minister for Education and Skills on this important issue. A number of parents are quite disturbed by this development. Second, I wish to raise the Children's Rights Alliance Report Card 2018. To be fair, and I try to be fair in my deliberations here, many of the grades the Children's Rights Alliance has given the Government have improved from last year. That should be acknowledged. However, two issues arise from the report and it would be interesting to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to the House to discuss them. One is child and family homelessness, for which a grade E has been given by the Children's Rights Alliance. There are many grades to show that the Government is clearly delivering, which is commendable, but on the issue of child homelessness it is an E grade for the second year in a row from the Children's Rights Alliance, which is a reputable organisation. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should be invited to the House to discuss that. The second issue in the report is general practitioner, GP, care for children. The last Government introduced free GP care for every child in the Republic under six years of age and we expected that it would be extended to every child under 12 years of age within a short period of time. Now the Minister is talking about a flat fee of perhaps €5 or €10 for every visit, which we would flatly oppose. Perhaps the Leader would respond on those three issues; the roll-out of free GP care for children between six and 12 years of age; the issue of child and family homelessness; and the pertinent issue of the day, the crazy cap that has been placed on enrolment in Educate Together schools in five areas of the country.
#GerryHorkan	unknown-#GerryHorkan-party	unknown-#GerryHorkan-dob	unknown-#GerryHorkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	38	I second Senator Wilson's proposed amendment to the Order of Business. I support his comments and those of Senator McFadden on councillors' pay and conditions. The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, was in the Seanad before Christmas to announce these proposals and Senators were writing to councillors to congratulate them on what they were getting and accepting praise for all that they were delivering. However, then people realised that their allowances were being cut. I agree with Senator McFadden that we need to know what is happening.We need an analysis of every single one of the 949 people involved in local government, right across the 31 local authorities. We need to see what is happening. We have significant anecdotal evidence of people suffering a significant drop in their subsistence and mileage rates. The system is very cumbersome. If a councillor is on an education and training board, a regional assembly, a health forum or a member of the AILG, the mileage rate changes over mileage terms. It means one has to seek different rates from the different authorities and account for all of this. Let us remember that a councillor is effectively a one person operation. Councillors answer their own phone calls and respond to emails. They do not have secretarial support, funded or otherwise, and if they do it is out of their own pocket. It is very important that we acknowledge the work they do. The vast major of local authority members serve their community and are not in the role for the money. Very few people will get involved with the level of work required for €16,000 a year and a modest level of expenses. Why are members of the local authorities the only people in the entire public service who do not get a pension at the end of their service? If one does ten hours work a week in a part-time position for a number of years in a local authority, that service in pensionable. One will have a very small pension based on a very small salary. Councillors' pensions would not be expensive because they are not earning a lot of money to start with.  It is important that we acknowledge that people are contributing. Some councillors are serving since 1967, some since 1974, and others were elected more recently. They are not there for the money but should be entitled to a pension based on their years of service over many years. Councillors give up hours, weekends and evenings week in, week out to go to various functions and residents' meetings. They are not compensated in any way for those things and they go because they want to go. We should not leave people out of pocket. I came from a meeting with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, about public sector reform. He knows of a local authority that only has one ratepayer. We want to have a local authority membership representative of the area in which they live and we need to facilitate councillors with appropriate meeting times, an appropriate level of secretarial support, appropriate remuneration and compensation for expenses, and ultimately an appropriate pension based on the service they gave. I ask the Leader to raise the issue of pensions for councillors with the Minister.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	39	I agree with the points made by my colleagues on the question of councillor's pay. We have all raised this issue in our own parties in the past 12 months to two years. While councillors get travelling expenses for travelling to council meetings, what is not taken into account are all the other meetings that they attend. I know there are councillors in the Gallery and I welcome those present. Some councillors from west Cork, the Cathaoirleach's constituency, are present. By the time they leave County Cork they are half way to Dublin and that is the extent of the travel they have to do. From Bantry in west Cork to Cork County Hall is not a short trip. One of the councillors identified to me that yesterday morning it took them two and a half hours to travel to Cork County Hall. No one compensates them for the two and a half hours that they spend driving to get there and another two and a half hours to get home. That is not taken into account, together with all the other meetings they attend throughout the week. That is the reason the issue of councillors' expenses has been very much simplified about being paid just to attend council meetings without taking all the other issues into account. That needs to be dealt with. My colleagues are correct that we will have difficulties because of the upturn in the economy and the demands that are now on everybody who holds down a job. I can remember quite clearly when I was on Cork City Council, which is one of the councils that hold their meetings in the evening, whereas most other councils meet during the day. There was only one other councillor in addition to me who was a ratepayer to the city council at that time.That imbalance in respect of the composition of councils is one of the problems we now have and it is all because we cannot get people. We will have further difficulty in that regard in the next few years. It is something we need to seriously consider. I would like to briefly touch on the issue of Versatis. The wrong decision was taken in this regard. Mixed messages are being sent. There is a very simple way of dealing with this. We should allow those people to whom it has already been prescribed continue on with it, although perhaps efforts should be made to phase it out of their treatment. New patients should go through the new system which has been introduced, rather than introducing the new system for everyone. This decision was wrong, poorly planned and it was not thought out. Many people are going through very difficult times as a result. We have heard them on the radio and in the media over the last week. Their views on how this issue is managed should be taken into account. We should invite the Minister to the House to talk to him about dealing with it.

This issue has been highlighted in this House over a long period of time. Despite promises by several Ministers that the issue would be addressed, it has not been. The issue of councillors' pay has been ongoing for years. Councillors receive a representational payment of €16,565. That breaks down to €318.56 per week and it is subject to PAYE, PRSI and USC. If one takes the gross figure of €318.56, and assumes that the average councillor works 40 hours a week, it comes to €7.90 per hour. Most of the time these hours will be unsociable - weekends and evenings. Speaking to and knowing many councillors, I know that they work far in excess of 40 hours per week. It might be 50 or 60 hours a week. If a councillor were to work 60 hours a week his or her gross earnings would be €5.31 an hour. The issue is far from being sufficiently addressed. That is because the Minister, or indeed any sitting Government, does not feel that dealing with this issue will be popular. What they are doing, however, is undervaluing and selling out our democracy. Councillors are at the front line of Ireland's democratic process. If someone has a query on the street which they want addressed and if the council system is not working, that person goes to his or her local councillor to get it addressed. If we want a functioning democracy, and if we truly value democracy in the local government sector, we need to resource the councillors effectively. We have chief executive officers running around the country claiming expenses and it is never reported. Why? Because they are the permanent government. It is about time that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government comes to this House and explains what he is going to do once and for all because there has been report after report and analysis after analysis and the issue has still not been addressed. I hope that the Senators on the Government side will support this motion and compel the Minister to address this long overdue issue once and for all.

We can all agree that artists, writers and performers should be supported to produce their work. While the artists' social welfare pilot scheme is a very welcome initiative and long overdue, the current pilot unfortunately fails to recognise artists as self-employed and aligns itself closer to a jobseeker's model of social welfare. In reality there are few jobs for artists. There is none listed in the employment sections of our newspapers or online. Under the scheme, writers and visual artists can only receive jobseeker's allowance for up to a year without being, as it were, activated. The individual artist or writer therefore only has 12 months to complete his or her work before being required to find alternative work, of which there is none.Therefore, the individual artist or writer has just 12 months in which to complete his or her work before he or she is required to find alternative work, of which there is none. Such a timeframe does not reflect the reality of working life for visual artists and writers. I suggest the scheme needs to be restructured to be inclusive of artists, rather than treating them as jobseekers as they work. Sinn Féin is concerned that it is proposed to review the scheme after a year in light of the low rate of response to it. Just 24 artists have availed of this pilot scheme to date. Separately, the scheme should be extended to performing artists, including performers and musicians. The Government needs to explain why they have been excluded from the scheme. It is by consulting the cultural sector and exploring successful artist welfare schemes in other EU member states that Ireland can establish best practice and create a scheme that enjoys the confidence of artists and supports those who are struggling to make ends meet. I would like the new Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to address the House on this issue.

For example, I do not think we should have done away with ministerial cars. We get no gratitude for that kind of thing. It produces a nexus. If we are going to degrade ourselves, how is the public supposed to feel about us? I do not think this is party political. It has gone on for years. We hear it in the way people speak about the Seanad and the Dáil. The Seanad is seen as a crèche or a retirement home. I think we need to have a good look at this as a profession. Councillors are professionals and they need to be treated as such. I do not know of any other profession in which someone would proudly issue a press release announcing that he or she is not going to accept expenses to go to meetings. It is a joke. This is happening across the board. Soon it will go back to the way it was at the beginning, when privileged people were involved in politics.

Do we want that? No, we do not. There is a consultative process and a review going on at the moment. I would be very hopeful. As Senators, we have a unique nexus to councillors. Obviously, we rely on them for votes. We appreciate them. We have a connection to them. I am in contact with certain councillors all the time. It is very important. I do not want to go over the points that others have made about pensions and other things that we all take for granted. It has been said in here 100 or perhaps 1,000 times that councillors are overworked and underpaid. Something has to be done about it. I will hear what the Leader says when he responds, but I assume we have no choice other than to wait for the Minister to come back to us. I hope that as a former councillor and two-term Senator, the Minister will come back with a positive result for us. He needs to set out what is going to be done to improve things. When I was on the last Seanad campaign, I came across a number of councillors who were wondering why they were bothering. It was not an idle threat. They were genuinely questioning why they were doing this. In light of the amount of abuse we get, never mind the pay and conditions aspect of things, can any of us honestly say we would be involved in politics and the lifestyle associated with it if we were not afflicted with a form of madness that means we are addicted to the process of trying to do good for people? I could go on all day about it. I support what others have said. I understand that an amendment to the Order of Business, as opposed to a motion, has been tabled to address this issue. I have no doubt that we are all on the same page with regard to it.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	49	According to a report on "Morning Ireland" today, rents have increased by up to 15% across the country. I have raised on numerous occasions the effects that short-term lettings such as those facilitated by Airbnb are having on the rental sector. Up to 3,500 units in the Dublin region that should be available for rental by ordinary working people have been moved into the hospitality sector.I continually raise the point that the solution lies in legislation and regulation. This issue was dealt with in Berlin two years ago and last Friday the report reviewing the legislation introduced there was published. That initiative brought 4,000 units in central Berlin back into the rental market, reduced rents in the city and, above all, allowed 4,000 families to obtain accommodation. I have being raising this issue for the past 18 months. The previous Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, set up a working group, as did the current Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. Each working group was supposed to report by the end of 2017 but there has been no sign of those reports. They only met five times during the year, so they must be working very diligently. In the meantime, there are constant excuses from the Government about a supply problem. We repeatedly hear reports about increasing rents and that we need more supply. This is a very simple and easy method to get more supply in our urban areas. The issue does not just affect Dublin and is having the same effect in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Killarney, etc. We have to make a decision. This is not a zero-sum equation. The effect of removing apartments and houses designed for working families from the tourist market and back to their original usage is that we will lose hotel or bed spaces for tourists. I want working families in permanent accommodation rather than hotels and I want the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come to the House and report on why he has failed to take action in respect of this scandal. There are representatives of the tourism industry on the working group. They have skin in the game and want to keep those 5,000 apartments and houses as Airbnb or short-term lets rather than their being reallocated to ordinary working families. I want there to be less talk and more action and for the Minister to come to the House to explain why there has been no action on this issue.

I get no pleasure from saying that the Government's treatment of hardworking local authority members throughout the country has been degrading and insulting and needs to be tackled once and for all. That is the least they deserve. I wish to propose an amendment to today's Order of Business such that the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, would come to the House to discuss the 31 proposed job losses at Kerry Foods in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan. With any news of job losses, our first thought is of those affected and their families, all of whom have mortgages and financial obligations to sustain. The company management indicated that the potential job losses are due to Brexit and the resultant weakness of sterling. The loss of 31 jobs would be a huge blow to a town such as Carrickmacross, as all Senators will appreciate. It is even more worrying that the potential losses are in the food sector, which is vitally important to a county such as Monaghan because so many jobs in sectors such as mushrooms, poultry and general agriculture are dependent on it. This should not be happening under the nose of the Government. We have been calling for job creation in counties such as Monaghan but those calls have fallen on deaf ears. The Government has not been listening. Recent figures from IDA Ireland indicate that it only conducted one site visit in County Monaghan last year, while there were two in County Cavan. Job creation is not happening in Monaghan. The even more important issue of job retention does not seem to be key either.It is important that the Minister would come into the House and outline the current situation in respect of Kerry Foods, the future of that plant and its 600 plus jobs in a town like Carrickmacross, and what the Government is doing to Brexit proof counties like Monaghan that are so dependent on the agricultural sector and food production.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	51	I listened with great interest to Senator Humphreys discussing the challenges in the housing sector, particularly for those who are renting. The natural progression for a lot of people is to go on to purchase their home, yet this is becoming increasingly difficult. The situation that existed during the run-in to and peak of the Celtic tiger is beginning to manifest itself again, namely, gazumping. I have heard from a number of people recently who had gone "sale agreed" with a booking deposit paid to an auctioneer and were told somebody else had come in with a higher bid. I do not think it is good enough. In other countries, once one has paid a booking deposit, if somebody decides to withdraw from the sale and then put the property back on the market, there has to be a six or 12-month period before that can happen. We need to do something on gazumping. It was a serious issue between 2006 and 2008 and is becoming an issue again. Deputy Noel Rock had a transparency Bill in this regard at one stage. I know the Government is planning to do something. It would, however, be in order to bring the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government or the Minister for Finance to the House for statements on the issues of gazumping and people trying to purchase their homes. We should hear what the overall plan is to deal with this scourge. It is terrible for a young couple or anybody who has a booking deposit down on a house to get a phone call a week later to say the sale is not agreed because somebody is after coming in with a higher bid, and to be asked if they can either match or improve on that offer. That type of skullduggery went on too often and too long for too many people in this country. It really has to stop.

Now is the time to start dealing with these issues. We have lost a lot of jobs already in the mushroom industry and, with the announcement of imminent job losses in Monaghan, this is Brexit coming at us. We are all talking about it and posturing but it is time to stop the rot. It is vitally important when we hear of 31 jobs being lost in Monaghan. At this early stage in the negotiations, as people will say, there has to be immediate proactive action taken. I compliment my colleague, Senator Wilson, on raising the issue of councillors' pay and conditions. It is great to see him getting all-round support. The issue needs to be addressed. The record will show that I flagged this on the day the Minister was here previously and warned that councillors were going to lose more money than they would gain. I wish to raise a very pressing issue within the agriculture sector which has to do with the clean livestock policy. People will be aware that there is a clean livestock policy whereby animals being presented for slaughter in abattoirs and processing plants need to be presented in a relatively clean fashion or they will be categorised and may not be allowed into the food chain because of the possibility of contamination of the meat. The clean sheep policy was only introduced in recent weeks. In the week gone by there has been unbelievable confusion about the interpretation of this policy. There is no consideration being taken of the fact that the majority of sheep, unlike cattle, are finished and fattened outside in the pastures. With the wet year we have had, it is almost impossible to have them to the standards that are being expected. The Minister needs to intervene immediately. Kepak stopped slaughter of lambs during the week and is sending home the vast majority of the sheep that are presented. Some farmers have shorn their sheep to bring them to slaughter, which has to be an animal welfare issue in the month of February with the weather we are having at the moment.It cannot be allowed to continue. As I said, now is the time to intervene in the situation. The Minister needs to take immediate action. The situation is being misinterpreted. There needs to be a practical and realistic approach taken.

It is something that has to be urgently discussed. When the Minister came to the House, we discussed the €2,500 in unvouched expenses. I took it that he agreed to look at the extra €2,500 in additional expenses from then on. However, when the legislation came through there was a hard choice. One either took the existing €2,500 or the €5,000 had to be fully vouched. That was not our understanding of the position. It was not in good faith and was not what was said off the record. We were very disappointed. Councillors' pay has always been linked to that of Senators. If that holds true which, I understand, is their legal right, their basic pay would be a minimum of €23,000. The Minister discussed the issue and gave an undertaking under the review to possibly tie the pay of councillors to a Civil Service rate. It is something we did not hear about under the review. The Minister could certainly brush up on three areas. To say that anyone would be in a worse position following the negotiations beggars belief.

I must be impartial and independent in the Chair, but I read a book on the history of Cork County Council from 1899 to 1999. It is the first time in almost 120 years that the peninsula area of Cork, including Mizen Head, Sheep's Head, the Beara Peninsula and so on has no representation. It begs the question as to why that is the case. It is an unusual situation. It is not good for rural Ireland. I met someone recently who lives on Bere Island, and has to travel by boat to Castletownbere and then travel 32 miles to meet a public representative. The quota of almost 3,500 votes in that area is quite extraordinary given the geographic size of the constituency. Had the figure been 1,700 the last time, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin would each have a representative and Independents and other parties would have greater representation. For six inhabited islands and three very big peninsulas to have no representation means something is radically wrong. I cannot comment any further.  Perhaps the constitutionality of representation in Ireland could be looked at. Even sparsely populated states like Arizona and Alaska are guaranteed two senators in the United States. Sometimes parts of rural Ireland are guaranteed no representation. There must be something radically wrong. With those balanced comments, I call on the Leader to respond.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	57	The Cathaoirleach was very balanced. I welcome former Deputy, and current councillor, Gerard Murphy, and Councillors Mary Hegarty, Joe Carroll and Patrick Murphy to the Chamber. I will address the issues of councillors' pay and conditions as part of my reply. Senators Ardagh, Conway and Humphreys raised the issue of housing and the daft.ie report. For any politician to come in here and say that he or she has no confidence in Rebuilding Ireland beggars belief. It is a cross-departmental multiannual approach providing Government funding of €6 billion. It is extraordinary that people would come in here and criticise Government investment in housing. Fianna Fáil was the party which collapsed the construction sector.I know Senator Gallagher does not want to hear a history lesson again, but that is the reality. Let me reassure Senator Humphreys that the party I belong to and represent wants to see all working families housed and in their own homes, or in houses provided by local authorities under the social housing building scheme. The daft.ie report from today is, as Government has said, a reminder that we have challenges to face in the housing sector. We must have an honest debate around housing as well. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, and the Taoiseach are committed to the Rebuilding Ireland programme. In the city and county of Cork, where I live, we can see the hoardings of Rebuilding Ireland and the bricks and mortar being used at key sites. We have to increase supply, and we have to get the balance between landlords and social housing correct.  I accept there are challenges to be met, but the Government has prioritised Rebuilding Ireland and the funding and construction of social housing and has provided incentives to keep landlords as part of the construction and housing model. There are some people in this House who do not want any landlords involved in social housing and some who do not want any private developer building, but would prefer all housing to be under State control. We need an amalgam of all of these options, and that is why the Government has committed to Rebuilding Ireland. It has prioritised a range of measures under that programme, including the rent pressure zones. The daft.ie report does not cover the whole year. Rents in some places have not exponentially increased. In some parts of the country, where we have colleges and universities, we have seen an increase in the building of student accommodation. When Fianna Fáil was in government, it did not make it obligatory for colleges to provide student accommodation; it was left to the individual or the private landlord sector to do that. Let us have a real, honest debate about housing. Senators should not come in here every day and politicise the issue. I accept that meeting the housing need is challenging, but let us work on it in a collective manner, rather than criticising the Government for doing nothing at all. The Government is doing something about this problem. That is a fact. The guidelines the Residential Tenancies Board has put forward and the changes that have been made show that there are pressures, but the pressures will be met by increasing supply.  I agree with Senator Ardagh and Senator Colm Burke regarding the Versatis drug. I heard the remarks of the chief executive of the HSE at the Joint Committee on Health where he said at one level that there was no change, but then we saw the change happening. It affects a very small number of people. The important point is that there are other equivalent medications available that can be taken, but Senator Ardagh and Senator Colm Burke rightly say that it is important to ensure that the cohort of people who require this important drug are able to get it. It is important, and it is incumbent on the HSE and the Minister to come together to ensure this drug is available. I also believe that if the company which manufactures the drug was to consider reducing the cost, it might become more readily available. That is an argument we must have in terms of how the prices in our drugs basket are continually monitored. The Minister should come to the House for that debate.  Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the electoral commission. It is part of the programme for Government. He also raised the issue of Rebuilding Ireland. It is important to recognise that as part of the programme for Government there is a commitment to include a new commission to examine the whole operation of our electoral system. Many of us who have spoken on this issue in the past would welcome the appointment of an independent electoral commission to oversee the operations of our elections. It is not just about political parties being registered, or about funding, but the role of politics and how it operates in our country. We should all welcome that. I would be happy to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, to the House to discuss the matter raised by Senator Boyhan.I will let him speak tomorrow on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016.  Senator Ó Donnghaile has raised the matter of Ms Emma de Souza. As the Senator rightly said, she is an Irish citizen, and under the Good Friday Agreement she has certain rights. As a matter of urgency, perhaps a Commencement matter might be a more expeditious way of getting an answer, but I think the matter raised by the Senator is one that will raise its head further-----

I will not oppose the Order of Business, but I will outline to Senator Wilson and the House that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy John Paul Phelan, is travelling on Government business this week. This is a fundamental question for the body politic. While Senator Boyhan spoke about the importance of the Electoral Commission, I am firmly of the view, having been a member, that the role of the local authority is the central role in our system of politics. Senators Wilson and O'Donnell are right. As Senator McFadden said, it is important to place a value on the role of local representatives at local authority level. I do not just mean a monetary value, though that is important, but a real political value. What they do on a daily basis, and on a statutory basis, underpins the importance of what we will see on Friday with the national development plan and the publication, examination and scrutiny of county development plans. The work that they do is important. In this House, we fundamentally agree that what we are all trying to achieve is to have the pay and conditions for councillors that are called for in Senator Wilson's motion accepted by the Government and implemented.  I will not go over the debate around this part of the Order of Business other than to agree that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, will come to the House next week. He is not available this week. He will find consensus and agreement within the Fine Gael Party. We have been working with him, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. I know that the Fine Gael councillors' representative group has met with Deputy Phelan, and last week met with the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste.  As the Cathaoirleach said in his introduction to my reply, it is fundamentally wrong that someone from the Mizen Peninsula, Castletownbere or Bantry who is a dedicated member of a local authority serving on several boards, such as the education and training board, the strategic policy committee, SPC, or whatever, should be out of pocket for the expenses of travelling to do the duty he or she has been elected to do. Equally, it is wrong for people to have to serve on an interview panel without being facilitated by pay and conditions that constitute fair remuneration. As Senator Ó Domhnaill said, no other person would be put in that position. I believe that as a body politic we must stand up for ourselves.In the past we did not do so, such as when Fianna Fáil, with Brian Lenihan as Minister, cut expenses and allowances. We must, collectively and irrespective of our political differences and ideology, stand up for each other as professionals. I do not care if we are ridiculed tomorrow by the Fourth Estate because I know, from my time as a member of a local authority, that the role of politicians is both important and fundamental in the context of our democracy. I have been in contact with the office of the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, who is away this week. If Senator Wilson agrees, I would be happy to have the Minister of State come to the House at a later date. Senator Reilly raised the issue of female genital mutilation and female circumcision. I chaired the health committee which carried out pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill in 2012. It is unacceptable. It is not a medical procedure but is mutilation and it should not be accepted in any way.

Senator Devine raised the issue of Irish charities and I saw the article by Patricia Quinn on thejournal.ie. I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss charities. We would all agree that there is a need for transparency in the publication of the accounts of charities. I welcome back Senator Warfield. I fully agree with him about our artists and on the need for welfare that represents a broad-brush approach to them because only a small cadre get payments. I would welcome it being extended and I know that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, are deeply committed to this. I look forward to having that debate in due course. Senator Gallagher proposed an amendment to the Order of Business. The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is not available today but I would be happy for her to come to the House after Private Members' business tomorrow night. The Senator failed to recognise that unemployment in Monaghan is down by 15.3% since this Government came to office, while in Cavan it is down by 16%. Senator Paul Daly spoke about agriculture and a clean lifestyle, both of which deserve further debate. I would be happy for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to come to the House to discuss slaughterhouses. If Senator Wilson accepts that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, will come to the House at a later date and if Senator Gallagher accepts that the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation will be here tomorrow night, there should be no votes. However, I will oppose the Senators' amendments if it comes to it.

I am sure this House strongly supports the overarching objective of the NBP to provide this basic necessity to every premises in Ireland. It is a vital utility that is fundamental to sectors, including business, education and agriculture, and a key element for social and economic development. Senators will no doubt be aware of the recent Dáil debates and media coverage on the NBP arising from Eir's decision to withdraw from the procurement process. They will have received copies of all the relevant correspondence and comprehensive briefing documents. I would like to reaffirm today that the NBP remains a top priority of Government and a personal commitment from me to put every placename in every county on the digital map. The NBP procurement team and I are confident that the process can continue and will achieve an outcome that will deliver high-speed broadband throughout Ireland as efficiently as possible. While at this point the NBP procurement team has a single bidder following the withdrawal of two bidders for commercial reasons, the remaining consortium led by SSE-Enet is an experienced consortium with international expertise. It has already identified its final issues for discussion with the Department's team and this list was submitted some weeks ago while competition remained in the process.  A narrative that has emerged is that the procurement process is overly-onerous and complex. Of course, this is an onerous and complex process as we will be spending hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money to deliver a future-proofed, high-speed broadband network throughout the country. The competitive dialogue procurement procedure which we are using is common practice internationally for projects of this nature and complexity. It enables, not inhibits, greater participation throughout the process. The procurement process opens up a dialogue with selected candidates in order to identify and define the means best suited to deliver a national broadband plan. It is important to point out that a bidder cannot go backwards on matters.The competitive dialogue procedure was also used for the procurement of the next generation broadband project in Northern Ireland and the BDUK superfast broadband project in Oxfordshire, and is used for public private partnerships in Ireland. I understand the frustration of people who are watching the procurement process and waiting for it to conclude but who, in the meantime, are left without access to high-speed broadband, and I thank them for their patience. I can assure Members that I will not let this procurement process continue for one minute longer than is absolutely necessary. As the procurement process proceeds through the final stages, I will ensure that this House and its Members are regularly updated on the progress in delivering the objectives of the national broadband plan. The State-led intervention and its procurement process is one element of the multifaceted national broadband plan working together to deliver a digital Ireland. The plan aims not just to intervene in the market but also stimulate commercial investment. To date, commercial investment of €2 million is continuing to deliver improved broadband services every single day, reducing Ireland's digital divide. That increased level of investment by commercial operators certainly has been influenced by the commitments outlined in the national broadband plan. When I first took office, just over five in every ten premises had broadband. At the end of last year, that was nearly seven in every ten and, by the end of 2018, it will be nearly eight in every ten. By the end of 2018, it is envisaged that 79% of the population, 87% of schools and 96% of business parks will have access to high-speed broadband. In the past 12 months alone, new telecommunications infrastructure has been delivered to over 280,000 premises providing high-speed broadband services of up to 1 Gbit per second download speeds. In addition, the Eir rural 300,000 roll-out will deliver high-speed broadband to 810,000 people, one third of farms in the country and over 1,000 schools by the end of this year. I appreciate that the increase in commercial investment is of little solace to the 990,000 or so citizens who will not be served by those commercial operators. However, the State intervention and the procurement process will provide those citizens with high-speed broadband access, regardless of location, and that will be future proofed for the next 25 years. The intervention area will provide broadband to: 542,000 postal addresses; 990,000 citizens or 21% of the population; 381,000 members of the labour force; 52,057 farms or 61% of the total number of farms; 47,096 small and medium businesses, primarily micro-business; 437 or 13% of schools; and 310 business parks or 4% of the national total of business parks. Significant progress is also being made across a number of areas to ensure efficient and effective delivery of the national broadband plan. I established the mobile phone and broadband task force in July 2016 in line with a commitment I had written into A Programme for A Partnership Government. The task force identifies solutions to potential obstacles faced by the roll out of the national broadband plan and aims to facilitate faster delivery of mobile and wireless broadband solutions across rural Ireland. In fact, the actions taken through the task force report will lead in the coming weeks to very significant announcements by both wireless and mobile operators who are looking to expand the network of broadband services across rural Ireland in the very short term. The task force's annual report will be published shortly and will identify the significant achievements made to date, including the positive impact of the broadband officers operating in each county and local authority. In addition, there are other initiatives under way to maximise and enhance existing connectivity. For example, the release of the 3.6 GHz 5G capable spectrum in May 2017 will enable operators to provide faster fixed wireless and mobile services to customers and, as I said, I expect significant announcements on that in the coming weeks. A total of €8 million is currently being invested to facilitate the reallocation of the 700 Mhz spectrum away from TV broadcasting to support broadband and mobile telephony plans in rural areas. This means that valuable spectrum band is being freed up to deliver better mobile data services in rural areas. As this process concludes I will ensure that Members of this House are kept up to date. I will continue to arrange special information sessions for Deputies and Senators as I have done on three occasions in the past ten months. I will ensure also that citizens can get information on the availability of high-speed broadband through my Department’s website, the dedicated in-box, including in particular the interactive high-speed broadband map. The national broadband plan will deliver high-speed broadband to all premises throughout Ireland, both urban and rural. Although it has been a challenging and complex process, it is coming to an end. The Government and the Department remain committed to concluding this procurement process and we are confident that we will achieve a robust, future-proof contract that will enable the efficient roll-out of high-speed broadband throughout the country.

I will try to speak louder and get closer to the microphone. The Minister was a Minister in 2016 but he was not a Fine Gael Minister. I believe he was handed a very difficult task. The Minister accepted that task and, fair dues to him, he had high aspirations about what he could achieve. The Taoiseach at the time probably knew it was a hot potato, so to speak, when he handed it to him and said, "Here. Take it and run with it". However, what has happened in the past 17 years since all those promises were made is a sorry state of affairs. What he has lost now, however, with the withdrawal of Eir, is a very serious player because it controls much of the hardware including poles and so on throughout the countryside, which I believe will be required for the roll-out of broadband. Like Lee Harvey Oswald, the Minister could be the patsy in this situation and might be blamed for something for which he is not responsible. I hope the Fine Gael-led Government is giving him support in that regard because it appears to me that it is a series of disasters. The Minister is now down to one tenderer. All the deadlines were missed and now he has refused to provide a date by which the contract will be awarded. It will take a further three to five years to build the network. The Taoiseach stated recently that the Government would seek to have 75% of homes connected by the end of 2018. Essentially, the Government is abandoning homes where State support is needed. In his contribution, the Minister said that 900,000 citizens are affected. He further stated that, in addition, the Eir roll-out to 300,000 premises will deliver high-speed broadband to 810,000 people, one third of farms and over 1,000 schools. In respect of farms, the Minister might inform his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that it is very difficult for farmers - the Minister has disappeared. He was in his seat one minute and, like a rabbit out of a hat, there is a Minister of State in his place. Without bid or say, he was gone.

To give the Minister an idea of what happened in the past, when we were last in government, which is a while ago now, we provided broadband to 234,000 homes and businesses across the country. We met 100% of the target at that time, and we must remember that technology was different then. We have been consistently appalled by the neglectful stance the Government has taken towards the provision of broadband to rural homes and businesses, which are struggling to survive in an increasingly digital era. Last week in the Dáil, Fianna Fáil brought forward a motion to remind the Government of the broken commitments to rural Ireland and called for a swift review of the tendering process to date. That motion was passed with cross-party support. It is very important that there be an evaluation of what is going on at present. The Government's national rural broadband roll-out is a shambles. The tendering process started in 2015 - three years ago - and it has dragged its heels. Two bidders have withdrawn and there is now only one bidder remaining in the process, namely, Enet. Will Enet have access to the Eir network? We do not know what negotiations are taking place. In September 2017, SIRO, a collaboration between ESB and Vodafone, withdrew owing to the lengthy and complicated tendering process, something which should have triggered alarm bells for the Government at the time. In January 2018, Eir, another large and experienced operator, pulled out of the process. Fianna Fáil supports the roll out to all households and businesses of access to fibre-optic broadband capable of providing up to 1 Gbit per second in download speeds. It is essential infrastructure. Fibre broadband to homes is key to bridging rural Ireland's digital deficit. In some rural areas companies are already deploying fibre-optic cable rather than copper in the final connection between local exchanges and households and businesses. In light of developments in the future, and the deep concern relating to Brexit, there is nothing more important for rural and urban areas, and industry, than ensuring that we have the most efficient and effective broadband system in the world. I am afraid this Government is incapable of delivering that. It is likely that the general election will be over and gone when Fianna Fáil will probably play a role in the next Government and we will deliver.

I will speak on two main areas in respect of broadband and the earlier statement by the Minister, Deputy Naughten. First, the World Economic Forum has rated Ireland as No. 24 in the world in global competitiveness. It is not bad but not near enough to where we should be. The biggest challenge we face, according to the World Economic Forum, is infrastructure and a big part of that is broadband, along with transport. The second factor is our tax rates. I know that the Government is working on that and I appreciate it. The third factor is Government bureaucracy and the fourth is access to finance. These are four key areas for us to work on. This evening we are discussing broadband and the challenges we face.  Second, a minimum of 30 Mbps is the standard we are looking for. There are 15 counties in Ireland in which less than 50% of premises are connected to broadband at this level. For example, there is Mayo, Waterford, Galway and the midlands.

It is a very significant issue for business. I have to hand a map produced by the European Regional Development Fund from 2017. It says there are 2.3 million premises in Ireland of which 1.4 million, a little more than 50%, can now access high-speed broadband services. The vast majority of those who do not have it are outside the Pale, that is, are outside Dublin. I note that 80% of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, that failed during the recession were outside Dublin. I am not fighting with the Minister of State, or the Department or the Government - far from it - but I am stating the key, critical reason to drive this on as a key Government initiative. I have said before that I and others will support the Government in respect of developing that. The area marked amber on the map to which I refer represents target areas in the State intervention. One can see how much is in the area; it is the vast majority of the country. I did not make this point; this was published by the European Regional Development Fund in the middle of last year.  Those are comments but I have one question. Reliability in broadband is critical. There is no point in having broadband unless it is reliable. It is essential that the Minister of State and his team ensures that we have good reliability for the whole of Ireland. Can he tell us the cost per household or per premises of the installation and the overall cost to the State because we now have only one tenderer in the procurement process? I felt sorry for the Minister when the announcement was made one afternoon a couple of weeks ago that Eir had pulled out. No Minister wants to deal with issues like that and it is not easy. The world I live in involves a lot of key performance indicators, KPIs. The Minister's speech mentioned some figures, and he stated "By the end of 2018, it is envisaged that 79% of the population, 87% of schools and 96% of business parks will have access to high-speed broadband". With respect, 96% of business parks does not mean a lot to businesses because only a fraction of 1% of all businesses will be located in business parks. It is SMEs and businesses, such as those in Moycullen and Spiddal in Connemara, which employ three, four, five or six people, which are the engine of our economy, particularly in rural Ireland. I ask that the Government focus particularly on that area, not just the business parks. That means nothing to me.

The Minister, Deputy Naughten, had to leave for a Cabinet sub-committee meeting but earlier he outlined his vision for the sector and how he intends to address the challenges for us all as a country. I cannot continue without mentioning the irony of listening to Senator Leyden, who represents Fianna Fáil, who criticised the current Government and Minister regarding the challenges in rolling out broadband when the fundamental reason, as we all know, is that it was his party which sold out Telecom Éireann with the essential infrastructure of the ducting, poling and networking 20 years ago, which I remember well.

It is important to put that on record. Nor did Fianna Fáil stop there. Over later years, that party went on to fritter away the progress made in the Irish economy. It was in government when this economy was wrecked, when the construction sector was wrecked and when the banking sector was wrecked. Others have pointed out many reasons as to why broadband is not rolled out to areas as it should be, of which access to credit was one. These are the problems created by Fianna Fáil and the legacy it has left this country. I have to correct Senator Leyden and note the irony and the cheek of his earlier contribution, in which he tried to lay the blame with this Government, which is investing in broadband, has corrected the economy and is bringing this country back to a par in managing its finances.

I have no issue with the legitimate concerns expressed on why Eir withdrew from the recent procurement process which is ongoing. I understand that it was a commercial decision by the company. One must ask why a company such as Eir, which one would think had the capacity and ability to deliver, would do so. I point to the denuding of the asset base of that company over many years. If one considers the recent storm, when much of the Eir network took a battering the company is struggling to address, one can see in any part of the country that it does not have the capacity to fix the existing networks. It does not have the resources to reinvest in the existing networks. I keep pointing to the other semi-State that has been so successful, namely, ESB Networks, which in comparison, has invested enormously in every town, village and rural area in this country because it had a long-term vision of investment for the network. Unfortunately, we did not have the same in our telecommunications networks because the ground was sold out from under them. That is the fundamental reason why we do not have strong broadband connections in Ireland now. As a Government representative, it is not good enough for me to point the finger of blame; we must point to solutions. That is why I have confidence in the Minister, Deputy Naughten, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and in the Government, because they have a plan. They have the national broadband plan that will invest substantial millions of euro in reaching areas where the commercial operators cannot reach. That is to be welcomed. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, already pointed out that when he came into office a couple of years ago, five out of ten premises were connected to quality broadband. That figure will be nine out of ten premises in the next 18 months, which is to be welcomed, but it will only do so by continued investment and co-ordination of all assets and all resources, commercial, private and State, to ensure that the direct fibre connections, in so far as possible, can reach every home. Where direct fibre cannot be reached, we need to use other technologies, such as high-quality wireless technologies. Imagine is already rolling that out in many areas and has made substantial investment in that regard in County Waterford. SIRO, the ESB-Vodafone partnership, is also investing more than €450 million in reaching 500,000 regional homes and businesses.Eir is investing €200 million and has guaranteed that it will connect over 300,000 premises under that investment plan. The majority of these projects are in the regions and rural Ireland. Virgin Media, Imagine and many other providers are doing the same. It is important that the commitment by the previous Government in 2015 of over €275 million is invested in the national broadband plan. This Friday, I expect to hear that this sum is going to be substantially increased under the new national capital plan. We need that type of investment. We need that type of commitment from the very top down and we must provide certainty to the relevant agencies and to the people of rural Ireland - citizens of this country - that the State is behind them. We all understand that we have a substandard broadband network. We all know the reasons for that, but now it is time for all of us to put our shoulders to the wheel to ensure that we deliver a fit-for-purpose, modern broadband network that will serve the needs of our citizens, agricultural businesses and rural areas and the regions into the future. I have confidence that this Government and this Minister can achieve that.

I spent yesterday in Mayo and I could not do something as simple as send an email all day. The truth is that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have failed people in the context of broadband. The facts speak for themselves. We have announcement fatigue. In 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, under Fianna Fáil, and right through the Fine Gael Governments up to today, the fact is that promises have not been delivered upon year after year. Fianna Fáil's motion on broadband was passed in the Dáil last week, but I was surprised that it placed such emphasis on the dangers of privatisation. The dangers associated with the privatisation of telecommunications became a reality in 2000 when one of the key pieces of state-wide infrastructure, Telecom Éireann, was privatised. That was done under a Fianna Fáil Government and it was the start of the rot. It is as simple as that. That is factual. From then on, any planned expansion of the communications network or necessary upgrade work was at the mercy of shareholders and at the whim of the markets. If Fianna Fáil is so good at doing business now, perhaps it would go out and beg the French billionaire who now owns our vital infrastructure to give it back. The ownership of that infrastructure has gone right around the world. We knew we were going to lose control of it but to sell, at that vital time, our country's main telecommunications system was bizarre in the extreme. If I live to be 120, I will never be able to figure that one out. Sinn Féin has repeatedly warned the Government about fundamental flaws in the procurement system it has been operating and about its determination to hand over control of this project to private interests. There is a chance to roll back on this now, however. The Sinn Féin amendment to the Dáil motion last week called for the remainder of the roll-out of broadband to be placed in State ownership. We also want to explore the feasibility of using existing State infrastructure held by the ESB for the future roll-out of broadband. Has the Minister of State considered using the gas pipelines, the railways and the backhaul lines serving the metropolitan area networks as possible infrastructure which could be used in the remaining roll-out of the national broadband plan? Where does the process stand now? We hear announcements regarding the levels of coverage from time to time, but the fact is that the roll-out has only benefited commercial premises so far. We are still at the mercy of commercial entities as to whether we get this vital service. In the absence of the roll-out of the national broadband plan, 61% of farms are outside existing high-speed coverage areas, 437 schools are relying on slow connections and broadband black spots are present in 96% of the land mass of the State. Those of us who are members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach spent the earlier part of this afternoon with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who told us all about eGovernment and the plans in that regard. Those plans are absolutely not compatible with the reality. It will lead to a large part of the country becoming marginalised. We heard from representatives of the banking sector last week who stated that 21% of people do not or cannot do online banking. Very vulnerable communities are being marginalised and we really need to take notice of that. I am of the view that eGovernment should be put on hold until we have proper broadband to ensure that it is inclusive and is not socially and economically excluding vast areas and vast numbers of citizens within the country. In Mayo, the withdrawal of Eir means that 37,046 premises, which are in the AMBER premises intervention sector, are now in complete limbo. This is in a county where one cannot rely on regular, uninterrupted access to high-speed broadband. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for people living in the areas affected. We wait and wait and promises are made, but we are absolutely sick of it at this stage. The reason we agreed with the call for a review of the entire plan is that we genuinely think that there are Ministers in Government who are not aware of the dire circumstances that we are now left in. Are there any guarantees in place for these premises, given that the Government is effectively no longer in control of the bidding process, which now has only one bidder involved? I am afraid that in the desperate rush to save the plan, the Government is prepared to settle for a lesser overall plan. Are there any plans to require all future providers of broadband, including anything that emerges from the wreckage of the current process, to ensure minimum connection speeds? It is not good enough to simply connect people if they cannot then download and upload what they need. For every week and month that an area is without a broadband connection, especially in the rural areas, there are countless business and employment opportunities missed. We are haemorrhaging job opportunities because we do not have broadband. That applies to people who are moving back to rural communities from abroad or people who are interested in setting up new businesses. At its meeting earlier today, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach was informed that there are plans to greatly increase the digitisation of State services, such as those, for example, relating to passport renewal. How will this interruption to the roll-out of the national broadband plan affect the planned digitisation of even more State services? Has the Minister of State considered enhancing the role of local post offices, which could act as points of first connection to high-speed broadband? I really believe that a post office with high-speed broadband could offer more State services and act as a local roll-out point and a hub for the future. It would also ensure the sustainability of post offices going forward. We should be considering a measure such as that.

It is great to have him back in this House. I also acknowledge at the outset the degree to which the Minister of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, has sought to brief, explain and meet with groups, how participative he has been and how thoroughly and democratically he has gone about his business over the last couple of weeks. It is very impressive how he sought to brief us and to meet us and listen to all of the interest groups. I am very proud to be on the relevant committee of the Oireachtas. Providing broadband to every house and premises in this country is an ambition of mammoth proportions. It is a worthy ambition, and is something of which to be very proud. We should not be negative about this. We should be proud that we are setting such a high goal of achievement for the country. It is equivalent to rural electrification. The biggest roadblock it has encountered to date is the selling off of Telecom Éireann by the then Fianna Fáil Government. In retrospect, that is clearly one of the obstacles with which we are dealing. It is not an insurmountable obstacle. The plan is going ahead and I am confident we will deliver the goods.From listening to Senator Conway-Walsh one would almost get the impression that there has not been a huge amount of achievement. It is important to put on the record that at present, 71% of premises and houses right across the country have broadband. Moreover, 79% will have it by the end of this year and 87% of all schools have broadband. That is an extraordinary and good situation to be in. It is also important to note that Eir is committed to delivering to the 300,000 premises to which it has a contractual commitment to deliver and we have been informed by the Minister that will go ahead promptly and is progressing as we speak. That is a very important aspect of the plan. It is important to note that Enet-SSE has already set out its prices to deliver to the missing 542,000 postal addresses in the country. I would like the Minister to clarify that situation. The public would like to hear that Enet will deliver. I am confident it will and it wants to set itself up as a success. The public also want to know that it will do it at the price stated in its initial procurement proposal. I understand that will be the case. I mentioned the successes to date. I would like to record the successes in my native county of Cavan.

Some 17,664 premises have been connected in Cavan and a further 7,329 will be connected by the end of this year. Some 17,664 premises remain to be connected to high-speed broadband, which is too many. We want to get that done and that is why I am speaking about this issue and want assurances from the Minister. I am, however, confident that will happen. I want to be sure that we will do that. The Minister should reassure Members that Enet-SSE will be held to its universal social obligation to go into the hills and backwoods areas in order to make sure that every citizen of this country gets broadband. I also want assurance that we will have control over its programme of activity and will know how, when and where it is being rolled out and what it is doing. Some of the infrastructure has been put in place in each county for that, which is very important. If the Minister were to provide those assurances that would be particularly helpful.  What this will mean for the country merits repetition. It will mean students can study at home or in any location in the country. It will mean significant improvement for farmers and that business can be localised. It has enormous potential for the country and it is the most exciting plan. I need the Minister to tell us it will happen fast and at no extra cost. I ask the Minister to comment on how Eir will be required to give up its poles and infrastructure for use in the provision of broadband, and assure us that nothing will be held back and the pricing will not be exorbitant.

Eir's shareholders are designed to get out every few years and renegotiate. I am not surprised by that because when Eir plagiarised the murmuration of starlings to use in its advertising I knew we were dealing with people who really could negotiate. The ESB is a very well run company and very well respected. However, it is the third most expensive power company of the EU's 27 member states. Maybe it should spend its money figuring out how to drive down the cost of power which would be good for Ireland, industry and entrepreneurs rather than spending it on telecoms. On Enet, it is a truly public-private partnership. It has spent €100 million since it came to Ireland and last year it provided fibre to more premises in three months than SIRO has since its inception. The reason I mention this is because I think there might be a diamond left here. There is a majesty about being the last man standing. The last man standing is Mr. McCourt. He is a wonderful media, telecoms and technological pioneer. He is the owner of Enet. I have read a lot about him in siliconrepublic.com. There was a brilliant write-up about our national broadband, the Irish Government and what will happen next. The whole thing was very well done by Mr. John Kennedy. Mr. McCourt is an entrepreneur with extraordinary skills and accolades. He is also part of Granahan McCourt and chairs Satellite Holdings, LLC. He is understood to be collaborating with Warren Buffett. I say all this because sometimes the last man standing is probably the best. I have very little faith in Eir as an ordinary person with a telephone in my house. The ESB is far too expensive and together with SIRO, has got out of the bidding process. Eir is out. Enet has been left standing and I think Mr. McCourt is the man for the job. It is just an observation. I know there has been an impasse and the situation is difficult. We are trying to get broadband across the country. I suggest that Senators read siliconrepublic.com and learn about the person who is going to take over, in whom I have absolute faith.  I will take up what Senator O'Reilly said. I would like to hear whether the original price of the procurement will remain the same as Enet had in the beginning. It comes with great faith and without a legacy. As Mr. McCourt said:If the competition is non-political [which it is now] we have a good chance. We are in the business of doing exactly what the National Broadband Plan sets out to do and we have perfected the partnership model.He also said:A little-known fact is that Berkshire Hathaway has never sold a company it has bought, ever. It invests in good companies and keeps them for the long run. ... We are a 100pc wholesale open-access player focused on the long term.Senator Leyden should listen to that.  He said he keeps the company for the long run and does not sell it overnight when nobody is looking. This is a majestic diamond. I wish the Minister luck in negotiating with Enet. I think it is going to be excellent. It has been a tough impasse for the Government, but the outcome and result with Mr. David McCourt will be excellent.

I want to contribute to the debate. I refer to delays which have taken place and obstacles of the past six or seven years, which are rooted in the selling of Eircom as a number of other speakers have said. Along with those obstacles, there has been a growing need in business, education and industry for broadband. As other speakers have said, plans will be announced next Friday but the biggest thing which could unlock the potential of rural and urban Ireland is the roll-out of broadband. When Eir pulled out of the process a couple of weeks ago there was a collective view that it was a case of "Here we go again". I was glad that the Minister came out quickly and reassured us that the process was still on track. As Chairman of the committee which dealt with this issue during the lifetime of the previous Government, I am aware at first hand of the significant investment of time, money and expertise put into getting this right for once and for all, and not over-promising but delivering.I welcome the decision to go ahead with the process. Enet-SSE are very competent. Enet provided the metropolitan area network, MAN, in Claremorris, County Mayo, which has been very successful. There was a Fianna Fáil motion on this issue in the Dáil last week but I have no doubt if the Minister had said he would have a review to see how to proceed, there would have been other motions to say it has been held up long enough and asking why can we not go ahead with it. We have gone past playing political football with this. I always had good time for Senator Leyden, who is a very experienced Member of this House, but his contribution today was not appropriate, to put it mildly. We need to get this sorted out and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will get it right once and for all and let us not hear any more about rural and urban divides in this country.

This is too serious to be a political football. I must also correct Senator Leyden on a point of fact. The great national broadband scheme that Fianna Fáil implemented was an absolute failure and a waste of money. That scheme was rolled out to many electoral districts near where I live, including Attymass, which was identified as needing State intervention. The measure of success was that if one house in the electoral district could be said to be connected, the rest were deemed to have access if they chose to have it. In reality, however, one could have been connected up and had access but all the other houses might not. There might be a drumlin between one house and another. That was the national broadband scheme that Fianna Fáil presided over, which Senator Leyden was praising. He should come down to Mayo where I will introduce him to all the people who were given false promises by Fianna Fáil.

It is not just that people cannot get online and it is nice to get online, but that it affects people's households, families and businesses. If we are to fulfil our ambition to make rural Ireland sustainable, the beginning, middle and end of that is broadband. It connects us to the global economy and that is where we have positioned ourselves. This is a small open economy and we must have that access. A lot of work has been done and we have to drive on with this. Reviewing and slowing it down is an absolute nonsense at this juncture. There has been a bidding process and to date it has been a valid process. It allows for a single remaining bidder. There is nothing not catered for or envisaged in the process as it has happened. In a perverse way there could be an advantage to what has happened because, instead of having to go around to several bidders that had been validated, the State now has to deal with one bidder. It can cut to the chase, say what it wants and how it will get it done. This bidder will either do it or not. Parameters have already been established.  I agree with several previous speakers that it must be set out in black and white that Enet and the consortium will not hike up prices and I believe there is provision in the whole process for that. The Minister of State might send out that signal loud and clear. That has to be the most serious and legitimate concern about the process and the Government will not be fleeced for this. I do not believe it will be.  This dumbing down of the consortium, Enet-SSE, is nonsense. The consortium is a serious contender and must always have been seen as the possible successful bidder notwithstanding all the propaganda from Eir. It has professionalism, know-how, innovation and the finances to back it up. I have had some dealings with Enet, which is a private company but has an exemplary track record in delivering public contracts, and I can speak for that in respect of Mayo. There are six towns in Mayo, Ballina, Kiltimagh, Claremorris, Belmullet, Castlebar and Knock, around the airport. Enet has rolled out MANs, which were innovative technology at the time, and, notwithstanding that some of these MANs have been there for several years, there is still capacity on them. As a wholesale provider it has given everyone a fair crack of the whip. It has a track record. There are two global businesses in Claremorris that operate through the MANs, CBE Software and Delta Dental, which have gone out of their way to praise the work of Enet. SSE-Airtricity has a good track record in rural Ireland, compared with many of the other renewable energy companies. Let us have faith and drive on. The Minister should get down to the nuts and bolts with Enet and the consortium as soon as possible, sort out what needs to be done and go on and let us get our long overdue broadband.

There is a massive divide in rural Ireland because of broadband. We live in a digital era where we depend on broadband, in schools, businesses and farming. We need to work together today to create and make sure rural Ireland is not forgotten. Everybody here today forgets that there is a massive divide. Rural Ireland has been forgotten in the national framework plan to 2040. If we do not get broadband sorted we will have a massive problem. Timing is going to be crucial. People shop online, everything is on Facebook and is accessible by phone. We need to make sure we deliver broadband to rural Ireland as soon as possible. When will that be delivered, when will the commitment be given and what timescale is the Minister of State giving us today? That is the vital question. It does not matter what party anyone is in and I have heard all the Senators speak. When will it happen for the 542,000 houses and businesses in rural Ireland that have been totally forgotten?

I do not want to give a history lesson but people cannot rewrite history. I will not allow that. On the issue of broadband, I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State. First, Eir is committed to rolling out broadband for 300,000 customers. Where do matters stand in that regard? This is about getting people access to broadband. What is the position in terms of discussions with Enet to allow the further roll-out of rural broadband? More critically, where is the Government at in its discussions with Eir on the ability to use the network to ensure that it can roll out this broadband quickly? I agree with previous speakers that broadband is now the modern equivalent of the ESB, and we have to roll it out. It is slightly different in that, in some cases, people can access wireless broadband but, in many instances, this is not fast enough. This applies on a myriad of levels, for example, in regard to family life or people working from home. Increasingly, people are spending a day at home or work three days away and two at home. This will allow people to go back and live in rural Ireland. It is the gateway. The key point is that this is about the logistics of rolling out broadband but it also about the finances. First, Eir is committed to rolling this out for 300,000 customers. I will be frank with the Minister of State. Like other speakers, people are ringing me to say they are on the edge of the area served by Eir but that it will not cover them, which is frustrating. This is why we need to have this rolled out quickly, particularly as many of these are people with small businesses in rural areas. Second, when will there be agreement with Eir regarding the use of the network, which is critical? How much will it cost and will Eir abide by the prices that were laid down on day one? Third, what is the position on the negotiations with Enet in order to give transparency regarding how long it will take to roll this out and what are the areas to which it will be rolled out? There is a lack of certainty among the people. They ask, "When is my area going to get broadband?", or "Do I have to get wireless broadband?" The problem is that everyone talks about broadband in a very abstract way. Broadband is very real if a person is sitting at an iPad or computer, waiting hours for a document to download, or if the person cannot connect with high-end industry. Those are my questions. I want to be balanced in this regard. We need to move this from being a negative to being a positive. Let us fast-forward the roll-out but, once again, we must remember the public purse is involved so we must get value for money.

This is not just about the disadvantage of rural Ireland; it is about all of Ireland. It is about ensuring that all people are connected and have the opportunity to work from home or have investment in all parts of Ireland. That is why the Government is committed to the national broadband plan. The hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party last week illustrates why we are where we are today because of the failure of Mary O'Rourke et al. in that Government.

It is important that we do that. It is about ensuring that it is not just about rural Ireland. I want to give Senator Murnane O'Connor a small history and geography lesson. Approximately 9 km from Cork city, 2.5 km from the airport, is a state-of-the-art business park that gives employment and provides a haven for entrepreneurship and innovation. However, 2 km down the road, at Ballygarvan, there is very little in terms of broadband. It is not disadvantaged areas. The Senator should stop this mantra of rural Ireland-----

What we must do is get it right. It is allowing the people who live in the 100 houses at Gleann Alainn to be able to have high-speed broadband so they can do what Senator Kieran O'Donnell spoke about, namely, take a day to work from home, put on Netflix and so on. That is why it is so important. It is about investing and getting it right. If we want to have an honest conversation about where we stand, then the asset stripping of Eircom is a fundamental question that Fianna Fáil Members must address. They should look into their hearts and ask why Eircom was sold off and who benefited from the sale and from the asset stripping down the years. Look at what we have today: an ambitious plan by Government. Of course, we would all like to have multiple competitors willing to invest but we have an independent tendering process. If we did not have it, the Members opposite would come in here waving the Order Paper and calling for all kinds of tribunals. However, we do have it. We have a Minister and a Government willing to try to bring high-speed broadband to every home and then, as a consequence, into every community, so that we can create jobs. Next Friday, we will announce the national development plan. Although I know the Senator does not like good news-----

If Fianna Fáil is so serious about rural Ireland, it would not have voted against the Government last week in the Dáil and it would have supported us in ensuring that we have connectivity. I have every confidence that we will get a national broadband plan that will deliver high-speed broadband. However, the frustration of people is genuine. The people I spoke about are not made up; they are real people who live 9 km from Cork city, 4 km from Cork Airport, who have not got the speed and connectivity they should, although they are not in a disadvantaged rural area. Please, let us use our language properly. Let us ensure that we have an ultimate response for the people whereby we can have investment and jobs that will allow for connectivity, the Internet and whatever anyone wants to have as part of every rural community, including those communities adjacent to cities.However, the history lesson does not wash with Members of the Opposition because they choose to forget.

I am delighted to be here. As the Minister, Deputy Naughten, highlighted, all Senators agree that high-speed broadband is a vital utility for continued economic development in both rural and urban areas across our country. It is clear from listening to the contributions of Senators that this House shares the strong desire of the Government to ensure that all areas, houses, premises, farms and businesses are connected to future-proofed and high-speed broadband and that it is delivered throughout Ireland as soon as possible. The national broadband plan is not just about State intervention but, rather, combines a wide range of activities, some of which fall under my role as Minister of State. Under my portfolio, operators come to the table to engage with local authorities, the Department of Rural and Community Development and the mobile phone and broadband task force to identify issues and obstacles that arise as we embark on connecting all of Ireland. The report on activities for 2017 in that regard will be published next week. All local authorities have a dedicated broadband officer part-funded by my Department, other Departments and all stakeholders in the process, and the work of the broadband office is built on the foundations of the national broadband plan, which is at the core of this issue. The successes of those groups in terms of the work to improve efficiencies in planning applications, waivers in respect of development contributions for telecommunications development and the updating of planning exemptions are necessary measures to smooth the implementation of the roll-out. Work in those areas will continue and it is important to acknowledge that as a vital part of the national broadband plan. As a rural Deputy representing Galway West, which includes parts of south Mayo and rural areas of Connemara, I remind the House that some of my constituents are frustrated with the lack of high-speed broadband in their areas. However, 80% of premises in my constituency will have access to high-speed broadband service by the end of this year. That figure would undoubtedly have been lower had the national broadband plan not been driving commercial investment in recent years. It is important to acknowledge that because there has been much commentary about Eir. Can it be said that Eir has delivered on broadband in recent years? Is there confidence that, absent a national broadband plan or the commitment of all parties in Dáil Éireann and the Government to push the national broadband plan, Eir would have delivered by now or would do so over the coming years? I cannot say it would.

Comment has been made on the contract entered into by the Government with Eir to deliver broadband to 300,000 houses. That is a commitment contract such that if Eir does not deliver connections to those premises, the State can fine it. Deputy Kieran O'Donnell asked about the number of houses that have been connected to date. Connections have been made to approximately 130,000 of the 300,000 houses.

In the past 12 months, telecommunications infrastructure involving high-speed broadband with services of up to 1 GB per second download speed has been delivered to over 280,000 premises. The roll-out of connections to 300,000 premises will deliver for 810,000 people, one third of farms and over 1,000 schools. The completion of the procurement process for the national broadband plan is the only way to ensure the most efficient delivery of high-speed broadband to the people of Ireland. Senator Ó Céidigh mentioned several areas in regard to competitive finance infrastructure, reliability and that it is critical to roll on with the process and connections. I accept that farmers, business people and others awaiting high-speed broadband are frustrated. The role and commitment of the Government is to delivery to the whole of society in the shortest possible timeframe, which is the key priority for the Government. The House will agree that is an admirable and worthy aim. As the Minister, Deputy Naughten, stated, the remaining bidder, Enet-SSE, is an experienced consortium with international experience, as stated by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, and it has re-affirmed its commitment to the national broadband plan project and its intention to deliver in that regard. Senator Conway-Walsh discussed the national broadband plan. The procurement process is entering its final stage and it is for the bidder to promote its solutions and methodology for the roll-out of broadband. The remaining bidder, Enet-SSE, has demonstrated a technical financial methodology for delivery of the national broadband plan for both urban and rural Ireland. The completion of the procurement process is the most effective mechanism to deliver high-speed broadband, rather than possibly leading to its delay or similar. The preferred bidder will be identified by September of this year and the physical roll-out of high-speed broadband will commence in the amber areas following the signing of the contract. Senator Joe O'Reilly raised the worthy ambition to connect all houses, with which all Members agree, and mentioned the sale of Telecom Éireann, as did Senator Coffey and others. In hindsight, the lock, stock and barrel sale of its infrastructure, poles and lines was a retrograde and regrettable decision. The Government has agreed that, with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, it will bring forward legislation to create certainty on infrastructural access and maintenance over the 25 years of the contract. The national broadband plan is not just about delivering for today or next year but, rather, delivering and being future-proofed for up to 25 years because, as we know, technologies change and advance with time. It is important that the contract includes a requirement on future-proofing, and that is part of the reason for the complexity and delay in that regard. We will bring forward proposed legislation intended to apply to all infrastructure owners where infrastructure is required for the delivery of the national broadband plan. Several other Senators made contributions. Senator Coffey raised the issue of the commitment in the national planning framework which is due out on Friday. It is strange to hear commentary on a plan that has not yet been published. A draft plan was published a long time ago but there will be substantial changes to it because there has been substantial engagement in that regard by Senators and Deputies of all parties in recent months. There have been debates in this House on this very important project to be announced on Friday. Senator Mulherin discussed the national broadband strategy, which provided for very basic broadband at the time and is not comparable to the roll-out of high-speed fibre broadband to homes that is now planned in most cases. Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the time of delivery. The plan is for the contract to be signed by September and that roll-out will then begin. Eir will be continuing with the contract to which it has committed, as will other private operators. Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of Eir using the network and negotiations in that regard. This has been going on for a long time. Although SIRO had its own plans in that regard, usage of the Eir network formed part of all discussions that have taken place with Enet-SSE. When there was an initial consultation last September, the closing date of that stage, much information was brought forward by the bidders on their concerns regarding how they envisaged this going ahead. There was much analysis in that regard; the bidders highlighted their red lines and Eir made a decision thereafter. It is important to have full transparency of the process at all times. That has contributed to the delay because we do not want to end up in a situation whereby something is done or a contract is awarded but then has to be nullified or stalled because of an issue with the process. It is very important that everything is above board and that there is due process and transparency.It was not as though we could prevent commercial operators from operating during the recent period while we prepared a map to provide certainty about the areas, houses, farms and premises that need to be connected. Commercial investment was taking place at all stages while we were trying to finalise the map. During that time, Eir came in with the 300,000 houses and premises, which complicated the matter further. That was a commercial decision on the part of the company and the Government then had to make a decision. It signed a commitment contract with the company to ensure Eir stood by its commitment to connect the houses and take them out of the NBP. The Minister had to attend a meeting of the Cabinet committee on infrastructure, where no doubt this issue was discussed. We have had a number of debates on it in the other House. We understand and accept the frustrations of Members, and the importance of broadband for rural Ireland. That is why we are committed to ensuring that the contract is signed under the NBP, that the company carries out what is required of it, that all premises in the State have high-speed broadband as soon as is practicable and that the State invests in the most rural areas to ensure no place is left out and will have the same opportunity as the most urban areas in the country and, indeed, the world have in respect of broadband provision.

There are two amendments here in respect of academic councils, which are variations of one another. I listened to some of the debate at home last week from my sick bed. I turned it off after a while when I realised that watching work from home was making me feel even more unwell. When I watched back, I was really struck by people's lack of understanding around the strength of student representation in universities as it stands. I think it was being mixed up with technological universities.

It was somewhere in the west of Ireland. Institutes of technology do not historically have as positive and as established a student representation as the universities. As they are now going to become part of the university sector, we are trying to put them on the same footing as what currently exists in the college structure. I sat on the governing board and finance board of Trinity College. Our education officer and three student convenors sat on the academic council. It has always been a very positive, welcoming experience. This is about creating the space to allow for the same strength across the technological universities. It has always been quite a positive experience. The Bill as currently worded states that the academic council shall have "such number of students of the technological university as it considers appropriate". I noticed in the Minister of State's comments from the last debate that she said that because there will be student representation on the governing boards which will set the regulations for students on the academic council, the students' voice will be heard and that they will be able to advocate for a given number of students to be on the council. However, on some governing boards there will be as few as one student. If there is ever a vote, they will not have enough power or say to sway it in order to ensure that there is student representation on the academic councils. I will probably not push amendment No. 19 and I will focus on amendment No. 20, which is a very reasonable amendment. It just changes the term "appropriate" to "but not less than 1” so that, at the very least, there is sure to be one student representative on an academic council.

First, there is not enough included about the registrar. A registrar is an academic reference point for ethos and standards and he or she should be a member of the governing authority. I do not think that is in the Bill. There is also no reference to the university secretary being on the governing authority. I agree with Senator Ruane that we are trying to parallel the university system here. It is a very important position because it has legal as well as academic authority. I find it fascinating also that there is no schedule setting out the role of the president. The role of a president in any university is very important because he or she can come from outside. They do not necessarily come from inside the campus. That is extremely important. There is also no reference to the president as Accounting Officer for the university. I also feel that, because this is a Bill on technological universities, there should be more emphasis on teaching. Half of the universities live in their heads and many people in universities do not know how to teach. Teaching is a strength of technological universities and there should be more reference to it in the Bill. There is no schedule about the role of the chairman of the governing authority, and he or she also usually comes from outside. What is the role of the chairman? What are their duties? What is expected of him or her? It is a serious role and he or she has a duty to be informed, to act in accordance with the university ethos and to keep the governing authority in line. In turn, he or she is to be kept in line legally by the secretary. They are huge roles and I would like to see more emphasis on them. These are just general observations. I do not have a problem with the Bill otherwise but these are just my general feelings about it.

That is what we are trying to do. Legislation that is written today may not be questioned for the next 50 years; indeed, it might not be questioned for the next 100 years. On the day it is questioned, however, if it is not clear that there must be at least one student on the academic council, the man or woman with the wig, the judge who will ultimately be the arbitrator of the legislation if it is challenged, will turn around and say that the legislation simply states "as it considers appropriate" and that a board of governors may look at this question and decide that it is inappropriate for there to be a student on the academic council at a given time. That can happen and it is for that reason and that reason alone that we must ensure that at least one student will be on the academic council. It has to happen. Nobody in this room can put hand on heart and say that this will never happen.

The Government does not want the Bill to go back to the Dáil for this reason and, for that reason, I suggest we have a vote on the amendments and draw the matter to a conclusion. I have already given many reasons to show that one possible interpretation is that it is not necessary to have one student. That is quite clear. The English language is absolutely plain on that. That would be a legal interpretation of it. This is an unusual case but it is not impossible to comprehend.

It is not only necessary to have a student representative but a students' union representative. We would not want a student representative to be chosen by the governing body or by a body that is alien to the students' union. Students' unions are constituted by the student body itself. We would be keen that it would be a students' union representative. I also find myself in a similar position to Senator Norris in that I am disappointed at the Government's failure to accept these amendments. We had tabled an amendment about having an Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, representative on the governing body as well and that amendment was ruled out on the spurious ground that it represented a cost to the Exchequer. I support these amendments. We should have a vote. I hope that people in this House will see sense and vote in favour of the amendments.

I could see how disappointed he was in how the Government is dealing with this. Students in the institutes of technology are anxious to see if the Government will listen to the most reasonable of requests. The message coming from the Government is that it does not matter how reasonable the request is because it is just not going to listen. That is the most depressing thing; regardless of what the request is, we have a Government that simply will not listen. That is the message it is sending out to some of the brightest of our young people who are coming through third level education. What a depressing prospect that is. While I hope the Government has a change of mind, I must say I am not optimistic.

I was an adult who had worked in different sectors of society for years and I still felt intimidated by the level of knowledge in the room, the academics in the room, people who had been doing the governance of Trinity for years and knew it inside out. It takes a while to catch up. As a student president on a board like that, I was in a minority, not only in the sense that I was just one person but also that I had years less experience than any of the people in that room. Sometimes something would happen in a meeting before there was even time to catch it. We need to make sure, legally, that institutes of technology have strong representation in these spaces because their student unions are still only developing and are not as strong as those in the rest of the university sector. It is a very intimidating space to be in and we should make sure we protect students in that space by accepting amendment No. 20.

This is an aim I support. We must ensure the provisions of the Bill do not mean that it will amount to a mere rebranding exercise, and these amendments are aimed at ensuring there is no fall off in standards from the existing national norms for education. The worst-case scenario outcome for the Bill would be that it would amount to a huge and expensive rebranding exercise that amalgamated campuses at great cost and for no subsequent benefit increase in quality. Amendment No. 21 seeks to ensure that a large swathe of students - all those from levels 6 to level 8 - are captured by the section, which sets out the calculation of the eligibility criteria for applicant bodies.This would have the effect of dramatically distorting the figures relating to the number of students engaged in what we now consider academic research. In a worst-case scenario, students in taught level 9 programmes could be redesignated with, for example, course work reassigned as part of their thesis, thereby pushing them above the 60% final project compliance as laid out in the Bill. This sleight of hand could mean easy compliance with the 4% figure, without anything close to genuine research work being carried out. Such research work, as we currently understand it, is defined by Quality and Qualifications Ireland as involving numerous essential aspects, including a research strategy, research infrastructure, appropriate supervisory arrangements, capacity and more. It is essential that these standards should not be compromised. Under existing definitions, none of the potential applicants would meet the 4% research requirement. Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, would be closest at 4.2%. However, with level 6, 7 and 8 students removed from consideration, all but Galway-Mayo IT leap well past it. Is it seriously being proposed that the current level of research in the existing institutions is more than adequate and that this is the level of research we would hold them to as technological universities? Research is at the core of all true academia - the generation of new knowledge and innovation, the sparking of new thoughts and the development of new ideas. I hope the Minister of State will accept that the current wording in the Bill would set the bar far too low in this regard. Along the same lines, amendment No. 23 seeks to pursue the same principle with regard to the academic staff who make up the teaching staff at the technological universities in the future. The current level of those with a PhD in third-level teaching staff in our universities is 81%. Considering the development and increased standards in academia in Ireland and the world over the past few decades, it would be unlikely for a new university hire to have attained such a level nowadays. However, stipulations in the legislation would again allow for a massaging of the figures. Under the existing definition in section 28(1)(c), all institutes of technology are comfortably in excess of the target of 45% with PhD or equivalent. By artificially suppressing the number of lecturers included for the purposes of the assessment, only a tiny number of the total staff would be included, virtually guaranteeing automatic compliance with an artificially low number. These issues matter because standards in our colleges and universities matter. I implore the Minister of State to think about the effect that such a low bar would have, not only on the operation of the technological universities but also on their long-term viability as respected institutions.

She is an absolute star of the silent screen. The phrase "to an award to at least" is used in section 28(1)(a)(i). The second "to" is redundant; it should be "of". The phrase "at least 4 per cent are research students registered on a programme" is also used. This should be amended to "registered on a research programme" because without the second "research", it could be a programme of any kind. I am concerned about these matters and I have tabled amendments for Report Stage.

The criteria relate to the composition of the student body, academic staff and PhD and research activity, as well as the ability of an institution to perform in terms of governance, quality assurance and collaboration with regional stakeholders. I share the concerns of colleagues, which are outlined in Senator Grace O'Sullivan's amendment. I have been around long enough to remember the upgrading of regional technical colleges, RTCs, to institutes of technology in the 1980s and 1990s. I make no apologies for being parochial because at the time Waterford RTC had advanced to a stage where it was one of the leading institutes at the time and there was a recognition that it should, on merit, be elevated to institute of technology status. However, many of the other RTCs were upgraded at the same time and this lessened the elevated standard that Waterford RTC had achieved on merit. I am concerned that something similar is happening again. In 2012, the Hunt report set out criteria that have since been amended. The criteria rightly set a high bar for any institute of technology to achieve the status of technological university. We often read about the ranking of Irish universities globally and sometimes concerns are expressed that they are slipping down the rankings. To have substance behind various degree courses, we need to have confidence in the institutes issuing them. Are we just responding to the demands of the time to have all institutes of technology upgraded to technological universities? They should only be elevated on merit. I do not say that to be disrespectful to any institute of technology. According to HEA data, DIT is streets ahead, with 448 level 10 PhD students. The next highest is WIT, with 148, while CIT has 116; IT Sligo, 35; GMIT, 26; and Carlow IT, 9. These figures demonstrate where strong research is being done in colleges. DIT is progressing strongly towards university status. However, WIT is next and that is why the argument has been made for years that it merits university status. While I am supportive of the legislation, I share the concerns regarding standards in the context of the eligibility criteria. Why have the criteria been amended from those set out in the original plan in 2012? Six years later, they have been diluted. If institutes of technology merge and go through the process, all of them will achieve technological university status. If I am wrong, I will stand corrected. This again suggests that we are just responding to a political demand or lobby to the effect that all institutes of technology should be elevated.However, that takes away from the merit of, and the work that has been put in by, institutes that have expanded their courses and student bases and that have elevated all of their academic staff by supporting them to achieve higher levels of lecturing. I am concerned about this and I hope the Minister of State can address this concern. We do not want a name change or for every institution to be granted university status just because they achieve what I believe to be a reduced standard. We need a robust threshold so that we can have confidence in the level of achievement. I hope that the Minister of State can respond to my concerns in this regard. The proposers of the amendments have made their arguments very well. Senator Norris and others have said that there is a place for technical colleges, for institutes of technology and for technological universities. They need to be clearly differentiated however. They need to be differentiated by quality of education, by the number of PhDs and by the research carried out in those institutes. We cannot have them all on the same pitch if they do not have the same levels of achievement. I am voicing my concern in that regard to the Minister of State.

I assure the Senator that we are not lowering the bar. This will be a step-change in education and in institutes of higher education right across the country. That is what we want. The criteria are based on the original criteria set out in the Higher Education Authority's document, Towards a Future Higher Education Landscape. They present a realistic and ambitious set of targets for applicant institutes seeking to achieve technological university status. They protect the commitment to level 6 and level 7 programmes and the securing of the necessary talent pipeline supply at those relevant skill levels. However, they set the bar for higher level programme participation at challenging, though attainable and progressive, targets. The application process requires the demonstration of compliance with the eligibility criteria for technological university designation. The current criteria are supported by the Higher Education Authority and the Technological Higher Education Association and they are considered appropriate as key elements for establishing technological university designation in the Irish context. Moreover, to seek to introduce additional requirements into the criteria now, when consortia have been working long and hard to attain long-set criteria would be a significant change of direction which would likely delay the process of technological university development. They have also set the bar for staff development and qualifications. The consortia have undertaken considerable work to ensure compliance with these criteria. It would not be helpful at this stage to change the criteria to those proposed in these amendments. The criteria were arrived at through a process of consultation and discussion. They represent a challenge for the applicants, but one that is attainable. I do not support a change of the type proposed in these amendments. It is also very important to say that all eligibility criteria will be assessed by an expert advisory panel which will include international experts. That is going to happen.  I have every confidence in some of the consortia that have moved considerably along the road, for example, the TU4 Dublin group. I have every confidence that these consortia will succeed but they have to make sure that their eligibility criteria are assessed. Some of the other technological university applicant groups have gone some of the way but are not quite there yet. I heard one comment that every institute of technology will be able to join a consortium and become a technological university. That is not the case. They will have to go through an eligibility process.

On the element of standards, it has been brought to my attention that a new definition of research students has been introduced since the original proposal. That new definition changes the ability of IOTs to qualify. The change to the definition of research students means that more IOTs will achieve technological university status. There was also a change in respect of excluding the body of staff from the requirement for 45% of staff to hold PhDs. Those changes jointly amount to lower qualification criteria in themselves. These are the concerns which are being expressed to me. I am taking the opportunity to be parochial because there has been a campaign in Waterford for a university for the region for 20 or 30 years now. It is not based on pipe dreams or false ambitions. It is based on hard work, graft and ability to deliver in terms of the staff of the institute over those years and the students who have graduated from it. The students are of the highest standard and I want to acknowledge that. Without disrespect to the other institutes, we need to reward that perseverance and that ability to deliver in terms of educational attainment from the top of the spectrum right to the bottom.  Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, already meets the criteria that have been set because it has the numbers in respect of its academic staff and it has the student numbers carrying out the levels of research. If it is the case, and it is, that we genuinely want to advance technological universities, based on the existing numbers that Waterford Institute of Technology has, it should be allowed go alone. It is not right for a Government Senator to be saying that but I am speaking based on the facts that I see, the evidence that is before me and what I have learned over many years with regard to Waterford Institute of Technology. The figures in the HEA data tell me that WIT already reaches those standards in terms of academia, research students and so on. I want to put my concern on the record that there is more or less a forced marriage in respect of WIT. It is being forced to amalgamate when the institute already achieves the standards.

It does not reward WIT for the work that it has done. It is forcing an amalgamation. If it happens and if it will be to the benefit of the region I will support it because the region does need a university but, as the legislation is being brought forward, I am putting it on the record that Waterford Institute of Technology already attains the standards.As evidence of the suspicions I have had in this regard for many years, I would mention that when it was decided in the late 1990s to elevate the then Waterford Regional Technical College to institute of technology status, all the other regional technical colleges around the country were subsequently elevated to institute of technology status as well. I believe this took from the merit and the benefit of the college at that time. I am afraid this will happen again. I think it is the wrong way to advance. We have to differentiate. Even in primary school, education deals with differentiation. I think we should do it at third level as well. We should reward attainment and high standards. I know the Bill means to do that. We should not be bringing everybody up for the sake of it. We should not be forcing amalgamations for the sake of them.

We have gone a long way on this road now. We have been talking about technological universities for many years. I believe the proposal was withdrawn in 2015. We went back to the drawing board. Since then, we have consulted all the various stakeholders. I have had heard the same message I have heard from Senator Coffey from Senator McFadden in respect of Athlone Institute of Technology. She wants to know why it cannot establish itself as a technological university. First of all, we need a critical mass to make sure standards are high with that critical mass. I do not have the exact numbers in front of me. For example, University College Dublin probably has approximately 20,000 students. The Dublin technological university will have approximately 28,000 students. The Munster technological university, which will comprise Cork and Kerry institutes of technology, will have 14,000 students.

There will now be a university offering in Waterford, Carlow and Wexford, all joined as a consortium. Students will be able to choose whether they want to go to a university in their own region. The last time we debated this issue, Senator Coffey pointed out strongly that many students never come back. That was pointed out to me strongly when I served as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. That message was loud and clear when I had the great pleasure of going to Waterford to open new companies there. Standards will be maintained and will improve. We will have more students. The consortium will have approximately 14,500 students. There will be a competing offering for students to continue on and do their master's degrees and, if they so wish and they attain the requisite standards, to go on and do their PhDs. Quite honestly, we have moved on. I know Waterford Institute of Technology is very good. I am certainly not taking from it or from the Institute of Technology, Carlow. I am not going to be a judge, like Solomon, deciding between them here. We have gone along the road. We have done all the consultation with the different stakeholders. I believe we have a number of consortiums that are going to apply for technological university status in the coming months. When they do so, they will have to prove their eligibility. It is not a given. They will have to show they come up to the standards. I assure the House that I want high standards. I want our students to be able to stand on the international stage, or our national stage, and be able to get jobs that are just as good as the jobs of their international peers.

As many institutes of technology have a strong commitment to providing pathways to students from non-traditional learning backgrounds, they have given many students an opportunity to study at third level that would otherwise not have been open to them. This amendment seeks to protect this tradition. I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say on this issue.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-13 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	274	The reference in this amendment to "NQF level 5" relates to honours leaving certificate qualifications as well as other types of further education qualifications. One would expect many of the students who are coming into an institute of technology to have leaving certificate qualifications. Therefore, they would be at the NQF stage referred to in the amendment. This amendment may have been tabled in search of reassurance that students at lower levels of qualification are adequately represented. Section 9(1) of this Bill specifically requires technological universities to "provide teaching and facilitate learning that ... promotes excellence at all levels of higher education" within the NQF. Furthermore, it requires technological universities to "provide programmes of education and training that reflect the needs of individuals" and to "provide for the broad education, intellectual and personal development of students". Equity of access to higher education is a fundamental principle of Irish education policy. The higher education system performance framework is the key instrument for overseeing progress against goals, objectives and targets in the national access plan and broader access strategies.The new system performance framework is in place for the period from 2018 to 2020. These key objectives are set out by the Government and will form the basis for the next iteration of strategic dialogue on access between the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the higher education institutions. Among the key targets for the 2018-20 framework is sustaining the expansion of under-represented groups, with 2,000 additional enrolments from socio-economically disadvantaged groups and 1,000 enrolments from further education access programmes. It would not be advisable to provide for specific targets in primary legislation, as an ongoing review of progress is vital to enable the widest possible flexibility, ensuring the greatest range of pathways into higher education. Therefore I will not be accepting the amendment.

The Athena SWAN award sets the standard for gender equality in third-level institutions, and it has been very encouraging to see so many universities and institutions around Ireland put mechanisms and strategies to earn this award in place. However, no institute of technology, IT, has yet been awarded an Athena SWAN award at any level, although some have initiated the process. This is an area that should be made a priority in the establishment of the universities, especially because funding will soon become contingent on achieving at least a silver award. It seems only logical that it is given statutory footing in this Bill. I know the Minister of State's commitment to gender equality in education, and I hope she can accept this amendment. I think this is an exceptionally important amendment, considering that some universities have applied several times for the Athena SWAN and have been refused it. They have been working on their implementation processes for many years and have not been able to reach that standard. If university funding or a part thereof is to become contingent on achieving that Athena SWAN award, I note the institutes of technology will be coming in to that process very late. This amendment is about how they can have the capacity and resources to be able to achieve the required standard in gender equality.

I hope to see that happen very soon. I note, however, that there are women presidents of institutes of technology. However, I do not just want to see presidents, I want to see women achieving professorships. The figures I have indicate that approximately 19% of professorships in Ireland are held by women. That means that of every 100 employees in senior lectureships with whom female students interact, they will see 81 men and only 19 women in such senior levels in third level institutions. This is despite the fact that the majority of students going to universities and institutes of technology now are young women. This is a very bad context for those young women to see when they get into the higher education institutes.  There are several provisions relating to gender equality in the Bill. Section 9(1)(q) of the Bill, states that one of the functions of a technological university shall be to "promote the attainment of gender balance and equality of opportunity among the students and staff of the technological university". Section 12(5)(b) also provides that in making regulations relating to conduct of elections, seeking of nominations for appointment and appointment of members to the governing body, the technological university "shall have regard to the objective that at least 40 per cent of members of the governing body shall be women and at least 40 per cent shall be men". I also accepted an amendment from Deputy Thomas Byrne on Committee Stage in the Dáil that addresses the gender balance issue for academic councils. It now provides that at least 40% of the academic council of a technological university shall be women and at least 40% shall be men. Furthermore, section 19 of the Bill provides for the preparation by a technological university of equality statements. These will specify its policies on the promotion of access and equality, including gender equality, in all activities of the technological university. On 6 November I announced the establishment of the gender equality task force, which I have just referenced. This high-level task force will prepare a prioritised three-year action plan in consultation with stakeholders. This has been provided for in the Action Plan for Education. The task force will also oversee a national systems review of the policies and practices pertaining to recruitment and promotion that currently are in place in higher education institutions with a view to identifying good practice and highlighting areas that need improvement. This will feed into the development of actions for the action plan. The task force will build on work that was done by the HEA's national review on gender equality in Irish higher education, which was published in 2016. That report provided important analysis of the progress towards gender equality in Irish higher education institutions and made recommendations. The task force will now identify good practices in the higher education sector, including in those institutions that have been awarded Athena SWAN awards. It will also derive lessons from the experience of those institutions that have not been successful with the Athena SWAN application.Although all universities and ITs are signed up to the charter, I do not view the attainment of particular awards-based standards as necessarily appropriate for inclusion in legislation of this nature. I just do not see putting one specific award into legislation as the right way to go. I believe it is too prescriptive. We are talking about Athena SWAN silver. There is a higher award.

In May 2015, the charter was expanded to recognise work undertaken in arts, humanities, social sciences, business and law, professional and support roles and for trans staff and students. The charter now recognises work undertaken to address gender equality more broadly and not just barriers to progression that affect women. That was just a little bit of research conducted on behalf of Senator Norris and his colleagues.

As colleagues will be aware, the new EU data protection directive, the GDPR, will take effect from May this year and will impact on all public and private bodies. It is important that this issue be given priority in the establishment of the technological universities and I think the provision would be a strong addition to the Bill.

The GDPR will come into force on 25 May 2018. It replaces the existing data protection framework under the EU data protection directive. Article 24 of the GDPR requires controllers, that is, the higher education institutions, to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing of personal data is performed in accordance with the GDPR. The GDPR provides by law for greater accountability, transparency and security in respect of processing personal data. The Minister for Justice and Equality is currently progressing the Data Protection Bill 2017 and this Bill will provide for the implementation of new EU data protection rules which will come into force in May 2018. These rules will apply to all organisations, public and private, large and small. The present Bill is not the requisite legislative vehicle, in my view, to seek to oversee compliance with such legislation. Therefore, I do not accept this amendment.

It states: ""research student” means a student who is registered on a programme of education and training where not less than 60 per cent of the available credits are assigned in respect of a thesis or theses prepared by the student based on research conducted by him or her". I want to delete and substitute as follows: "a student registered on a programme of education leading to a research award as determined by the procedures established under the Act of 2012." In other words, the definition should be looking towards a research award, which is the end point. The definition currently proposed is entirely at odds with recognised definitions of a research student and would be contrary to what is currently accepted by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI. There is a very strong argument for making this change and I will be proposing an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.

An expert panel of evaluators should be using the criteria as a backbone to their assessment, which should certainly go beyond a mere checklist of certifying criteria if the technological universities are to be the higher education centres of excellence that the Minister has envisaged.

The amendment seeks to add to the requirement on applicant institutions such that as well as showing compliance with the eligibility criteria set out in section 29, an applicant institution would also demonstrate that it meets the standard required for university designation. These standards are not defined. However, we have defined the eligibility criteria and the consortia have been working on them. To add at this stage an abstract concept such as "the standards required for university designation" would bring a note of uncertainty and an element of subjectivity as to what such a standard is. What we have put into the Bill is eligibility for technological universities.

There would be an additional possibility to have more options available in terms of setting the bar. It is all about excellence and creating a bar to which one wants to aspire and not setting a criteria level at this stage without that option to develop upwards and onwards.

If we go back to pages 28 to 30, inclusive, and most of page 31, they set out the bar as the Senator describes it. We are calling this bar "eligibility criteria". This includes a requirement to demonstrate compliance with the eligibility criteria. They are in the pages I have just named. Section 28 sets out in detail the eligibility criteria and makes it clear to the applicant institutes and any other assessment panel what criteria must be applied and measured in assessing the application. I would have concerns that the introduction now of an additional standard, not defined in the legislation, would introduce a degree of uncertainty and subjectivity. Section 30(a) is expressed in clear and precise terms. The wording used was drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government following consultation with the Department. Those are the reasons I am not accepting the amendment.
