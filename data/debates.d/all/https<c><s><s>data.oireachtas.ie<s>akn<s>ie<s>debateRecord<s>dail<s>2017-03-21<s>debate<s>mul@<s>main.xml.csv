#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	I start by offering the sincere sympathies of my party and my leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, on the death of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick of the Irish Coast Guard who was buried at the weekend. We also extend our thoughts and prayers to the families of the missing crewmen of Rescue 116, Captain Mark Duffy, and winch crew, Paul Ormsby and Ciarán Smith, at this incredibly difficult time for their families and friends. In a moment, we will have an opportunity to convey our sympathies on the untimely passing of the late Martin McGuinness, the former deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland. I will say a few words on that in due course. I acknowledge also the passing of Maureen Haughey, wife of the late Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, mother of our colleague, Deputy Seán Haughey, and daughter of former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass. We also acknowledge and extend our sympathies on the tragic death of the young Derry City footballer, Ryan McBride, over the weekend. Given that Prime Minister Theresa May announced that she will formally pull the trigger on Article 50 in eight days' time, 29 March, the realities and challenges that Brexit poses on the island of Ireland are now becoming all too real. This trigger means that Brexit will have to take place by March 2019 unless the UK and the remaining 27 member states of the European Union agree to extend the exit talks. As a country, we need to have a number of clear and key priorities in the negotiations, namely, protection of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK; protecting the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement that underpins it and ensuring there is no hard border of any sort on the island of Ireland; and protecting the enormously important trading relationship we have with the UK. The Taoiseach does not need to be reminded of the importance of that trading relationship, with around 14% of all Irish exports going to the UK, but for many indigenous Irish firms, in particular manufacturing firms and those involved in agrifood, for example, the dependence is far greater. The one thing we must avoid is the cliff effect of the UK falling out of the European Union in two years' time with no interim deal agreed on trade arrangements. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, alluded to that in recent days. Is it the negotiating position of the Government that there would be an interim deal on how trade between Ireland and the UK and with the remainder of the European Union will be conducted post-Brexit and in advance of any long-term deal on the overall trading arrangement between Ireland, the EU and the UK? We now have an overall timeline.We know Mr. Donald Tusk has confirmed there will be a meeting of the European Council on 29 April. We also know the European Union General Affairs Council will meet some time in mid-May to adopt formal negotiating directives, with talks now finally getting under way perhaps in late May or early June. The country now deserves to know if Deputy Enda Kenny will be the Taoiseach attending the European Council summit on 29 April. Will he be the Taoiseach in office when the General Affairs Council holds its meeting in mid-May? Will he be the captain of the ship, as such, when these critical negotiations for the future of our country get under way in late May or early June? We deserve clarity on that aspect.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	I welcome the comments by Deputy Michael McGrath in respect of the efforts being made to complete the recovery of Rescue 116. I was down there yesterday and there was a very heavy swell. There is great co-ordination and communication between all the agencies under the direction of the coastguard. It is very professional and I hope the window with the weather will arise this week so they can make the recovery of the crew members, black boxes and the wreckage in order to determine what happened in this tragedy. I was not in a position to attend the funeral of the late Mrs. Haughey this morning. I met her on a number of occasions over the years and I sent my aide-de-camp to represent my office as I was in attendance at Cabinet. We will have an opportunity for short statements in respect of the death of Mr. Martin McGuinness, a peacemaker, now departed. I concur with the Deputy's comments on the death of the young captain of the Derry City team and others mentioned. In addition to the points raised by Deputy Michael McGrath, it is clear our priorities are the common travel area, the protection of the peace process, the non-return to a hard Border and the maintenance of the trading relationship between Ireland and the UK. More important to all our futures is the position of Ireland as a member of the European Union. We will continue to negotiate and participate as a member of those 27 member states. The timescale has been set out and greater clarity is now being brought to the issue with the announcement by the British Prime Minister on the triggering of Article 50. The European Council will respond to this and Ireland is being asked, along with other countries, to put forward its view in respect of the draft negotiations. They will be on the lines I have mentioned. I do not attend General Affairs Council meetings but I expect to attend the European Council meeting on 29 April and have set out the grounds that we consider really critical in terms of the negotiations to be conducted, which will last for quite a while. It is my view that a transition period must be involved in terms of the trading relationships that will apply. The British Government wants as close a relationship as possible with the European Union and I support that principle. It is how one has that relationship, having been removed from the Single Market and changed position with regard to the customs union, that will be the net point of the negotiations.

That would be devastating for many thousands of Irish businesses and potentially many thousands of jobs in the country. That must be acknowledged. The Taoiseach has made it clear he intends to remain in his position to attend the European Council meeting on 29 April. The man sitting next to him, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, yesterday called on the Taoiseach to be in that position when the negotiations get under way in early June.One of the main contenders for the Taoiseach's position, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has said he expects the Taoiseach to set out shortly a process for the election of a new leader of the Fine Gael Party. We need to know who will be in charge when these negotiations get under way. It is not a laughing matter. With all due respect, the Taoiseach once famously said, "Paddy likes to know".

The Taoiseach has personally taken on overall responsibility for Brexit for managing the process and leading the negotiations on Ireland's behalf. Who will be in charge when Ireland enters these negotiations in late May and early June? The people deserve a straight answer.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	10	I want to share in the expressions of sympathy with Captain Dara Fitzpatrick's family and, indeed, with the families of the missing crew of Rescue 116, and acknowledge the passing of Mrs. Maureen Haughey and the loss of young Ryan McBride of Derry City. Today, I stand here in place of my party leader, Deputy Adams, who spent the night in Derry with the family of our departed friend and comrade, Martin McGuinness. I stand here with a mixture of great pride but also sorrow. I want to place on the record my condolences and those of Sinn Féin to Bernie, Emmet, Fionnuala, Gráinne and Fiachra, to their grandchildren and the extended McGuinness family. They have lost a husband, a brother, a father, a grandfather and a friend. I want to acknowledge the kind words of President Higgins, those kind words from the Taoiseach, and, indeed, from others in this House. There is no doubt that we have lost a great leader of Irish republicanism. Martin inspired a generation. He showed a generation that achieving real political change is possible. He was a man who stood up to injustice, who fought injustice, and was a man who promoted peace and reconciliation. Martin McGuinness, by any measure, made a huge difference. The constant in Martin's life was Irish republicanism. He had a genuine and heartfelt desire for equality and for Irish unity and he worked on this goal until his dying day. That is the core to understanding his political activism, his leadership and, indeed, his life. Martin always conducted himself with integrity and with humility. As the House will be aware, he was my party's chief negotiator in the Good Friday and other agreements, agreements that promised that equality would be the basis for progress and the basis for a peaceful pathway to Irish unity. He acted as education Minister and then as deputy First Minister and he wished to see those agreements fully implemented. As the House will be aware, he extended the hand of friendship to political opponents and demonstrated a real respect for everybody in society. He was a patriot and a dedicated peacemaker, a respected statesman. Martin was a leader of immense stature and when, as happened recently, the agreements which he fought for and stood by were undermined, when confidence in the political institutions was eroded, he acted. In the words of our colleague, Michelle O'Neill, "When something is broken, you stop and you fix it". It was the desire of Martin to see the institutions in the North up and working. He wanted to see our hard-won agreements implemented and to have equality, respect and integrity restored to the political process. That is the work that we all have ahead of us. I believe these are shared objectives for everybody in this Dáil. Today, I want to ask the Taoiseach if he can commit to redouble the efforts of his Government to see the full and speedy implementation of all aspects of those agreements.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	11	Ba mhaith liomsa ar dtús comhbhrón a dhéanamh lena bhean chéile, Bernie, agus a chlann, na gasúir, Emmet, Fionnuala, Gráinne agus Fiachra, as ucht bás a fir chéile agus a n-athar. Martin McGuinness became a peacemaker and travelled the road from terror to truce and through peace to government. The high office he held as deputy First Minister with three First Ministers was put together, in part, by this State on foot of its co-guarantorship of the Good Friday Agreement. He was a person who lived by his convictions and in my dealings with him as a politician on the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and in many other arenas, he was always generous and courteous but committed fully to the democratic way of achieving peace. He articulated that on many occasions. When I encountered Martin McGuinness abroad, we were very happy to provide him and the Northern Ireland Office with the facilities of our State in terms of diplomatic connections and invitations to meet with potential investors for the island of Ireland. He was always happy to raise the issues, of which there were many, with the governments of the day here, in Britain and at European level. The answer to Deputy McDonald's question is "Yes". The Good Friday Agreement was established and voted on North and South by the people, who were overwhelmingly in support of it. It was enshrined as a legally-binding international Agreement backed by Europe, the United States of American and both Governments and it was lodged with the United Nations. There are issues, as Deputy McDonald is well aware, which have not been dealt with. I have a particular interest in the question of legacy issues, of which there are many. I would like to think that following through from the Fresh Start Agreement we can all redouble our efforts in the interests of everyone from all sides of the communities to deal with these issues which should be and can be dealt with.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	12	I thank the Taoiseach for those kind words. We are all very well aware of the outstanding issues that must be resolved. Let it be noted that they are old issues. These are matters that were identified, discussed, negotiated and agreed many years ago but still we await their implementation. That is what this comes down to. I am aware that the Government, not least in the person of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has been involved in the discussions so far. However, I put it to the Taoiseach that we need to intensify efforts now. It is either that or we tread water. When it comes to making peace, advancing the peace process and making progress across Ireland, treading water is not an option. What will the Taoiseach do now to intensify the efforts to arrive at agreement? What engagement will he have with the British Government? I note the Taoiseach's comment that direct rule is not an option, which we very much welcome. Can he reassure us that this remains the position of the Government and that it will be articulated, iterated and reiterated, if necessary, to Theresa May and her Tory Government?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	13	The first priority is for the politicians who have been elected to the Assembly to accept their responsibilities and put together a functioning Executive within the three-week period from the date of the election. There is a set period for that now. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has gone to the North again and has had conversations this morning with Secretary of State Brokenshire. It depends on the two major parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin. A functioning Executive is one with an agreed set of objectives, principles and propositions to put forward. When Prime Minister May met the devolved assemblies in Cardiff recently, she was given a presentation by First Minister Jones from Wales and First Minister Sturgeon from Scotland but there was no presentation from Northern Ireland because there is no agreement and no leadership.The election is over and the result is very clear and the Deputy's party has made substantial gains. It now has a responsibility to work with the major party or parties to put together an Executive that functions. The Executive must be able to set out what it wants for Northern Ireland and what the agreed objectives can be.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	14	The Governments need to fulfil their commitments too, I am sure.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	15	While the late Martin McGuinness had differences of opinion with former First Minister Foster, they set out an agreed set of principles and objectives which were sent to Prime Minister May last year. The Sinn Féin Party now needs to measure up to what Martin McGuinness did and put aside differences in the greater interests of the peoples of Northern Ireland in respect of the objectives they wish to pursue. For my part, I will be very happy as head of Government with our Ministers to work with the British Government and the Prime Minister in the interest of pursuing the many outstanding issues since the Good Friday Agreement was put in place in 1998. The immediate priority and the responsibility of the elected politicians in Northern Ireland is to put together a functional Executive. Otherwise we are trying to speak for them from this distance or from other locations. It would be much more preferable if we had an agreed position, stating it as our proposition, and while there will be differences of opinion this does not prevent doing what Martin McGuinness did in the greater interest of peace and harmony in the communities in the North.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	16	I send my sympathy and condolences and those of the Labour Party to the family of the late Captain Dara Fitzpatrick and the crew of Rescue 116, and wish Godspeed to all those engaged now in the important work of recovery for those families. I also send my condolences and those of my party to the family of Derry City captain, Ryan McBride. We will have an opportunity later to have a fuller offering of condolences to the Sinn Féin Party and the family of the late Martin McGuinness. The Government is pressing ahead with its plans to sell off 25% of AIB. This has been planned despite the fact the proceeds cannot be invested in Irish infrastructure that is so needed. All of us in the House and the people of the country are acutely aware of what it cost the Irish taxpayers and people to bail out our banks. It was always understood and expected we would get back a significant portion of it. We need now to think and plan strategically when it comes to deploying funds which might become available to the State. For many months I have been making the case for changes to the Stability and Growth Pact to allow for greater investment in public infrastructure. I have been advancing this work with my colleagues in the Party of European Socialists and that work is now being adopted by them. I have also repeatedly raised the matter in the Chamber hoping the Taoiseach would do likewise. Unfortunately, he has not provided a response to date that would indicate he would also push for a shift at European level on this matter. The result is that right now none of the proceeds of the sale of AIB can be invested in building the houses, hospitals and schools which we so urgently need. The policy of selling off our holding in AIB was based on the urgent need to reduce our debt but that situation has dramatically changed since the previous Government made that decision. Net debt had already decreased to 66% of GDP prior to the most recent CSO published data and it will fall further. Diverting everything we get from the sale of AIB would have an impact of approximately 1.5% on debt, a small impact. The social good it would yield if we deployed it to meet our infrastructure deficits would be infinitely greater. IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have pressed for greater investment. The social case for housing and hospitals, as I have already said, is crystal clear, and the economic case for investment in transport and communications is equally so, amplified by having Brexit on the horizon. Will the Taoiseach clarify what efforts he has made to secure changes in the Stability and Growth Pact rules to allow us make the urgent investment we now need in our vital infrastructure, particularly having regard to Brexit?Will the Taoiseach clarify whether he intends to press ahead with the sale even if the proceeds of the sale cannot be used for infrastructural investment?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	17	I thank the Deputy for his comments on the rescue of Rescue 116 and those who lost their lives. With regard to the other issue he raised, this is a financial transaction. The paper asset shares are being swapped for a cash injection. That will go towards debt reduction, as the Minister for Finance has made clear. It is also a test of the overall examination of value of AIB. The Government is looking at alternative ways of raising other funding. One of those follows the opening of the European Investment Bank office here in Dublin, which has potential for serious lending of long term, low-interest credit for infrastructure facilities, where a stream of income would be available to repay those loans, whether from tolled motorways, developments of ports or areas of transport like light rail, such as metros or the Luas. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is now conducting a review of the capital programme in partnership with that. The Government allocated almost €5 billion to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to provide houses across a range of areas and this has been backed up by a suite of changes that have been made by the Government to incentivise both local authorities and housing agencies and provide new impetus for availability of sites and so on. I hope that those three aspects - the review of the capital programme, the opportunity that is now being explored through the European Investment Bank and the capacity for further lending into the system - will bring forward new opportunities for investment here. The Minister has said that, based on the advice he has received, an initial public offering, IPO, is the best route to recoup the State's investment in AIB and the key objective is to maximise the proceeds that we can recover over time. The State invested €20.8 billion in AIB through a range of instruments during the financial crisis. It has since recovered €6.6 billion through capital repayments, interest income and fees, and still owns about 99.9% of the ordinary share capital. The primary objective of the Minister and of the Government is to recover all of this investment from AIB. We believe that this is a realistic objective over the medium to long term. There are no changes in the Stability and Growth Pact rules here. It is a transfer of these paper shares for cash, which will go towards debt reduction.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	18	The Taoiseach mentioned European Investment Bank money. The Taoiseach knows that the issue is not access to money. Money is cheap and accessible to this country. It is the ability under the Stability and Growth Pact rules to spend it which is the issue. I asked if the Taoiseach has done anything to alter the rules to allow the vital infrastructure spend that we need to be made. We have seen financial advisers working on the sale of AIB stand to gain some €40 million from this action over the past couple of weeks. No such benefit will accrue to the taxpayer. We need to see the money that becomes available used for the productive capacity of the State to meet the real infrastructure deficits that we need to meet if we are going to face up to Brexit. That is not a view that I only hold. Last week, The
Sunday Times reported that Deputy Michael McGrath had similar concerns while Deputy Pearse Doherty is opposed to the sale. Will the Taoiseach bring proposals to the floor of the House before any further progress is made on this matter since there seems to be a majority in it opposed to the action proposed by Government?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	19	The Minister has already pointed out that there are two potential windows for the disposal of the sale this year, either May or June or some time in the autumn. The Government is fortunately not under any particular pressure to sell so the market conditions will impact on when the Minister decides to make his recommendation to Government to sell. The sale of the bank shares would not result in a beneficial impact to the general Government balance as it would not be counted as revenue, as Deputy Howlin is aware.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	20	That is the very point I am making.

The proceeds from any IPO would be used to pay down debt. As I pointed out to the Deputy earlier, it is possible to spend substantial moneys off balance sheet provided an income stream can be identified from, for example, investment from the European Investment Bank.

It is open for business and one of those businesses is to identify streams of income that would have a capacity to repay long-term loans such as, for example, tolled motorways, the development of ports, or provision where there are streams of income from the Luas, metro or light-rail systems. That matter is being actively explored by the Department of Finance with the European Investment Bank.

I want to return to Thursday, 16 February, when the Taoiseach and a number of Ministers, officials and the media came to a hall in the north inner city to launch the report compiled by Mr. Kieran Mulvey. The immediate impetus for the report was a number of murders, some of which happened in the area, but all of them relating to the area. However, there was a much longer lead-in to what was actually happening. That came about because of the neglect and indifference of many Governments to the area and to the issues there. It also came from budget cuts, as well as financial and economic policies, that adversely and disproportionately affected that area. This was especially the case for community and voluntary organisations, schools and gardaí. In addition, it concerned the way in which drugs were allowed to take hold and devastate individuals and communities. Policies to deal with that were not matched with the necessary resources to implement them. The report acknowledged all of that, including the neglect, dereliction, crime, open drug dealing and poor housing. The report also acknowledged the area's potential and the community's solidarity. There was extensive community engagement whose driving force was the North Inner City Community Coalition. That coalition organised groups, families and individuals to come together in a number of working parties to deal with education, arts and culture, drugs, crime and sports as they affect young people. The coalition made a substantial submission and although hopes were high, the report fell short of expectations. The report was strong on what needs to be done but less so on how and when. Ironically, there was no mention of drugs, and other key areas were also left out. As outlined in a letter to the Taoiseach, the coalition confirmed its commitment to the process but it has to bring about fundamental change. For that to happen, it needs a coherent, integrated, radical and innovative approach, and not the same talk and false promises. The voice of the community has to be heard and their concerns relate to community involvement at all levels. The ten-member board has only one community representative so that must be addressed. Following his own personal engagement there, the Taoiseach knows the wealth of experience, insight and knowledge of the people from the community. There are concerns about the timeframe for implementing the process so when will it start? There are also concerns about funding, which must be open and transparent. Committed funding should be additional, rather than money that has already been earmarked for the area. There are also questions about the independent chair, the role of Dublin City Council, and the need for a long-term commitment regardless of who is in government. The danger is that when the meetings and consultations are over, the report will be left to gather dust. The Taoiseach indicated that he would meet the convenors. He should, therefore, name a date as soon as possible so that those areas can be addressed. That would mean that the report will have a chance to be acted upon.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	27	I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for her contributions to the overall report during the course of many discussions we had in the north inner city and here at Government Buildings. She is aware that the report presented by Mr. Kieran Mulvey is both comprehensive and inclusive. It was produced as a consequence of a great deal of discussions that took place in the north inner city. On foot of the report, quite a number of smaller projects have already commenced or are in the process of being completed.It is also a fact that an office is to be opened in the north inner city to deal with transparency and accessibility and to be a constant reminder of the reasons why this was set up in the first place. This will also be monitored from my Department, in the same way as the action plan for jobs and such like, where reports are produced every three months so that people can see the progress being made. Rather than give the Deputy a date for such a meeting now, I will report to the House on the basis of that office being set up, the system in respect of monitoring from my Department and the independent person being appointed to work together with Dublin City Council, without whose assistance this could not have been done and for which we are very grateful. I will then advise the Deputy of an appropriate date for meeting.  I take the Deputy's point about community involvement. There are some powerful leader personalities in the north inner city. They are all focused on doing the very best for their communities and the general area. That is why it is important that the report is not just left lying there but that it is implemented in a transparent, accountable way so that the people can see the opportunities and facilities being provided. As one young man said on the presentation of the report, one's background or the location where one was born should never be an obstacle or a prohibition to getting a job. Is that not what this is about? I again thank the Deputy for her contribution.

Otherwise, it will be the statutory players who will be giving their decisions about an area when it is the community voice that knows exactly what needs to happen there. This is not just about the north inner city, it can be a template and a framework for other areas, in Dublin and outside it, that are facing similar issues. I have two final points. We know how important jobs are yet the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is not a member of the ministerial task force. At this moment, An Bord Pleanála is hearing an application for planning permission in regard to the Clerys site. This is an opportunity to lay down a marker, that any development of that kind should have a community or social clause in it that will provide community gain and that there will be an aspect regarding local employment and training. That is recommended on page 35 of the report. If it continues as the Taoiseach has outlined, the community will not be satisfied with being told what is best for it by statutory people. It knows what is best for it. I would urge the Taoiseach to have that meeting with the conveners as soon as possible.

I would remind Deputy O'Sullivan that in respect of housing, which she mentioned, the north and south inner city housing plans include €30 million for the regeneration of Dominick Street and €27 million for the regeneration of St. Teresa's Gardens. There is also the new multi-million euro plan to develop O'Devaney gardens and a lot of other support for investment in community supports and housing. The setting up of an office in the north inner city is not about having statutory people removed from the community. It is for the community to be in there, to be involved and to ask what is happening with project X or project Y in their location so that everybody understands that both the moneys that are being continued and the new moneys that are being invested are for regeneration for the people of the area and that it is not just a case of outsiders moving in and telling the community to do this or that. All aspects of this report came from people in that locality themselves. They said that this was what they wanted for their area and asked how best they could implement it. It is under way. I will meet them but I want to have the office set up and I want to have the system in place. Then we can talk about possible greater community representation but believe me, the consultation and the opportunity for community involvement will be there on a constant basis because there will be an office in the north inner city. 
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	30	I was saddened to hear this morning of the death of Martin McGuinness. His passing represents a significant loss not only to politics in Northern Ireland but to the wider political landscape on this island and beyond. Martin McGuinness will always be remembered for the remarkable political journey he undertook in his lifetime. Not only did he come to believe that peace must prevail but he committed himself to working tirelessly to that end and living for his convictions to that end. He was one of the chief architects of the Good Friday Agreement and he worked resolutely in the years that followed it in pursuit of its full implementation. He became Sinn Féin's chief negotiator in the talks that led to the Agreement and after the Good Friday Agreement was concluded, he was returned as a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly and served as Minister of Education between 1999 and 2002. Mr. McGuinness went on to serve as deputy First Minister with three DUP First Ministers - Ian Paisley, Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster - before retiring from active politics in January of this year. His relationship with the late Dr. Ian Paisley in particular was remarkable given the very different backgrounds they came from. It was a mark of the man that Martin McGuinness was that he worked so closely and effectively with Ian Paisley for the betterment of all the people of Northern Ireland. As we know, he built a strong personal friendship with Ian Paisley which for many would be one of the most enduring images of reconciliation on this island. As deputy First Minister, he displayed great leadership despite being exposed to political criticism and indeed personal risk. This legacy of leadership will no doubt inspire the next generation of leaders in Northern Ireland. I got to know him well in recent years, including through our working together on the North-South Ministerial Council. His commitment to securing enduring peace and prosperity for all the people of Northern Ireland was unwavering throughout this time. He strove to make Northern Ireland a better place for everyone regardless of background or tradition. I spoke with him on the telephone a few weeks ago when I expressed the hope that he would recover his full health. Unfortunately, this was not to be. Above all, today is an especially sad day for his family - his wife Bernie, his children, Fiachra, Emmet, Fionnuala and Grainne, his grandchildren and the extended McGuinness family - and, of course, the people of Derry, who always held a special place in Martin McGuinness's heart. I offer my deepest sympathy to all of them at this sad and difficult time.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	31	On behalf of our party leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, and the entire Fianna Fáil Party, I extend sincere sympathies to the McGuinness family and Sinn Féin on the loss of Martin McGuinness. I hope his wife Bernie and his children, Fiachra, Emmet, Fionnuala and Grainne, get some consolation from the great accolades and genuinely held tributes Martin has received today to acknowledge his sterling work in the name of peace building on our island. It is important to acknowledge that while we all knew Martin as a public figure, Bernie has lost her loving husband and his four children and grandchildren have lost their father and grandfather. Their loss is, of course, the greatest of all. Martin's death represents a very sad moment in the shared history of the island of Ireland. Martin was heavily involved, as we know, in the army council of the IRA for many years of the Troubles - his views no doubt shaped by his upbringing in Derry and the treatment of Catholics as a young boy growing up there. When he converted to full-time politics, he removed himself from conflict. He also managed to convert many hardened IRA members to peace and politics. This will be a very significant part of his legacy. In the early 1990s, Martin used to meet with the late Albert Reynolds who it is recognised among others laid the building blocks for the Good Friday Agreement, which was eventually negotiated in 1998. Martin was always spoken about as being a man of his word and when he decided to commit to the peace process, he condemned acts of violence on all sides.  History will judge Martin's transition to peace as being a welcome and committed one. This is not to say that we can forget or ignore the many deaths that occurred during the Troubles. History will, of course, record a fuller assessment of his entire legacy but more than most, Martin McGuinness embraced the peace process with a generosity of spirit that won people over. By his actions and words over the past 25 years, he demonstrated a keen understanding of what the peace process was all about. He worked to build bridges between the different traditions and communities on the island. He reached out to the Unionist community in particular and to its leaders to steer Northern Ireland towards a better shared future.As the Taoiseach stated, his leadership with the former DUP leader, the late Reverend Ian Paisley, was quite remarkable and seems incredible when we look back on it now. It is a testament to his character, determination, ability and charisma that he managed to work so closely with the late Reverend Dr. Ian Paisley. Throughout his political career, Martin McGuinness had a clear commitment to the disadvantaged and saw the pivotal role education can play in providing equality of opportunity for all. Despite the peace process going through a rocky period at the time, he retained a respect on all sides and never allowed the politics of the situation to affect the personal relationships he held. He was deeply committed to reconciliation, retained respect from all sides and always managed to have personal relationships with others. I hope his work in the peace process will inspire others to follow his legacy by continuing to build stronger bridges between both traditions on this island. This peace can never be taken for granted. It is crucial that the lasting peace is founded on a greater understanding by Nationalists and Unionists of each other. We all look forward to when citizens' concerns will get priority over the actual labels into which they are born. Today, I hope that Martin McGuinness's legacy of reaching out to Unionists can be reciprocated because it is in the interests of all communities in the North and throughout the island of Ireland that all citizens on the island can co-operate and peacefully co-exist. He wanted to make peace on all sides and would never want to go back to the violence of the Troubles. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	32	Above anything else, Martin McGuinness was a proud Derryman. There is no doubt that his childhood and young life in the Bogside formed him, shaped him and defined his character. Martin was born in 1950 into an Orange, discriminatory state. He, his family and his kind were regarded as second-class citizens. They endured terror. Martin, a person of courage, chose to stand up and be counted. He chose to fight injustice. He chose to fight back. I know that he felt a deep sense of personal responsibility to defend Derry and his community. Martin joined the IRA. He never resiled from his ambition or his duty to defend his city. He felt a sense of responsibility to fight back because terror was brought to the streets of his city. In later years, Martin would show that same courage again and again and not least as chief negotiator on behalf of our political party in crafting and delivering the Good Friday Agreement and the agreements which followed. In bringing forward that work, Martin demonstrated not just his courage, but his considerable political skills, personality and ability to build bridges and work with others. He always believed that, whatever the odds, a good outcome was possible. In the course of his work, he demonstrated that to be true. As Minister of Education, Martin handled and tackled the issue of educational inequality head on when he took on the 11-plus. In taking on the 11-plus, he took on large sections of the educational establishment and the establishment more generally. Martin believed that every person was born equal and that every child deserved equality of opportunity. Perhaps it is in his role as deputy First Minister for ten years that Martin's star shone most brightly. In reaching not just a partnership, but a deep personal friendship, with the late Ian Paisley and in his work with Peter Robinson and - let it be said - Arlene Foster, Martin demonstrated not just by words but by deeds his intention, ability and resolve to build peace. He famously met the Queen for the first occasion. I thought they hit it off rather well, which I said to him at the time. Martin visited the Somme and I accompanied him on one such trip. He developed very strong personal ties and relationships with many people from what is termed the other side of the community. He did this work sincerely, not for show or headlines but because he believed and knew it was the right thing to do. All the while, Martin never lost his essence as an Irish republican. His absolute commitment to Irish unity, justice and full democracy on the island of Ireland remained undimmed and it was never dimmed by his ability to reach out the hand of friendship to the other side. Martin McGuinness was an international as well as a domestic figure, an outstanding statesman and proud republican, a worker for reconciliation, a champion of peace, an IRA volunteer, a risk taker and a hope giver. He was also a committed family man who made it his business to return home each and every evening that he was in the Assembly in Belfast. He was immensely proud of his children, Fiachra, Fionnuala, Grainne and Emmet, his grandchildren and his wider family. Martin never missed an opportunity to tell the story of and praise his clan. He loved his wife, Bernie, who was, without doubt, the centre of his world. Today, we offer Bernie and the rest of Martin's family our deep condolences.  We, on these benches, have lost not just a leader but a friend. We will never see his likes again. Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann. 
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	33	Like many in this House, I was saddened when I turned on RTE radio this morning to hear of the death of Martin McGuinness. As on all such occasions, our first thoughts are with his wife, Bernie, his children and grandchildren and his extended family, which, as others have said, were the first centre of his life. I also think of the Sinn Féin Deputies who knew Martin as a friend and colleague and all of those outside this House who also knew him as a friend and colleague. The role Martin McGuinness played in bringing peace and reconciliation to our island will never be forgotten. He did not do so alone but his was an important role. As we remember his life, we cannot escape the appreciation of how far we have come since the darkest days of the Troubles. Many of us have been privileged to have been many decades in this House and we have seen a slow evolution from a very dark place to a better place. As we remember Martin McGuinness's life, we also think that his, like all our lives, is written in chapters. It is appropriate that today we concentrate largely on the later chapters of that life and leave the rest to the historians. It is clear, however, that Martin McGuinness was a man who came to realise that the way to peace is through understanding, empathy and compromise and not through other means.  Many will remember - some in this House have already referenced it - the moment five years ago that Martin McGuinness shook hands with Queen Elizabeth on her visit to Belfast. As was pointed out in the media this morning, such a gesture between a former IRA commander and the head of the British Commonwealth would once have been unimaginable. We will not forget Martin McGuinness's real and truly warm relationship with Ian Paisley. Peace is essentially built upon human understanding and personal friendships. That two people from such opposing walks of life could come together to walk the path towards a common goal of achieving peace and stability in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland is a testament to how politics can bridge even the darkest divisions between us.

I know they are all very saddened but they also have great cause to be very proud. We would like to offer our condolences, as has been mentioned, to the citizens of Derry who have experienced a double whammy over recent days following the loss of Ryan McBride as well. I know I should not do this but, on a personal note, my own family knew Martin because my parents were great republicans and my mother would like to offer her condolences as well. Martin was, like others, a child of the civil rights movement. Many people, such as John Hume, Eamonn McCann and Bernadette Devlin, were products of that legitimate movement of resistance to discrimination, sectarianism and state repression. The ongoing debate about how we finally end sectarianism and partition is a matter of continuous struggle for all of us but no one could doubt Martin McGuinness's commitment to his tireless struggle for a united Ireland, a cause he so passionately believed in and a cause he served with great honour and dignity. His comrades will be hugely proud of him. Suaimhneas agus síocháin go deo dó.

Tá sé an-bhrónach dóibh go léir faoi láthair. Our country had a turbulent and violent 800 years under the British empire before the Twenty-six Counties gained independence, but that turbulence and violence continued much longer for the Six Counties. That time, known as the Troubles, brought a great deal of pain, devastation and loss to many people. Individuals, parties and groups in the North took different paths. For some, it was a path of war and violence; for others, it was the path of peace. Martin McGuinness was a person who journeyed on both paths. On the few occasions I met him, it was obvious that he was a warm person, a man with a sense of humour and someone who was very committed to his principles. Gan dabht, is féidir linn a rá gur dhein sé difríocht. Rinne sé éacht ar son na síochána sa tír seo. He made a difference because he was willing to communicate, talk, listen, engage and compromise. May he rest in peace.

A generation of young Irish people have come of age never having known the awful and terrible violence of the Northern Ireland conflict. Thanks in large part to the political and personal courage he displayed, they did not know that. I say to his family, to Sinn Féin and, in particular, to my colleague, Deputy Martin Ferris, that he was a proud Derryman from the Bogside who never forgot where he came from and who wanted to defend at all times his people, as Deputy McDonald said. He did that in a courageous way and he did everything to the best of his ability at all times. He played a political role that will be remembered forever. There are people alive today who have children who have seen adulthood, which might not have happened but for the work of Martin McGuinness and people like him over a number of years. Everybody knows he had a great sense of humour and, on a day like this, it is right to remember something like that. Around this time last year, I was in hospital recovering from an altercation with a cow. He rang me and he wondered how I was doing. When I informed him how I was, he laughed. When I asked him what he was laughing at, he said, "I have just thought of something very funny; I would hate to be that cow." He was a very nice man and I will always remember him fondly. May he rest in peace. God bless him.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	37	We in the Social Democrats were very saddened to hear of the death of Martin McGuinness. It was a very short illness and it certainly feels sudden and untimely. We extend our sympathies to his wife and family and also to the Sinn Féin Party which will be feeling a huge void as a result of his passing. During the Troubles, Ireland, and particularly Northern Ireland, experienced some of its darkest hours when politics failed and violence took over. The peace process that followed was one of the finest hours for politics. That is what it was - a process. At all times, it needed, and needs, leadership. Martin McGuinness's willingness to work with people and the strength of character he showed by taking ownership of his past while acknowledging the need to move away from it helped to take this island beyond conflict and destruction and into a modern democracy. It is not surprising today on the occasion of his passing that we hear many warm tributes paid to him. None of us would have predicted when the Good Friday Agreement was signed that such a warm and successful relationship would have been struck up between Martin McGuinness and Dr. Ian Paisley. The warmth and honesty of that relationship is not written into any agreement, nor could it be, but is the very human thing that was an essential component in developing the respect and reconciliation needed to make the peace process successful to date. May he rest in peace. I ask that we also be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the family of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick and the hope for the recovery of the crew of helicopter R116, and to the families of Maureen Haughey and Ryan McBride.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	38	On behalf of the Green Party, North and South, I extend our commiseration to all those affected by the loss of life in recent days but especially to the family of Martin McGuinness and to his colleagues in Sinn Féin. My colleague, Steven Agnew said today that Martin "brought great gravitas to the Executive Office but also managed to stay true to his down to earth nature." That is something I saw in the work we did on the British-Irish Council. He had warmth and at the same time steely determination which is a great combination in politics. More than anything else, if we are reflecting on his life in politics, we have to reflect on that ability to change. He is someone who went from being at the very centre of the Troubles to being at the very centre of solutions. A quote was used recently by President Obama in his final speech as American President which is appropriate. He quoted Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird who said, "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view ... until you climb into his skin and walk around in it." As others have mentioned here, that relationship and ability to see from the other side, particularly from Dr. Ian Paisley's, allowed some of the peace and development we have seen in recent decades which has been so valuable to all of us. I heard Ian Paisley Jnr. today saying that as a Christian one judges someone at the end on the closing chapters of their life. In that context, all of us, North and South, Nationalist and Unionist are celebrating the life of Martin McGuinness, although his death is a tragic loss for his family, and the contribution he made to all the people of this island.

An issue that they, especially the Coast Guard's volunteer members, have been raising consistently is the need for statutory recognition of the service. As the Taoiseach knows, the other forms of emergency response - the Garda and the fire and ambulance services - have statutory recognition.Many Deputies in this House have raised the issue with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. As I understand it the legislation goes back to 1856. Deputy Troy raised the issue with the Minister recently. The Minister is of the view that legislation is not necessary but I urge the Taoiseach to personally examine the matter to establish whether there is a need for statutory recognition of the Irish Coast Guard service. Those involved in providing the very services on which we rely passionately believe there is such a need. I urge the Taoiseach to examine the issue, discuss it with the Minister and revert to the House.

I welcome his remarks in respect of the plight of the undocumented Irish citizens in the US. I also noted in Philadelphia the Taoiseach announced the Government would hold a long-overdue referendum in respect of voting rights in presidential elections. As the Taoiseach is aware, we have been pressing him and his colleagues for some time to allow citizens in the North and in the diaspora to have a vote in presidential elections. The Taoiseach is also aware the Constitutional Convention proposed in September 2013, quite some time ago, that such a referendum should be held. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs also made such a recommendation. Having made the announcement in Philadelphia that the referendum would be brought forward, could the Taoiseach tell us today when the legislation to allow for the referendum will come before the Dáil?

Last May I asked the Taoiseach about progress on the legislation and he gave me an assurance at that point that it would proceed, yet we have seen very little progress in the full year that has elapsed since the election. The Taoiseach is very well aware of my own interest in the creation of a university in the south east, which was a commitment in the previous programme for Government. He is also aware there are other colleges urgently awaiting this legislation. Is the Taoiseach committed to enacting the Bill and when?

He is correct, this is very important legislation because it traces a future for the institutes of technology to form more effective technological universities that would drive regional performance. It is not that we have been idle. It is not just a matter of legislation and bringing in a set of amendments to the committee, it is a case of making sure that we have all of the institutions committed to the path and we are working on that. There have also been issues concerning industrial relations which we need to resolve. It is not simply a matter of coming into the Dáil with a set of amendments. We want to make sure that when we do so we have the required level of commitment and a clear signposted path ahead for the various institutions.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	54	First, we should acknowledge that today is the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. We should acknowledge the Taoiseach's new global status as the champion of immigrants. He had 30 million plus hits for his speech in Washington. I invite the Taoiseach to co-sign a motion that has already been signed by 36 Deputies to end direct provision in this country. Deputy Boyd Barrett told me that he was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions which recommended ending direct provision two years ago. Direct provision was described by the former judge, Bryan McMahon, as a deplorable system, one in which people are like ghosts and that they are dehumanised and depressed. Two weeks ago during the debate on the Tuam babies issues, the Taoiseach said he hoped in 20 years' time that another Taoiseach would not have to stand in the Chamber and make an apology for the way people are treated in institutions in this country. I am concerned that if we do not set out to end the inhumane direct provision system we will be looking at a generation of children who were raised under those conditions who are dehumanised, depressed and ignored. Could we get cross-party agreement to dedicate some time to discussing this very fundamental and important issue and to seek to find a way to implement the decision of the committee to end direct provision?

The section was negotiated last May with many rural Deputies and there was a commitment to actively encourage the payment of social welfare payments through the post office and to allow other Government services to be supplied through post offices but none of that has happened. The Taoiseach also committed to support the introduction of an e-payment system in post offices to facilitate financial services in post offices. In particular, he gave a commitment to exploring community banking such as exists in Germany and New Zealand. The post office is a very important part of the fabric of rural communities. Is it the Taoiseach's intention to allow the post office network to be decimated through inaction and a failure to deliver on the commitments in the programme for Government?

In the programme for Government a commitment was given to protect the viability of post offices. The Government is failing miserably to do that. We had a sham before St. Patrick's week when a Minister showed up for a Topical Issue debate only to tell Deputies that he had no responsibility. Who is directly responsible for the protection of the post office network? The Taoiseach should believe me when I say it will not be 80 or 200 post offices but that 700 post offices will close. I have been saying that for the past six years. Unfortunately, when one looks at today's newspaper it says that up to half-----

It is in the programme for Government. The Taoiseach knows the problems we have. There are solutions. As postmasters, we are not looking for a handout from the Government. It is no such thing. We are not coming to ask the Government to bail us out and give us money. What we are saying is that community banking should be introduced into post offices. It worked in Japan, Germany and New Zealand.

The post office sector is undergoing very considerable change both at national and international level, with dramatic changes in electronic communications and online transactions having a heavy impact on the volumes of mail and other service offerings. An Post is a commercial State body and decisions relating to the size and distribution of the network are a matter for the board of management. The Government recently lifted the cap in respect of the price of stamps because of the urgency of this matter from a financial perspective. The Government is committed to supporting the sustainability of the post office network as set out in the programme for Government. As there was such a volume of material for the Cabinet this morning, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, was not in a position to present his report; the Kerr report was commissioned by the Government in respect of the post office network.

The Minister put on the record of this House during Leaders' Questions on 9 February this year a reply when I asked her about it. She stated that the report referenced in The Sunday Times article had questions related to it answered in the justice committee, with detailed information put on record about the audit and actions taken internally. I do not know about the internal actions but it has not gone through the justice committee. She also indicated it went to the Committee of Public Accounts but I raised the matter there after the date in question. The committee wrote to the Garda Commissioner and she has only sent an acknowledgement of it. That was January of this year. There has been no public scrutiny of this serious issue and there are real questions about funds in Templemore. There is also the issue of this House being told that something went through a process in and was considered by the justice committee when it did not and was not. The record of the House must be corrected. At this point, the final report should be published by the Minister so this can receive the scrutiny that it needs.

In the same week he lobbied the US Administration for immigration reform for the undocumented Irish. While he was in the United States, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland held a rally in Dublin calling for the same treatment for the approximately 26,000 undocumented migrants living in this State. The Taoiseach's case to the US Administration would surely be stronger if he practised at home what he preached while abroad. Will he bring forward legislation that will provide undocumented migrants living in this State with an opportunity to regularise their status?

The current revaluation occurring in many counties also exacerbates the concerns of those businesses. As opposed to hearing it in this House, we read in yesterday's newspaper that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is in the process of introducing some changes. I refer specifically to the fact that heads of a Bill were promised for publication. Many Deputies and I have asked over the past number of months when we could expect timelines on the introduction of this legislation. Businesses and small businesses in particular are suffering and need change. I ask the Taoiseach to specifically indicate when it will come to the House and when we can expect a change in this archaic, 150-year-old system.

When will we have an opportunity to debate such a scheme in this House?

It is important to bear in mind that this must be targeted and very focused. It must define accurately the categories that are required.

This is not a case of pitting town against town, as happened before. There are opportunities for every region and Sligo is one of those potentially very major centres, with access in terms of roads to be completed and so on. The fact that the advance factory is almost completed is an advantage for Sligo. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor to give Deputy McLoughlin an indication of the interest being expressed in filling that location with jobs.

I myself promoted it on two occasions in the past week in the US. The Deputy has a wonderful facility there. He will be aware that I visited the facility and other facilities in Sligo. I also met the chamber of commerce and the local trading organisation there and I am confident that IDA Ireland will be able to get good clients. As Minister, I remind the House it is not only IDA Ireland. Enterprise Ireland is a very good enterprise agency and is also bringing jobs to a community, as are the LEOs. We are there with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs to try and make sure that we land jobs in regional areas.

As the Taoiseach will be aware, one can see in many parts of the country floods are beginning to rise again and there is a lot of worry among the people. This is the question I have for the Taoiseach. Before Christmas there was an announcement that a dredging programme for the River Shannon would commence. Can the Taoiseach give me any indication - perhaps Deputy Moran, behind the Taoiseach, can tell him - as to when that programme will commence because that is a major issue?

The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, is working hard on this and I will get him to give Deputy Murphy an update on the locations, pinch point or otherwise, where action can be taken here. As the Deputy will also be aware, it is not a case of cleaning out the entire Shannon Basin. It is a slow-moving river and there are consequences. I will have the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, give Deputy Murphy an update.

There has been a lot of worry in schools that this circular did not ring-fence guidance counselling. The Taoiseach provided a note to my leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, which made clear that the guidance provision was ex quota but that has not been made clear to schools, and schools are now going ahead on the basis that it is not ex quota. I suggest that the note the Taoiseach gave to Deputy Micheál Martin be issued immediately to all the schools in the country to which it is relevant.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23382	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	108	The position is that we have made provision in a circular that the provision for guidance counselling would be ring-fenced. It is in accordance with the approach to guidance counselling, which is a whole-school guidance counselling approach, that was adopted by Deputy Thomas Byrne's leader in the 2000s. At this stage, we have restored 50% of the provision. It will rise to 66% this coming September. Deputy Thomas Byrne raised with me concerns that the management bodies had issued some directive. We have confirmed with them that there has not been any such directive. We are issuing the provision. We are ensuring that this is a ring-fenced provision for guidance counselling. We will, if necessary, inspect to ensure that. We will be conducting a survey to establish fully the practise that is going on.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	109	As the Taoiseach will be aware, in the programme for Government there is a commitment to ensure that the Irish agrifood sector finds new markets and develops everywhere around the world. In recent days, we have an issue in regard to Brazilian beef and poultry. There is a scandal in that country where they find that there are many people being bribed and so on to allow substandard product be exported. I understand the European Commission today has banned the importation into Europe from four companies involved in this. In the context of the commitment from the Government to ensure that the finest quality Irish product is exported and competes fairly around the world, will the Taoiseach ensure that the European Commission bans all meat product from Brazil and undertakes a review of the standards of food coming from non-European countries?

Deputies of all sides of the House raised the issue and a commission was set up to look at the overall picture. I am very worried because I understand the commission, while it is looking at this, is proposing no change. I have a three-classroom school in a village that the Taoiseach passes through regularly and, because of the regulation that was introduced in 1967 in regard to the distance of two miles that a pupil must live from a national school, unfortunately, this school will lose a teacher this year. An overall look at what is happening in school transport needs to be taken immediately.

The Bill amends the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 by inserting a new Part 4A. It provides for control of the export of greyhounds and for the publication of a white list of countries to which the export of greyhounds under licence will only be permissible. The Bill will also make it an offence for persons to export greyhounds to countries not on the white list and will provide for related matters. I thank Ms Suzie Carley, the executive director of Dogs Trust, and her staff for their powerful advocacy and research on this Bill and for bringing this matter to the Legislature and the public. Dogs Trust has been in Ireland since 2005 and has re-homed 7,000 dogs since 2009. Indeed, they re-homed almost 3,000 in 2016 alone.Along with the ISPCA and Bord na gCon, the Dogs Trust is a welfare member of the International Greyhound Forum. Pursuant to the new section 27B proposed in the Bill, welfare members of the forum will be given a statutory role in preparing draft and finalised lists for submission to the Minister which he will declare the white list of countries that meet minimum standards regarding the welfare of greyhounds. Last April and May, there was a public outcry when reports confirmed that three Irish greyhounds had been exported to Macau, China, to race in the infamous Yat Yuen canidrome, which has a well-documented and deplorable record in terms of the welfare of greyhounds. Around this time, 24 greyhounds were also returned to Ireland from the UK after being stopped en route to China. There are reports that in the canidrome unless a greyhound finishes in the top three in five consecutive races it is destroyed. In response to the public outpouring of anger at the treatment of these greyhounds, Bord na gCon, the Irish Greyhound Board, issued a statement saying it had no control over events outside the jurisdiction of Ireland and did not have a role in regulating the export of greyhounds. The statement went on to say:While IGB does not have a statutory remit in relation to export controls for greyhounds, we expect owners to apply the principles set out in the Code of Practice when exporting greyhounds in accordance with our guidance issued to the industry. When I raised this matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, by means of parliamentary questions, I was told that two greyhounds were exported to China in 2014 and that nine were exported in 2016. The Minister said he endorsed the Bord na gCon advice I have outlined. This matter needs to be placed on a statutory footing because it is clear that some owners are choosing to ignore the advice given by Bord na gCon and, of course, because the reputational damage to Ireland of exporting our greyhounds to countries such as China should not be underestimated. I note the report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, produced in January 2016, on the greyhound racing industry in Ireland. I welcome reports that progress is being made in implementing the 27 recommendations for the industry arising from the July 2014 Indecon report, Review of Certain Matters Relating to Bord na gCon. I also note the proposed upcoming greyhound industry (amendment) Bill, which will provide for amendments to both the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 and the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011. Given that figures provided to me via a reply to a parliamentary question indicate that 10,175 dogs were exported from 550 registered premises in 2015, surely we can now prioritise the development of a white list of countries to ensure that greyhounds are only exported to countries with welfare standards that are equal to or higher than those which obtain in Ireland. Besides the export of these wonderful sentient dogs that are synonymous with Ireland, there are many other aspects of greyhound welfare that I have not touched on this afternoon but which require urgent attention from the Minister. The Greyhound Rescue Association of Ireland reports that approximately 38 greyhounds are put down each month, that there are major issues regarding the traceability of thousands of greyhounds and the accountability of some owners, and that just one prosecution has been brought against an individual who did not comply with a welfare notice from Bord na gCon in 2014. We need far more inspections of breeding establishments, licensing and microchipping for all greyhounds from birth, and sufficient resources provided for rehoming of retired greyhounds. On Thursday, 9 March, RTE's "Prime Time" aired its "Gone to the Dogs" programme in which Sharon Ní Bheoláin and her team highlighted the problems with doping and very poor regulation in the greyhound industry. The programme raised a number of very serious questions on animal welfare and I sincerely hope the Minister will address all of the relevant issues in his upcoming Bill. There have recently been major discussions in places such as New South Wales about the whole future of greyhound racing. Of course, 80% of the racing greyhounds on British tracks come from Ireland. Such is the problem with doping here that the UK Government has started mandatory testing on greyhounds exported from Ireland since 1 January 2017. The simple Bill before the House is, therefore, a timely supplement to the promised upcoming legislative improvements in respect of the welfare of these wonderful animals in Ireland. I urge the Government to accept and pass it.

In 2016 my Department received 275 freedom of information requests, which was a 59% increase over the number of requests received in 2014, the year in which the new Freedom of Information Act came into operation. Of the 275 requests received in 2016, 51 were fully granted, 133 were part-granted and 57 were refused, including five where no records were held. There were requests for internal review in respect of seven cases and there was one appeal to the Office of the Information Commissioner. There are two staff in my Department's FOI unit, both of whom also have other duties. Staff from across the Department are also involved in processing requests in addition to their routine duties, for example, in searching and retrieving records and making decisions on the requests received.

It is certainly a substantial number at 275. I ask the Taoiseach about the Open Government Partnership, which, he will recall, I signed Ireland up to on behalf of the Government. It is an initiative of 70 countries which aims to secure concrete commitments from governments on transparency, the empowerment of citizens, the fight against corruption and harnessing new technologies to strengthen governance. Ireland's Open Government Partnership national action plan was published in December. Commitment No. 11 is to develop an open data strategy and represents the fundamental plank of what we wanted to do in signing up to the partnership. We wanted to go beyond freedom of information so that the default position would be open access to data whereby people could interrogate as a matter of course all the information available to the State. On the open data website, www.data.gov.ie, the Department of the Taoiseach is not listed as a data provider. What role does the Department have in providing data and what is the Taoiseach's attitude to the Open Government Partnership initiative and the open data commitment in the national action plan?

The two questions put down relate to the numbers of FOI requests received. As the Deputy will be well aware from his own time as a Minister, one never sees these requests and has nothing to do with them. I have advised the Department to put them all up on the website when they are processed to let everybody see them. Some of the requests that come in are purely nonsensical while others are of particular interest to those who ask them. I remember entertaining the former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mr. John Beohner, at Lahinch where he wanted to play a round of golf a couple of years ago. We did not play on the course further down the coast.

The club invited us in for a bowl of soup, a couple of sandwiches and a cup of coffee and, I declare to God, the following week, the Department received an FOI request to know how much this cost the State. I do not know how much it cost the State to provide the answer that there was no charge at all.

I do not see these things at all. I will come back to Deputy Howlin with more detail because he signed the document. I never see any of them and I rarely hear about them, but I told the Department to put them all up on the website so everybody can see what was actually sought. I will come back to the Deputy with the specific information to which he referred.

This includes building on freedom of information reforms and committing to further changes, including a more open freedom of information regime. Under the Act, people have the right to access records held by bodies under the aegis of the legislation. These bodies must give people an explanation if they are not given what they asked for and normally that decision must be made within four weeks. Our experience in submitting freedom of information requests and securing responses within the specified period falls very short of the commitment made in the legislation, and we are not making inquiries about how much the Taoiseach's sandwiches and soup cost in Lahinch or elsewhere.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	141	Nothing.

For example, the time taken to release information is significantly longer than the four weeks specified and, in fact, it can often take up to three months. We have found that only after repeated calls, e-mails and virtually wrestling with bureaucracy, which, by the way, does not seem terribly happy with the idea of providing information that would not normally be in the public domain, we may eventually get a response and in those circumstances sometimes we see great creativity by the civil servants. We can get reams of information already in the public domain rather than the specific information requested. In 2011, and again last year in the programme for Government, the Taoiseach spoke about the need for ending secretiveness in government and providing greater transparency and accountability, which is the open government system to which Deputy Howlin referred, but the experience is very different. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the structure laid out in the legislation, including the timeframe for answering freedom of information requests, will be adhered to? Will he tell us what discussions have been held and with whom in this regard and what progress has been made? Will he indicate what legislative or other changes are envisaged to ensure the more open freedom of information regime to which the Taoiseach has committed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	143	With regard to the Freedom of Information Acts, the procedures used by the Department followed the guidelines set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's decision-makers manual. I am satisfied the processes being followed by the Department comply fully with the manual. Systems are in place to ensure requests are answered within a set timeframe. My Department has a database which is dedicated to processing freedom of information requests. The database allows the Department to know the details and status of every request. It is monitored by the freedom of information liaison officer who receives all requests, logs them on the system and refers them to the appropriate division for reply. I do not have the exact figure to hand in respect of the number answered outside the 20 day statutory framework of 2016, but I understand approximately 50% of the requests received were answered outside the timeframe. I emphasise though that many of the replies which were answered late issued within a few days of the statutory deadline and in many of these cases it should be noted it was agreed with the requesters that replies could issue slightly outside the statutory deadline where, for example, the decision-makers were attending to other duties or for pressure of work reasons because the Department does not have full-time freedom of information officers. It should also be noted that there has been a significant increase in the number of freedom of information requests received by the Department since the abolition on 14 October 2014 of the application fees for freedom of information requests. In 2013, the Department received 92 freedom of information requests, while this figure rose to 290 in 2015 and 275 in 2016. Quite a broad span of people answer these questions and there is not a specific figure we can give for the time spent by officials on answering the queries that come in.

Is this at the same time as they are provided to the requester? This is a very good idea because it gives the public an opportunity to evaluate them given that not all freedom of information requests are of equal value. There is a really important underpinning of democracy in having access to information, but an inordinate amount of public service time and cost goes into frivolous repetitive freedom of information requests, often accessing data that is freely available through other means if the requesters sought it. It would be a good idea if there was a general Government policy whereby at the same time as the information is given to the requester, it is published.

Half the concern about the fee was that it would act as a disincentive for people to lodge freedom of information requests. I am certainly not trying to be a champion for vexatious or frivolous requests, such as the one outlined by the Taoiseach about sandwiches and the cost of a bowl of soup, but it is important to note that very many of the requests made are far from frivolous. They are genuine legitimate attempts to seek information which, if we had truly open government, might automatically be in the public domain. The Taoiseach gave the figures on the number of applications received. Did he state the figure of 275 was an increase of 50%?

The process can be quite cumbersome and many replies come back late. The people submitting the request are contacted and asked whether they mind if the reply is late, but they do not really have any choice in the matter because if they force the issue, the response could be incomplete. Some of the redactions are pretty inexplicable. The freedom of information officer seems to have quite an amount of discretion on this issue and we cannot judge as recipients whether it is fair and reasonable and that the number of redactions is justified. With regard to freedom of information requests by Members of the Oireachtas, if the responses we receive to parliamentary questions were more detailed, many freedom of information requests from Members would not be necessary. Obviously, if we want the backup documentation, we must go through the freedom of information process because typically they do not come with replies to parliamentary questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	154	Deputy Howlin raised a good point. Sometimes when people in the media send in a freedom of information request to a Department or Minister, they like to say the information is an exclusive although it might be available through public sources anyway. No more than when the Deputy was a Minister and he never saw these requests coming in because they were dealt with completely outside his influence or remit by the freedom of information officer, and whatever redactions were to be made were made by the officer unless there was an appeal to the commissioner subsequently, I do not see the requests.It would be a good thing to put up all the requests that are received and, on the day that the information is available, to put it all up again so that everybody knows. Perhaps we should look at it in some other way to see if it can be improved again. There is such a mountain of information that people are probably not going to go through much of it. There could be ten questions in one request and it might cover quite a range of material. There was an increase in the number of requests that were lodged when the fee was abolished by the Government in the interests of increasing the capacity to be able to apply for information. Deputy Mary Lou McDonald asked about the numbers that were granted. I have the information for 2016. Some 275 requests were received and 51 were fully granted, 133 were part-granted and 57 were refused, including five where no records were held. There were requests for internal reviews in seven cases and there was one appeal to the Office of the Information Commissioner. I do not know why they were refused or what they were about, but if Deputy McDonald wants similar information for some other years, I can forward that to her too, including numbers that were refused or part-refused. Section 8 of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 requires each freedom of information, FOI, body, including my Department, to prepare and publish a publication scheme with as much information as possible about its work in an open and accessible manner on a routine basis outside of the FOI system, having regard to the principles of openness, transparency and accountability as set out in the Act. This allows for the publication or giving of records outside the FOI process, provided such publication or giving of access is not prohibited by law. The scheme commits FOI bodies to make information available as part of their normal business activities in accordance with this scheme. In the spirit of openness and transparency, my Department's publication scheme publishes a range of information on a quarterly basis on the Department's website. This includes details of foreign travel expenses, details of invoices paid in excess of €20,000, minutes of the Department's management advisory committee meetings and a log of freedom of information requests. Deputy Michael McGrath said that if further information is given in parliamentary questions, it might obviate the need to make freedom of information requests in some cases. I support that and have always said to Department officials to provide as much information as is appropriate and of value to the requester of the information in the first place by way of Dáil questions and so on.

My Department's strategy statement sets out the key objectives for the Department for the period of 2016 to 2019. The strategy statement is aligned to the Government's key priorities and policies and sets out six strategic priorities. These include providing excellent support services for the Taoiseach and Government, ensuring Ireland has a sustainable economy, helping to ensure that Government policies and services support a socially inclusive and fair society, and ensuring that Ireland maintains strong relationships in Europe and the world. It also includes ensuring the best possible outcome for Ireland in relation to Brexit, which includes protecting the common travel area and the peace process, as well as developing North-South co-operation. It also includes planning for the future in the context of all of the many uncertainties arising in the international environment. The strategy statement recognises the central and co-ordinating role of the Department to ensure that policies are developed and implemented which support economic development and social progress. Recognising that Brexit is the major issue facing Ireland, the Department created a newly amalgamated international, EU and Northern division under a new second Secretary General. The work of this division includes supporting the Cabinet committees on Brexit and European affairs, overseeing the overall Government response to Brexit, including both the economic impact and the negotiations at EU level and with the Administrations in London and Belfast. The parliamentary liaison unit referred to in the strategy statement was established to perform a liaison function to help ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly informed of new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second Dáil. The unit liaises on a regular basis with advisers to the Independent members of Government in performing this function, including the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for the Independent Ministers in government to ensure that they are informed of Oireachtas issues and to assist them in engaging with the new processes arising from Dáil reform. Progress is reviewed on a regular basis by my Department's management advisory committee and by senior management in each division. The Secretary General holds a quarterly meeting with all staff at which progress across all aspects of the strategy statement is reviewed. My Department publishes an annual report formally setting out progress achieved across all the strategic priorities.

The Government's multiple failures regarding housing and homelessness, health, including mental health, and water, are just some of the issues that expose the inadequacy of the strategic objectives set out in the strategy statement. The paper sets as one of the Department's core activities the formulation of policy with regard to the North. Negotiations are currently under way to restore the political institutions in the North and, indeed, are in their final and crucial week. Sinn Féin has met daily with the other Assembly parties and the two Governments as part of the implementation talks at Stormont Castle. There are significant obstacles in the way of progress, as the Taoiseach is aware. Not least of these is the British Government's deliberate blocking of money for the commencement of legacy inquests. All of the families involved have suffered the grievous loss of loved ones, and they have the basic right to expect that inquests will be held. Some have been waiting for over four decades. The British Government needs to stop hiding behind its claims of national security. An inquest is the least that a family should expect. It should not be subjected to a political veto, or indeed a negotiating ploy. Does the Taoiseach accept that the funds should be released immediately to the Lord Chief Justice to proceed with his five-year plan to deal with the backlog of legacy inquests? Does the Taoiseach accept that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the British Government has a responsibility for delivering on equality and rights protections in the North and that thus far it has failed to do so? The issue of An Gaeilge and Acht na Gaeilge is a case in point. Will the Taoiseach report to the Dáil on his approach to the negotiations and his expectations for them with only days to go? The Taoiseach indicated in the United States last week that his future as Taoiseach was dependent on the Northern talks and the EU's decision on Brexit. Will he clarify what this means? What is his timeframe for the talks in Belfast?

They are belied by the actual policies implemented in these areas. I will quote the better society section of the Taoiseach's document, "We will seek to ensure that the position of vulnerable groups in society is taken into account." It continues, "There will be a focus on providing a safe and supportive environment for children, families and older people, including through reforms in the areas of housing." Let us test those noble aspirations against the human reality. I am dealing with the case of a young mother called Sinéad at the moment, who has a four year old child. There is a history of abuse in the background of the family. They are very vulnerable, and Sinéad is terrified for her four year old daughter. She is homeless. She has been told, as part of a new policy, that she cannot stay in hotel accommodation in Dún Laoghaire near a supportive family network, but must instead go into a hostel 11 km away, in Francis Street, over a pub. How is she supposed to get her child to school? This is a policy that has been set down by the Minister because he has to meet a target of getting everybody out of hotel accommodation.Therefore she cannot stay in a hotel in Dún Laoghaire near her family, but it is okay to put her in a hostel over a pub in Francis Street, 11 km away. A year ago, Amanda got a HAP scheme housing placement, which was the Government's big solution. One year later the landlord pulls out of the HAP scheme. In my naivety, I thought that under the HAP scheme, the council had an obligation to find her something else. That is not so, however. Amanda has been told to take her three young children under the age of three into a hostel in Dublin city centre, 11 km or 12 km away from where they go to school. Is that the supportive environment for families, including children, that was promised in the document?

It is quite woolly in nature with very few tangible and firm commitments, deadlines or action points. It sets out six priorities which no one could argue with, although one could certainly add more. The one I want to focus on is Brexit, which is priority (e). There is reference to a workforce planning report in quarter one of this year. Given that his Department is taking the lead role in respect of Brexit, can the Taoiseach confirm what resources are now available in that Department to deal with the Brexit challenge? It would be useful if he could outline that to the House. I would be the first to admit that I do not know a huge amount about the parliamentary liaison unit. The Taoiseach has said that it relates to the interaction between Government and the Independent members of the Government. Is it focused solely on the interaction with the latter members of Government, or does it also involve interaction with Independent Members of the Opposition who may or may not support the Government? In practical terms, what does that liaison unit do?

Deputy McGrath put it succinctly in describing it as a harmless document. Brexit is listed in the strategic priorities but among a group of (a) to (f), including planning for the future and a better society. Specifically, however, Brexit does not get a mention in the core work activities of the Department, which are listed in the document. The last four pages of the document are simply a rehash of the programme for Government's commitments. The document is harmless but does not seem to lay out in clear terms what the Department of the Taoiseach is doing in this regard. Is it still the Taoiseach's view that his Department should be like a Cabinet office driving the heart of Government on the issues that are of most importance to the country?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	166	First of all, Deputy McDonald made a couple of points about the statement of strategy in the areas of water, mental health, energy and Northern Ireland political institutions. Obviously, the Department of the Taoiseach is central to all these Departments in the way that outcomes are achieved. I chair the Cabinet committee meetings which deal with many of these issues where the relevant personnel from different Departments and agencies appear before Government and report on progress made, or otherwise. These matters are published on a regular basis, as the Deputy knows. In America, I said there were two overriding priorities on my return. One is the setting up of an Executive in Northern Ireland. The second is to deal with the clarification that we now have on the negotiating stance of this country in respect of our participation as a European Union negotiator arising from Brexit. It is true that the two major parties in Northern Ireland, the DUP and Sinn Féin, have a principal responsibility to put together a functioning Executive for Northern Ireland, including all the communities and people there. That is something that I cannot impose on them, but I made it clear to Prime Minister May that we would not want to see in any circumstances a return to direct rule. Therefore, the options are limited. One either sets up the Executive within three weeks or not. If not, the Secretary of State can call fresh elections, introduce legislation to grant a further period of time, or else direct rule will be reimposed. If the latter is out, what is one left with? The first is a functioning Executive, which I hope can happen and which I have to be optimistic about. The second is further elections and the third is some further extension of time. I do hope that given these circumstances and in the knowledge that Article 50 will be moved, the politicians will get together, put the Executive in place, decide on a First Minister and deputy First Minister and get on with that particular business. I have pointed out those two priorities which are really important. In respect of the facilities for Brexit, I can send Deputy McGrath some further information about this. There is a dedicated unit in the Department of the Taoiseach under a new second Secretary General. It works well with the European affairs section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, is the liaison person between both of those. If necessary, we will have an opportunity to call in specialist services or personnel who might be required for particular issues. As we now prepare our response and contribution to the EU negotiating stance, that is a matter we will continue to re-examine. There has been a great deal of background work in preparation for all the options. I will not go into the details but I can furnish the Deputies with the numbers involved and refer to the opportunity to bring in specialist personnel if we need them.

The Deputy asked about Sinéad and Amanda. I would ask him to give the details to the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy English. I am not accusing the Deputy of being incorrect but it appears strange that a single mother would be asked to go with her child 11 km away to a different local authority area.

I met the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, on the margins of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday, 9 March. We discussed the Northern Ireland Assembly election results and the implications that Brexit will have for the North and for relationships across these islands. We reiterated our joint and continuing commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions and our shared desire to see a fully functioning Executive back in place within the required three-week period. The absence of political leadership in Northern Ireland is regrettable at this particularly critical time and in that regard, we welcomed the engagement by the political parties in Northern Ireland with Secretary of State Brokenshire and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and hoped that these channels of communication would remain open. I emphasised to the Prime Minister the importance of finding a way forward on outstanding commitments, in particular, on issues like the legacy institutions under the Stormont House Agreement, and the Irish language.  The Prime Minister confirmed she would trigger Article 50 before the end of the month. We now know the date of that. We discussed the enormous challenges that Brexit presents for Northern Ireland and the peace process. We are agreed on the importance of our two Governments working together to ensure that the framework of the Good Friday Agreement and successor agreements is fully preserved in the upcoming Brexit negotiations and outcomes. We both reaffirmed our commitment to maintaining the common travel area and the need to find a solution that would preserve the common travel area and also maintain a seamless Border on the island of Ireland. Following the outcome of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, spoke with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and a number of the main party leaders in Northern Ireland. The Minister and Secretary of State Brokenshire have been engaged in talks with party leaders to encourage them to play their part in creating the conditions that allow for the formation of a new power-sharing Assembly and Executive.The heart of the Good Friday Agreement is its interlocking political institutions. However, they can only be sustained on the basis of partnership, equality and mutual respect.  As a co-guarantor, the Irish Government is determined to uphold the principles of the Agreement and to protect its institutions. In the coming weeks, we will work with all concerned to see the power-sharing Assembly and Executive restored to effective and harmonious operation.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	179	I thank the Taoiseach for his response. Dealing with the Assembly elections and the efforts to put a new Executive in place in Northern Ireland, can the Taoiseach outline to the House how he sees that happening? I think we all agree that fresh elections or a return to direct rule are not desirable or acceptable options. I do not see how they would advance the peace process and bring about the stability that is required for the peace process to continue to flourish. If it is Sinn Féin's position that it will not accept Arlene Foster as First Minister pending the outcome of the investigation into the cash-for-ash scandal, and she has not acknowledged or accepted that position, then how will that circle be squared? What initiatives are the Taoiseach proposing with Prime Minister May to break the impasse? There is a very serious impasse there which needs to be resolved. On the issue of Brexit, which the Taoiseach also discussed with the Prime Minister on 9 March, did he raise with her the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland's statement that there should not be any special status for Northern Ireland as a result of these negotiations? It is difficult to see how we are to achieve our objectives of free movement of people, goods and services and of a seamless Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if there cannot be some special status recognised for Northern Ireland. How can Ireland achieve all of those objectives while the UK leaves the European Union and potentially leaves the customs union?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	180	I agree entirely with the view, as I think everybody in this House does, that we need to have a functioning Executive back in Northern Ireland. We certainly do not need either another round of elections or the imposition of direct rule. We must find a path that avoids those two outcomes. We are all reflecting on the death of Martin McGuinness today. How, in the Taoiseach's view, will that impact on the timeline that is available to the parties in Northern Ireland? Does he think that the timeline should be extended, because there will be a process of genuine grieving involved to which space must be given and that process will impact on a deadline that says things have to be done by next Monday? Has the Taoiseach had those discussions with Secretary of State Brokenshire, whom, I have been informed by Deputy McDonald, has the authority to extend the timeframe without any legislative action other than his own? I take it the Taoiseach has raised directly with the Prime Minister the Irish Government's views on the specific issues and impasses that there are, such as the Irish language Bill and the bill of rights. He has set out the Irish position in regard to that? Will the Taoiseach reiterate that for the House? How is the issue of legacy payments, in terms of costs that will arise post-Brexit for Northern Ireland, to be met? We understand that all these things have been raised by the Irish Government but it is important that the Taoiseach puts them on the record of the House. My final question is in regard to the need for a special status. We have set out repeatedly in discussions here the unique situation on the island of Ireland. I am very concerned, and the more discussions I have with my European colleagues the more concerned I become, that Ireland will end up as collateral damage of the clear view that is emerging within Europe that the primacy of holding the entity that is the European Union together is so important that all other considerations are lesser, and that, whatever words are being used now, the specific requirements of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the island of Ireland, will be pushed aside in that regard.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	181	The Taoiseach has said repeatedly today that it is the role and responsibility of the two large parties to get the Executive up and running. We know that. I want to unburden the Taoiseach of any need he might feel to keep repeating that. I want to remind him that in order for us to do that we have to have delivery of those things that were agreed. That means the DUP, Sinn Féin and the others parties putting their shoulders to the wheel. It also relies upon the Governments delivering. We do not have the scope here for me to go through the matter point-by-point and issue-by-issue, but let me remind the Taoiseach that it is an intergovernmental responsibility to ensure the delivery of equality provisions. It says so in the agreements. It was the Governments who took on, at an intergovernmental level, to deliver Acht na Gaeilge. It is the British Government that is blocking dealing with the issues of legacy. The Taoiseach and his officials are well aware of this. The question that then arises is what pressure, leverage, contact and diplomacy can the Taoiseach deploy to move the British system and, alongside the DUP, to actually deliver? That is what we are looking for. If we get delivery on the agreements as agreed, we are back in business. There is no blockage from our side. On the issue of Brexit I share Deputy Howlin's concern. We are sleepwalking on these matters. I see the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy and of the Taoiseach, and the meetings and contacts that have happened. I want to acknowledge that and to commend it, but I think on the core essentials of needing a driving strategic position for the island, we are sleepwalking. I am increasingly alarmed that there is nearly a blasé or a laissez-faire view taken around the damage, not that might visit Ireland, but that will inevitably, unavoidably visit this country unless we attain that special status to which Deputy McGrath referred and which this House voted to support.  What moves has the Taoiseach made to secure that status? The health and durability of the Good Friday Agreement rely on the achievement of special status. Agriculture, agrifood and the smooth functioning of so many sectors of our economy rely on achieving that. I have other questions but I understand that I am out of time.

What is the role of this House when it comes to the final deal? The Prime Minister has been under huge pressure in terms of whether she would cede any vote or any call on it to the House of Commons or the House of Lords. When it comes to the end, and if, as Deputy Howlin or others have said here, it is patently a bad deal for Ireland, what are the powers of veto that we might have as one of the 27 and how would such powers be applied? Would any prospective deal be brought back to the House for consideration or is it something that would be exclusively decided within a European Council meeting and taken as a fait accompli, whatever the Taoiseach of the time decides? I believe it would be appropriate for this House to be informed every step of the way but also to ultimately have a key role in any final deal. It is going to be of such consequence and it is appropriate for us to apply all the knowledge and different views of this House before any final call is made. How will this House get that power or what role does the Taoiseach believe it will have when it comes to the end point of these talks and negotiations in two years time?

Deputy McGrath mentioned the elections that took place in Northern Ireland and the result is very clear.If I recall correctly, I think the Sinn Féin president said the priority was the establishment of the Executive over the appointment of the First Minister. An Executive arose from the Good Friday Agreement which has functioned in difficult circumstances and which, I would suggest, were more difficult than current circumstances but Deputy McDonald seems to be saying there will not be an Executive until the intergovernmental agreement is implemented. The fact of the matter is that everyday life goes on in Northern Ireland and there is a requirement for a Finance Minister, a Housing Minister, an Education Minister, an Agriculture Minister and all the Ministers who turn up at the North-South Ministerial Council. They have day-to-day work to do, so I again say to the Deputy it is a case of accepting responsibility and putting together an Executive. How are we to determine what the agreed wishes, objectives and proposals of the Executive and of the elected members representing the people of Northern Ireland are if we do not have some sense of agreement? While there were difficulties previously between the late Martin McGuinness when he was deputy First Minister and his three First Ministers, he was in a position to put forward a series of papers setting out what an agreed position for Northern Ireland was. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is talking to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, today. I accept that the death of Martin McGuinness is an unforeseen circumstance and the question of whether an extension can be given is a matter the Minister and Secretary of State Brokenshire will discuss. Obviously, nobody wants to see this breakdown leading to further elections or direct rule.  I do not accept that this country will become a pawn in the negotiations between the UK and the EU. We have already set out matters very clearly for the lead negotiator in the Barnier task force. He wants the situation in Northern Ireland dealt with as one of his three priorities. This is very important. Within that, we have agreed that there will be no return to the hard Border of the past because that brought with it sectarian violence. We have made this perfectly clear to the British Prime Minister and the British Government accepts that. We agreed at our meeting in Brussels that it should not be beyond the ingenuity and creativity of all those who have laboured long and hard to bring about a position where there is no hard border and where the situation is seamless. I have referred here previously to the issues that will now present themselves. What do we do in terms of water, energy and animal and veterinary health, which are all cross-Border issues where an all-island solution can be had? We have a unique set of circumstances here which constitute a special status. We are the only place in Europe that has a peace process, the only place in Europe where PEACE funds apply and the only place that has an international legally binding agreement lodged in the UN and backed by Europe and the US so we have a unique status. Let us build on that.  I have made it perfectly clear on quite a number of occasions that what I want to see in the negotiated outcome from a European perspective is that in respect of the wording of the Good Friday Agreement to allow and cater for the possibility of the people of Northern Ireland joining the Republic in a united Ireland at some future time by consent, the same process would apply as applied in East Germany and West Germany when the Berlin Wall came down and where there was a seamless transfer and they did not have to reapply for membership over a very long period of time. The European Council will make the final decisions based on the recommendations that will come through from the negotiating team. We sit on the European side here but want to retain our very close trading relationships with our colleagues in the UK and Northern Ireland. All the economic indicators and reports point out that the Republic and Northern Ireland would be most adversely affected by this. We are under no illusions about the scale of this challenge. It is coming at us now and we must deal with it. This is why I have offered on many occasions to have full up-to-date briefings for the leaders of the parties opposite so that they are fully acquainted with all the facts here. The triggering of Article 50 may contain some other relevant information about the principle of the closest possible relationship between the UK and the EU from hereon and what is behind it. This will consume all our time for the time ahead.

As Deputies are aware, I also held a short bilateral meeting there with the British Prime Minister, Theresa May. The European Council agenda included decisions about the President of the European Council and the European Public Prosecutor's Office and discussions on migration, jobs, growth and competitiveness, security and defence and, under external relations, the situation in the western Balkans. The European Council meeting on 9 March was followed by a meeting the next morning of the 27 EU member states without the UK. At that meeting, we discussed the future direction of Europe and the upcoming events to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. During my bilateral meeting with Prime Minister May on 9 March, we discussed the situation in Northern Ireland and agreed on the need to re-establish the power-sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. I underlined the importance of making progress regarding legacy issues. We also discussed the implications of the UK's decision to leave the EU and the need to ensure that this does not lead to the reimposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. I stressed that this presents a significant political challenge and will require a political solution. Since my meeting with Prime Minister May, the UK Government has completed its internal legal procedures and has indicated that it will trigger Article 50 on 29 March. I hope that we will now see greater clarity on the UK approach to the negotiation process, including how it is prioritising its issues, in particular, the UK's proposed approach to avoiding any reintroduction of a hard border on this island. Once Article 50 has been triggered, the other 27 EU member states, including Ireland, will discuss and agree our guidelines for the negotiations ahead. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has indicated this morning that the meeting of the 27 Heads of State and Government to finalise those guidelines will take place on 29 April. The negotiating process will no doubt be complex and lengthy. However, Ireland has been engaged in intensive preparations since well before the UK referendum last June. This has included co-ordinated analysis of all the issues across Government and extensive consultation, including through the all-island civic dialogue, as well as with a range of stakeholders. Through the Cabinet Committee on Brexit, which I chair, we have identified our particular concerns and priorities and developed our positions ahead of the negotiations. We will publish a summary version of those positions soon after Article 50 has been triggered. Our headline priorities are clear. We want to continue to facilitate trade on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Great Britain, protect the achievement of the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and maintain the common travel area. We also, of course, want to influence the future direction of the EU itself. I have highlighted and explained our particular priorities in all my meetings with my EU counterparts. Ministers have also raised them at every opportunity as part of the ongoing and intensive Government programme of engagement with EU member states and the EU institutions. I believe there is now a good understanding, including in the Barnier task force, of Ireland's unique set of circumstances relating to Brexit and a willingness to work together to address them. Returning to the European Council itself, proceedings opened on 9 March with an exchange with the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani - the first since his election to the role. The Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, then chaired a session in which the position of President of the European Council was considered. Although there was broad support for Donald Tusk's mandate to be extended, Poland had earlier proposed an alternative candidate thereby creating a unique situation in which a candidate did not have the backing of his own country. However, the 27 other member states supported Mr. Tusk and he was elected for a further two and a half year term. Unfortunately, as a result of being outvoted, the Polish Prime Minister did not formally endorse the European Council conclusions despite having no issue with the substance of the text. These were, however, adopted as the conclusions of the President of the European Council. We then took a decision to allow for the European public prosecutor's office to be established under enhanced co-operation. This is an initiative in which Ireland does not participate because of our Protocol 21 exclusion. Turning to the item on migration, the High Representative, Ms Federica Mogherini, provided an update on the current situation along the migratory routes. The progress in implementing the Malta declaration, which has a particular focus on Libya and the central Mediterranean route, was welcomed. Migration will be discussed again in greater detail at the June European Council. Ireland continues to play an active role, both within the context of the EU response and at our own initiative. With regard to resettlement, that is, refugees coming from outside the EU, 672 people have arrived in Ireland since August 2015 under the relevant strand of the Irish refugee protection programme. In terms of relocation from within the EU, 320 people have arrived and we are expecting to receive more than 1,000 by next September. Furthermore, Ireland has provided more than €70 million since 2012 in response to those affected by the Syrian crisis. We have also contributed a series of fully-crewed naval vessels to help with humanitarian search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean and these have rescued 15,621 migrants over the past two years. Mario Draghi joined the discussion for the next agenda item on jobs, growth and competitiveness. He provided an overview of the economic situation, the economic policy of the euro area, growth and unemployment. There was broad agreement that economic conditions are improving, although unemployment still remains too high and recovery remains uncertain. We welcomed the extension of the European Fund for Strategic Investments and agreed to push ahead with structural reforms. I have spoken many times in the House of the importance which we attach to the Single Market and the digital single market and I was pleased that there was agreement at the European Council to press ahead with the strategies in these areas and to review progress in June. Our discussions under this heading also addressed trade. We agreed that this remains one of the most powerful engines for growth - supporting millions of jobs and contributing to prosperity. This is a position which Ireland fully supports. We welcomed the CETA agreement with Canada and expressed our determination to push ahead with other agreements while at the same time equipping ourselves with WTO-compliant tools to tackle unfair practices. The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will address some of these issues in his address. Under security and defence, there was a stocktaking of progress since the December meeting of the European Council, when we had a substantial discussion on the issue, and taking account of the meeting of foreign and defence Ministers on 6 March, when some key issues were reviewed. These included crisis management structures in the common security and defence policy, CSDP; permanent structured co-operation, PESCO; the co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD; and developing civilian capabilities. The CSDP is designed to advance the role of the EU in crisis management and peacekeeping in support of international peace and security. We support such initiatives, particularly those in support of the UN, and take a constructive and realistic approach. Taking forward work on the crisis management structures of the CSDP has involved the establishment of a new military planning and conduct capability, MPCC, for training and capacity building missions. Our view is that an appropriately configured MPCC, supported through effective joint co-ordination, could potentially deliver more effective CSDP operations. The key objective is to better plan and organise civil and military missions so as to maximise efficiencies, delivering a comprehensive approach in EU conflict management operations in accordance with UN mandates. Permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, provides a mechanism whereby military crisis management capabilities can be developed by member states in support of CSDP operations. Ireland can support the development of an inclusive PESCO which delivers essential capabilities for CSDP operations in the area of international crisis management. I point out that participation in PESCO is entirely voluntary. The co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD, will focus on capability development and the potential to address shortfalls. Again, participation is voluntary. Formal proposals from the High Representative in these areas are being discussed in Council fora. We will continue to consider these proposals carefully, as well as other relevant developments, to ensure that all decisions add value to EU international peace support efforts and are grounded in the EU treaties and related protocols. The European Council also considered internal security, highlighting the need for progressing the entry and exit system and the European travel information and authorisation system, both of which are in the context of implementing the renewed EU internal security strategy for 2015 to 2020. The last item was the western Balkans. The countries in this region face many challenges, both internal and external, and ongoing reform and regional co-operation is essential. We reaffirmed our unequivocal support for the European perspective of the countries of the western Balkans. Recognising the transformative effect of enlargement and integration, we fully support the European Council's approach to the region. On Friday, 10 March, the Heads of State and Government of the 27 EU member states met to continue our discussion on the future direction of the Union in advance of our meeting later this week to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. There we will agree a declaration outlining the many achievements of the European project, the importance of our core values and how best to respond to the challenges that we face. We welcomed the White Paper recently published by the European Commission and its useful outlining of a range of possible future scenarios for the EU. From our point of view, l have been clear throughout this debate that our core European values are central to our future peace and prosperity, that we need to remain united and that we must continue to focus on where we can work together and add value. I have stressed the need to press ahead, in particular in relation to jobs, growth and investment. Two concrete examples of where this should happen are the Single Market and the digital single market. Brexit did not feature on the agenda of the meetings. However, once Prime Minister May has formally triggered Article 50 on 29 March, Brexit will be the focus of discussion among the 27. As I noted, the next meeting to agree the guidelines will take place on 29 April. As I also noted, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will address some of the economic points in more detail in his concluding remarks.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	195	This week the leaders of Europe will gather in Rome to mark the founding event of what is known today as the European Union. In the face of enormous opposition from the far right and far left, the nations of Europe built a community defined by peace and rises in standards of living unmatched in any other period. It remains a flawed entity, but its achievements can only be denied by those committed more to their ideological purity than to recognising the facts. Yet this is not a moment for celebration. Europe and the European Union continue to face grave threats, both from those within, who demand a return to a past of competing nation states, and those outside its borders, who feel threatened by respect for democracy and human rights. Just as with the Austrian presidential election, the Dutch election has confirmed yet again that the only way to deal with extremism is to confront it. The core values of Europe, so derided by its enemies, are strong and will continue to resonate with the people if those who believe in liberal democracy are willing to speak up and defend those values. I congratulate our ALDE colleagues in the Netherlands on their successful campaigns and the fact that the liberal block emerged the strongest. The Volkspartij voor Brijheid en Democratie, VVD, and Democraten 66, D66, did the cause of democracy and co-operation a great service. The anti-EU alliance between the extremes certainly involves some different arguments. The right says that destroying the EU will enable a radical free trade agenda and reduce labour market regulation. The left says that destroying the EU will enable a radical anti-free trade agenda and increase labour market regulation. To the anti-EU parties there is almost no problem that cannot be blamed on Brussels and they are relentless in their promotion of this approach, even when, like for one party, a 40 year record of attacking the EU on every issue is now combined with a tactical support of membership. This is the first known case in history of politicians condemning a club as a militaristic monstrosity while angrily demanding to be in it. There is no better demonstration of what happens when this corrosive anti-EU rhetoric is allowed to fester than the situation in Britain. For years an increasingly hysterical anti-EU sentiment was allowed to develop, with the EU being the all-purpose whipping boy for those who longed nostalgically for some bygone era of national greatness. It culminated in an ugly, dishonest and at times sinister campaign which won a narrow majority for leaving the EU. Nine months later, the Government in London and the people who most actively sought this result have not produced a single piece of paper demonstrating any clear outcome from this decision. In case anyone is fooled by the rhetoric claiming how the economy is going fine, the facts show that deep, long-term damage is under way. A massive decline in the value of sterling and dramatic interventions by the Bank of England have given a short-term injection to the UK economy, but inflation is on its way up and many sectors of the economy have begun to slow. Borrowing is up, social spending is down and a future of radical free trade and loose regulation is being lined up. For those on the left, like our own People Before Profit and some Independents, who supported the Tory right in their Brexit push, the reality is that they have shown common cause with policies which will do deep and permanent damage to the interests of the weakest in society. They will deny this, but the hard facts speak louder. The declaration to be issued in Rome is, quite frankly, of no great importance.The draft does not and cannot do more than provide a broad statement of intent, whereas specific actions are now required. Within days of the Rome event, we will begin a two-year period of negotiations where the stakes for Ireland could not be higher. The all-Ireland dialogue confirmed the very real fears of businesses and communities on both sides of the Border about what will happen to them in the years after Brexit. For some, these fears are already being realised. Brexit throws a grenade into the middle of a system of mutual relations which has delivered much and could deliver much more if the potential of North-South co-operation were realised. At the start of the negotiations, the only honest assessment is that the London Government is a major obstacle to mitigating the most appalling impacts of Brexit on this island. From soon after the new Cabinet took up office, its behaviour has been unhelpful. It took months before confirming fundamental points and it has taken a hardline approach to the substance of the negotiations, albeit often using a pleasant tone. Thus far, prejudice against the European Union has triumphed. Irrespective of the assurances given during the referendum on maintaining access to the Single Market and customs union, it appears the British Government's dismissiveness of the European Court of Justice has become so consuming that excluding the court from any role in EU-UK relations has become a defining issue. As such, most reasonable transitory arrangements may become impossible.  On the issue of the so-called divorce elements of the talks, it is not sustainable for London to claim the right to walk away from financial commitments it played a full role in contracting. While the figure will certainly not be anywhere near that being briefed by Brussels, it will be significant. If the hardline position being briefed from Whitehall is maintained, it will reinforce the need for Ireland to be prepared for the worst possible outcome from these negotiations. A chaotic hard Brexit is entirely possible. The ESRI has predicted that such a scenario would almost immediately reduce growth, increase unemployment and squeeze public finances in the Republic. It remains the Fianna Fáil Party's position that the Government must demonstrate that it has contingencies in place for such an outcome. There was, however, no evidence of this in the recent budget.  For Ireland, the negotiations are complex and must be approached in the context of three fundamental concerns, namely, North-South relations, Irish-British relations and ongoing relations with the European Union. Many warm words have been spoken but no concrete substance provided on how to protect North-South economic and social relations. As we saw again last week, London has taken the approach of listening intensely before ignoring the concerns of the devolved administrations. The so-called great repeal Bill is likely to be a vehicle for taking power from Brussels and consolidating it in London. There is something unsettling in people talking about how much they value the devolved administrations and then refusing to concede anything to them. This is being taken by many in the non-English administrations as condescension. Concerns in respect of Northern Ireland will not be addressed by some technological solution which speeds up traffic at the Border. The reality of a customs border and the absence of guarantees provided by the Single Market will be still harsh no matter how seamless new regulations may prove to be. It remains the case that a form of special status for Northern Ireland and the counties with the deepest interconnection with Northern Ireland is the only way to mitigate the worst impact of Brexit. Free trade zones or special economic zones are common throughout the world. There are options available which would remove the impact of trade barriers on interlinked supply chains. To take one very small example, the need to obtain a transit international routier, TIR, card every time a Donegal business exports through Derry would be an absurd imposition which could be avoided with a special status arrangement. These things can happen, however, only if someone first asks for them but it has been established that London is not seeking any special deal for Northern Ireland or part thereof. The common travel area and barrier-free borders are essential but they cannot be the limit of what we are pushing for. The uniform message from Brussels is that Ireland needs to be more assertive in proposing solutions, rather than simply pointing to problems. In this context, we must state forcefully to London that it is taking Northern Ireland down a destructive path. Irish-British relations are already changing profoundly. A worrying development has been that London is increasingly adopting a spirit of unilateralism. The worst example of this is in respect of Northern Ireland, with British ministers repeatedly refusing to give a basic assurance that no attempt will be made to change provisions of the peace settlement without full agreement. Fianna Fáil is absolutely clear that we will vote against any attempt to undermine the principles which underpin the settlement, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement, subsequent agreements and the Northern Ireland Act. To prevent further drift to unilateralism by London we should seek the creation of a formal and permanent structure for Dublin-London dialogue and agreement. The absence of ongoing meetings in the context of the European Union must be addressed. Ireland is short-handed, as we simply do not have a sufficient number of people working in our diplomatic service or in dedicated Europe focused roles. While we are making more visits, we lack a sufficiently large presence to be fully on top of a large and complex negotiation and to have our voice heard in a future European Union where we no longer have one of our closest allies on many issues over many years. This short series of statements does not provide the opportunity to delve fully into Brexit issues. Once the Article 50 process has been triggered and President Tusk has sent his response on behalf of the Council, we should hold a full debate in the House on negotiating terms before the Taoiseach attends the subsequent summit.

Deputies will be aware of where he is and what he is doing. The issue of Brexit has been raised by Deputies in this debate and during Oral Questions earlier. We were repeatedly informed that the most recent meeting of the European Council would project an image of unity among member states ahead of the Brexit negotiations and the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome. The meeting was, however, coloured by the Polish Government's attempt to remove Donald Tusk as the President of the European Council. When it failed to stop Mr. Tusk's re-election Poland blocked the Council conclusions from being unanimously agreed. This dispute overshadowed the rather rosy picture of the European Union the governments of member states wanted to paint. Not surprisingly, therefore, the conclusions of the meeting released by President Tusk's office did not refer to Brexit.  The Taoiseach held a bilateral meeting with the British Prime Minister and we now know precisely when the British Government plans to trigger Article 50, namely, on 29 March. Against all sense and democratic reason, the British Government is persisting with its plan to impose Brexit on Ireland. Its determination to impose Brexit on the North despite the vote of its population underlines the undemocratic nature of partition and the unequal relationship between London and Belfast. The clock is ticking on this issue.  We must act urgently and decisively by standing up for the national interest at European level to secure special designated status for the North within the European Union in the context of the Good Friday Agreement. This is the only logical way to avoid a hard economic Border, job losses and business closures. It is also the demand of the Oireachtas following the passage of Sinn Féin's motion on Brexit calling for such status. We must also address major economic issues such as securing a relaxation of the fiscal rules to enable Ireland to adequately respond to the damage Brexit will inevitably do. We need capital investment to upgrade the road network and other transport infrastructure, including external transport hubs such as ports and airports. Will the Minister of State confirm that the Taoiseach discussed with the British Prime Minister the issue of providing special status for the North? The Taoiseach was asked a specific question on this issue but it remains unclear as to whether he raised the matter at the meeting. Will the Government press to have special status and other issues that have been raised with EU governments addressed before 29 March? This Saturday, EU Heads of State will meet to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. During this ceremonial summit, it is reported that the leaders will recommit their vow to European integration in a short political declaration but, again, this anniversary is not the time for celebrations or another excuse for the status quo to continue. The EU needs to begin fundamental change if people are to have any faith in it. Further erosion of the national sovereignty of member states is clearly not the answer and we cannot move towards a more neoliberal, centralised Europe at the expense of ordinary people who, in many cases, cannot even put food on the table or maintain a roof over their heads. If there is to be meaningful change, the Union needs to step up and prioritise public investment in infrastructure, health, housing and building the real economy. We also need democratic and transparent accountability over the European institutions and the euro. Rather than putting a sticking plaster on the huge cracks and faults within the EU and simply looking back at the signing of the Treaty of Rome, leaders need to look forward and begin the fundamental task of fixing the problems that are evident for all to see. What is certainly not required is the increasing transfer of sovereign powers to Brussels. The EU needs to adopt a new approach and begin to use its vast array of powers to deliver the positive change for European citizens within its remit and, where possible, appropriately help member states. We need to build a progressive, prosperous and social Europe which respects sovereignty, a Europe that does not express meaningless drivel and vague notions of solidarity and support but implements policies that will build and support a real inclusive Europe. I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach but he has left. Perhaps the Minister of State can address them. An Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa, has been detained in Egypt for more than three and a half years without trial. Was his case raised with our European counterparts at the Council meeting, which we repeatedly asked for in this Chamber? Ibrahim has been charged as part of a sinister mass trial, which has collapsed and been postponed 19 times. Let us be honest and forthright. He has no chance of receiving a fair and just trial. Ibrahim has been moved to a prison hospital because of his failing health. He is receiving glucose injections for critically low blood sugar levels and he is confined to a wheelchair. My colleague, Lynn Boylan MEP, best summed it up when she described his spirit as being finally broken. His condition has deteriorated rapidly after embarking on his latest hunger strike. It is time for direct intervention by the Government to save the life of its citizen. We asked the Taoiseach to push for a presidential decree and he belatedly agreed to do that. We also called on him to seek Ibrahim's release under a youth amnesty. To date, 285 young prisoners have been released by President al-Sisi under the amnesty, yet Ibrahim has not been one of them. His family and many of his friends and those who went to school with him who have been in touch with my office are asking why he has not been released under the amnesty. That is a fair question and if the Minister of State has some answers for us, we would be delighted to hear them. Has the Government examined taking a legal case against Egypt in the International Court of Justice? If not, will the Minister of State consider doing so? Will the Government seek the support of other member states in the case of this Irish and EU citizen? A new report of the UN's economic and social commission launched last week rightly accused Israel of being an apartheid state. The report is a detailed analysis of Israeli legislation, policies and practices that enable the country to operate an apartheid regime that dominates the Palestinian people as a whole, which is a crime against humanity under customary international law and the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. This is not a surprise to any of us but it is laid bare in this report for the world to see. However, again, many refuse to act with courage and challenge Israel. The EU and the Government refuse to face the reality of Israeli apartheid and challenge it. Additionally, under new legislation, the Israeli Government is now banning people who advocate for boycotts of Israel or Israeli settlements from entering the country, which prevents them from transiting to Palestine. Last week, Mr. Hugh Lanning, the chairman of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Britain, was deported from Israel under this law. Will the Government make clear to the Israeli authorities that it is not acceptable for it to ban entry of Irish citizens who advocate for the human rights of the Palestinian people and protest against apartheid politics that violate those rights? Will it take up that challenge and sanction Israel for its international human rights violations? Will it enact the human rights clause of the EU-Israel Association Agreement and suspend the agreement? When will the Government finally recognise the state of Palestine?

I hope we can have a meaningful debate on Brexit before the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, sends her letter to the Commission next week. It is important that we have an opportunity to have a debate, and not simply statements. The EU Council did not discuss Brexit and, therefore, it is not proper for us to raise it, although everybody who has contributed to the debate so far has referred to it. It is not the proper forum and ten minutes is not enough time. We have used Taoiseach's Questions, as we did earlier, to tease out what is happening on a day-to-day basis to ensure the one island that will be uniquely impacted by Brexit is protected in so far as possible by the unwelcome exit of the UK from the EU. Will the Ceann Comhairle, as chairman of the Business Committee, make sure we have such a debate? I have met scores of politicians from Britain and across Europe and everybody says positively that the unique situation in Ireland is understood but my fear is that while that is all well and good, when we dig down, it is clear that the overarching objective of the remaining 27 member states, which I have stated on the record previously, particularly the core members such as Germany and France, is the preservation of the "European project", as they call it. It has been at the heart of German political thinking and policy since the Second World War. Whatever they say, they are willing to impact negatively on their own economy. They will take whatever measures they need to ensure the viability and sustainability of the European project even it is damaging to their own interests, never mind our interests. To put it in its crudest sense, their objective is to ensure the position of the UK post-Brexit is demonstrably inferior to the status quo. Pour encourager les autres is part of it but they want to make it crystal clear that this will be the result of exiting the Union.That position is one that poses remarkable dangers for us. We will have collateral damage in that, whatever goodwill there is for us.  I will take the few minutes I have to talk about the subject matter about which we are supposed to be talking, the last European Council meeting. At the very top of the pile of the conclusions was the reappointment of President Donald Tusk in his role as President of the Council for the next two and a half years. There was speculation that our own Taoiseach might have sought that role as his next migration and may have been disappointed that he will have to stay on a little longer in his current role. He certainly seems to have recalibrated the longevity of his current position.

I have great respect for Donald Tusk but it is a problematic decision. It is not good that the European People's Party now holds the presidency of the European Council, the presidency of the European Parliament and the presidency of the European Commission. That never has been the position in the past. There has been always an understanding that there is a shared politics at European level. Perhaps the EPP regard it as a great outcome for its own political family but the diversity of political views within the institutions of the Union has been one of its great strengths. It is a great pity that, at this particular juncture, when we are looking at existential issues regarding the future of the Union, that tradition has been breached. From talking to my European socialist colleagues, I am aware it is a matter that has caused significant concerns not only among the socialist groupings but other political groupings. It is not helpful in building the sort of cross-political views of the centre-right and centre-left that are required to maintain a realistic future for the European Union based on the principles of its founding fathers and mothers. I am glad the European Council will look again later in the year at the criteria and balances needed in this process and I look forward to debating that point more fully at another time. In advance of the European Council meeting, concerns were raised about trade policies and one of the issues discussed was the CETA decision. The implementation of CETA without any Dáil vote is a matter of concern to many people here. I am a great supporter of trade agreements but there must be democratic accountability. There are real concerns now among many people who have not delved into the minutiae of these trade agreements that they impact negatively on working people. We need to have trade agreements; they are essential for the prosperity and well-being of this country but they also need to be fully ventilated and examined. The fears and concerns of working people, and trade unionists in particular, and of the environmental lobby have to be fully explained and met. Therefore, the notion that we can acquiesce to trade agreements such as CETA without a completely full debate here is something with which I do not agree. The other House has already debated this matter. Does the Government share the views that were expressed in Seanad Éireann that there should be full democratic accountability on these matters here? As the European Council statement makes clear, the leaders look forward to its imminent provisional application. Will the Minister of State clarify whether the views expressed by the Seanad have been taken into account in the Irish position as expressed by the Council? I want to mention two other matters very briefly, one of which is the banking union. The leaders reiterated the need to complete the banking union at the last European Council meeting and emphasised the importance of international co-operation on the design of common, prudential and supervisory standards for financial services. Financial services is an area that has come very much into our focus here. The Government is working hard to attract other major financial players into this State but we want to ensure we do not become a haven for financial activities and that there is very robust financial oversight. It should be done on a common basis that is agreed across the Union. This is a matter of particular importance but I do not have time to go into it in any great detail. I will mention one final issue, the issue of migration. The Maltese Prime Minister, Mr. Muscat, reported on progress in implementing the 3 February agreement which focuses on the central Mediterranean corridor. We are very familiar with this as a result of the exemplary work of the Irish Naval Service in rescuing thousands of individuals. We see the horror of thousands more unfortunately dying trying to make that crossing. I will use this opportunity to say the Naval Service personnel involved in Operation Pontus are due an allowance which has not yet been paid. It is a scandal that the people we praise and laud are left in that position. I want to raise the issue of the eastern route and the friction that has emerged between Turkey and some member states. Very vocal, loud and discordant language is being used by both sides, particularly in the Netherlands, Germany and Austria. The Netherlands has been the most discordant. We in the EU have put most, if not all, of our eggs in the Turkey basket in terms of stemming the flow of migrants into Europe. Very strong views have been expressed in this House on that matter. Why was that matter not discussed in the migration discussions? If it was, why has it not been referenced in the conclusions of the Council?  Ten minutes is an impossibly short time to deal with a matter like this but I hope we will have a formal debate with questions and answers and a clearer understanding of our position on Brexit before next Wednesday. 
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	202	I will speak for Solidarity and for the Socialist Party which organises North and South on this island and has sister socialist organisations across the world, including in Britain. I want to bring a distinctly left, progressive and explicitly pro-working class and pro-migrant perspective to this debate on Brexit. In practice, that means recognising all the key negotiating stakeholders in the Brexit process - the Tories, the devolved governments in the UK, the EU leaders and the Government in this country - are first and foremost concerned with serving the interest of big business within their own borders and furthering an international race to the bottom. To quote Jeremy Corbyn, the Tories and the employers in the UK are looking to create a "bargain basement" Britain. The competitive edge they seek following the repeal Bill due to be passed in Westminster will lay the legal ground for undoing whatever EU directives they want. For them, it is an opportunity to push back the minimum provisions which cover standards of workers' rights. Specifically the organisation of working time Acts, the transfer of undertakings laws, and health and safety in the workplace related directives are in their sights. There is an onus on the left and the trade union movement in Britain and Northern Ireland to proactively fight to retain and improve workers' rights and conditions. My comrades there will not be found wanting in that regard. The left and the trade union movement in Britain and Northern Ireland need to go further than adopting a purely defensive position. The so-called repatriation - in reality, transference - of every negative European Court of Justice ruling, from the point of view of workers' rights and EU state aid rules, and every other neoliberal measure which will no longer have the status and weight of European law behind them represents an opportunity to advance a positive programme of enhancing workers' rights as well as public investments in jobs and services.In this State, we take the consistent position of supporting the free movement of people and opposing racist border controls in the EU. That applies to the North-South Border as much as it does to the Mediterranean. Establishment politicians and employer organisations in this State are not ones to waste a good crisis. They are disturbed by Brexit, but not too disturbed by what it means for workers' rights and migrants in the UK other than how it represents a furthering of the race to the bottom. The natural reflex of the Government and IBEC is to go even further and cite developments in the UK as grounds for withholding wages in the public and private sectors and lowering the corporation tax rate, with everything that goes with that in terms of the heavy price our public services pay. In the negotiations on the terms of Brexit, we are already witnessing the nauseating sight of the rights and livelihoods of people being used as bargaining chips. We stand for the protection of the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and Northern Ireland. Their right to remain, work, vote and access public services must be supported. Conversely, we will stand against any vindictive approach taken by the EU against citizens from Britain and the North living in the EU. My colleague, Deputy Coppinger's Bill to extend the franchise will safeguard the voting rights of people from Britain and the North who are living in Ireland. I note the failure of Geert Wilders's Party for Freedom to make a breakthrough in last week's Dutch elections. His is a far right, populist party that is racist to the core. It had 20 seats in the previous Parliament. Despite predictions that it could double that number to 40 and kickstart a swing to the extreme right in the Netherlands, France and Germany, it stayed stuck on 20 seats after last week's elections. Many ordinary working people in the Netherlands voted for other options - Christian democrats, the non-government liberals, the GreenLeft and so on - but that was no thanks to the Dutch Labour Party, which left a large space open, one that Geert Wilders was fortunately unable to exploit, by selling out on workers' aspirations in a coalition government of harsh austerity. That party dropped from 38 seats to nine, a defeat on a par with the Irish Labour Party in February 2016. To defeat the far right decisively, we need a genuine, mass, left force to rally discontent and channel it in a positive direction against the establishment and capitalism, not just in the Netherlands, but in France, Germany, Ireland and other European countries.

Something that depresses me about the frightening rise of the far right and the openly racist - in some cases, openly neo-fascist - organisations is the poverty of analysis, deep cynicism and, often, dishonesty of the political establishment in this country and across Europe when faced with the dire threat of a return to the extreme nationalist and far right politics of the 1930s that spelled such a disaster for Europe. Disappointingly, we heard that poor analysis and dishonesty expressed by Deputy Donnelly in trying to link People Before Profit to the UKIPs of this world. That is echoed by Fianna Fáil-----

We on the left are the ones who criticise Europe time and again, not because it is too generous to immigrants, but because it allowed 7,000 immigrants to die in the Mediterranean through a Fortress Europe policy and because of the despicable policy, which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have their fingerprints on, of imprisoning 4,000 people, including 1,500 children, in the abomination that is direct provision. Despite setting up and maintaining that system, which degrades young people, those parties say nothing about it. They fail to criticise Europe's racist Fortress Europe policy or its despicable deal with Turkey that forces desperate Syrian refugees back into the hands of the rotten Turkish regime, which has a despicable human rights record. Similar deals are being done with Libya and Afghanistan. In the case of the latter, Afghan asylum seekers will be deported from the EU back to Afghanistan en masse. We are the ones who speak up for the refugees. We are the ones who speak up for Ibrahim Halawa, who is rotting in an Egyptian prison and whose sisters ask why the political establishment does not do more? I will tell the House what I honestly believe - the beef deals are more important than the need to take a hard approach with the Egyptian regime.

Consider the gross levels of inequality that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have presided over and Europe has created, the high levels of homelessness and the housing crisis. It is these kinds of inequality and social injustice that provide the fuel for the rotten forces of the far right. Nor is there any reflection of the similarities between the policies of the so-called moderate centre and these extreme right forces. Is it not interesting? Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael support the race to the bottom in reducing corporate taxes on large corporations, which is one of the major contributory factors to global economic inequality. Who supports the same policy but Donald Trump, Farage and Theresa May? The only result of reducing taxes on corporations is an increase in the economic inequality that is giving rise to the far right. As such, we will not be taking lectures from a political establishment that is responsible in Europe and domestically for the rise of these forces. We are trying to offer a genuine, radical, progressive and anti-racist alternative to a failed establishment and a despicable far right.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	225	I wish to raise a couple of points, the first of which follows on from our pre-European Council statements and my reference to the increasing use of the securitisation narrative instead of a humanitarian one. The risk was that the EU would renege on, or not fully respect, our legal obligations under international laws like the Geneva Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We know of the challenges presented by the humanitarian crisis and radical terrorism, but we also know of the increasing displacement and the risks that people are taking - refugees and asylum seekers - in leaving their countries of origin because of famine, conflict or abuses of their human rights. Recent EU answers have taken the form of the migration partnership framework, which entails migration compacts, and the EU emergency trust funds. While I acknowledge the EU's role as a major contributor to development aid, there are concerns that compact funding is going to countries with serious human rights abuses. These are countries that the EU would have held at arm's length before now, but the security agenda and narrative are changing that. There are concerns that the funding necessary to meet the needs of communities in Africa will be diverted from the humanitarian line. Recent UN and NGO reports have highlighted this. According to Oxfam's February report, for example, famine had been declared in certain parts of South Sudan. On 15 March, there was a stark and frightening report from the World Food Programme about the crisis in a number of African countries that happened to be Irish Aid partner countries. Some 2.9 million in Somalia and 5.6 million in Ethiopia are at risk and need urgent humanitarian assistance.A total of 4.9 million people in South Sudan need emergency food assistance between now and April. That is 40% of the country's population. In those countries food security and malnutrition in children aged under five, pregnant women and nursing mothers is dire. Another partner country, Nigeria, reports about the extent of the malnutrition and famine in North Africa. Drought has triggered the movement of people in some of those countries. People have moved for grazing land, water and work and that has led to increasing tensions between pastoral and agropastoral communities. Much of the food insecurity and malnutrition comes from drought and we know the relationship between drought and climate change. I urge the EU and Ireland to ensure a humanitarian response is fully funded and that all efforts are made in South Sudan to put an end to the fighting. I also urge that Ireland would use its influence at both EU and UN levels to work towards securing a political solution to end the conflict there. I am a member of both the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and also the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence and Brexit and its implications have been dominating meetings. The more we hear, the more appalling is the lack of preparation and work by the "Remain" side before the referendum. It was obvious that it was taking so much for granted. There was an ignorance of the implications in so many areas. Much attention has been on economics and trade but there will also be an impact on education, culture and communities. A major gamble was taken with the Good Friday Agreement and what has been achieved in Northern Ireland. No thought was given in Britain to the implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and very few voices stressed those implications. There is uncertainty now about the impact of Brexit on borders, identity and cross-Border relationships. We all know the benefits of the open Border and the co-operation it facilitates. There are concerns due to the evidence from divided societies everywhere about the implications of Brexit on identity and cultural issues. I wish to refer to what was said by an academic who came before the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. His point was that the implications for identity and culture could be potentially more significant and dangerous in the long term than the specific economic consequences. He also highlighted the implications for health care, transport and retail. There are concerns that the funding that went to support peace and reconciliation and building cross-Border relations could be under threat. The European Convention on Human Rights is a cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement but one must ask where that stands post-Brexit. Special status for Northern Ireland is vital, as the convention forms part of the Good Friday Agreement. The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement called for a specific strand of the Brexit negotiations to deal with the protection of the Good Friday Agreement. There was also a call for a civic forum to engage civic society on the issues as they emerge. The option of a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine is fading as settlements are being built. We continue to support the two-state solution but how can we do that when we do not recognise one of the countries as a state? For some time a number of Members have raised concerns about the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, but we have not got significant or meaningful answers to our questions and there is a need for that.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	226	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, on behalf of the committee of which I am Chairman, namely, the Joint Committee on European Affairs, and acknowledge the sterling work he has done in recent months in particular due to the challenges we face with Brexit. I thank him personally and on behalf of the committee for the manner in which he has assisted us, which has been most beneficial. He has been most diligent in his duties and he takes his role very seriously. This is a critical time for us from the perspective of farming, tourism and trade. So much is on the line at present and we need people to be constructive. We do not have time for nonsense, political bickering or point scoring. I do not care whether a person is in opposition or in government. In my humble opinion, we are all wearing Irish jerseys and fighting to ensure we represent farming and other sectors to the best of our ability. This morning, I had the pleasure of meeting the Belgian ambassador and two weeks ago I welcomed the British ambassador. I find such meetings very beneficial and workmanlike. The people I meet are very pleased to come to air their views and discuss their perspective on where the European model is going in the future. It is a traumatic prospect that at the end of this month the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will trigger Article 50 and as the Minister of State well knows we will just have to get on with it. Numerous problems will face us and I very much appreciate the work the Taoiseach has been doing in recent weeks in particular on this important issue, despite other issues that have arisen. It is of vital importance that we minimise every negative effect that will come our way because 30,000 people a day cross the Border. If one takes farming alone, millions of gallons of milk come from the North every day to be processed in the South and a vast amount of it goes back to the North again to be sold. The complications that face us are of enormous proportions. I had a meeting in the past ten days with representatives of the pig sector as there are many large pig producers in the Border counties. They are terrified of what could happen as they have made significant investments to the tune of millions in their farms. The only pig farms that remain in this country are those that have invested significantly and grown in size. I met genuine people who were steeped in the pig farming tradition for decades and they are fearful of what will happen to them in the future. Now, more than ever, we need sound political leadership and for us all to come together to do everything we can. I compliment all of the members of the committee I have the privilege of chairing because they are most experienced and committed to putting their shoulder to the wheel and working with the Minister of State and others to ensure we do everything, to the very best of our ability, to represent the people who elected us. I am pleased to have had an opportunity to contribute to the debate today. I am sharing my time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	I too am pleased to speak today in the post-European Council debate. It is time we got serious because the trigger has almost been fully pulled and it only remains for the final step before Article 50 is notified to the EU on 29 March. Deputy Niamh Smyth is present and she appreciates that one could not have a hard border again let alone a soft border between the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and the Republic from the point of view of farming, especially pig farming as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae outlined, sheep farming, dairy, beef and cereals as well as industry. Farmers travel across the Border and some farmers have land on both sides of the Border. It is vital that we do all we can in that regard. I had the privilege of being in the United States last week.I met An Taoiseach at the embassy gig and in New York. There were many lieutenants on his arm supporting him and although people thought he was going somewhere, I do not think he is going anywhere. He performed his duties with a bit of panache and he was excellently received by President Trump, Vice President Pence and the Speaker of the House, Mr. Ryan. I attended those functions. We are pushing an open door in that respect. Europe has not been very kind to us, although we have been through a lot in Europe. We have been exemplary Europeans. We now need to look elsewhere as our nearest neighbours are at it again. We used to call them John Bull but they are not too interested in what we are doing here. They care little about the impact. They are self-centred, as they always were. When the British Empire was at its strongest, we struck a blow from a united Ireland that crumbled that empire. They seem to be thinking it is payback time but I do not want that either. We are certainly on our own, as far as they are concerned, so we must look at our strengths and our allies in the United States. We should not every day of the week attack the elected President of such a powerful economy until he does something that would damage us. He has not done that. I met the chief executive officer of IDA Ireland over there, as well as representatives of Enterprise Ireland and tourism groups. They are working so hard to try to send back tourists and jobs. We must consider that. We must attend the negotiations and demand of our European colleagues that they stand by us and support us. We have been exemplary Europeans. I have often criticised the process but it is now payback time. It should allow us to be in the centre of those negotiations. I know the Taoiseach will make contacts. That is in case Members think I am a party political broadcaster. We need the benefit of his expertise and experience in that area. The fewer rumblings there are in that pen, the better at this volatile time. That is in case the sheep are anxious and the dogs might be left out after them. It is too serious for that. We need our place at the table to be recognised. In mentioning migration problems, I salute the Naval Service and sympathise with the Irish Coast Guard on the tragic accident that occurred when I was away. They do tremendous work and the Naval Service has brought pride to our country because of the many life-saving efforts they have made in humanitarian causes. The migration problem has been discussed and that is ongoing. We are only scratching the surface. I thank the non-governmental organisations for the work they have done in this regard. The time for talking is gone and it is now time for decisive action. We know the UK is pulling down the shutters and leaving us adrift. We must make our own way. The old adage is that where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows, but Ireland must now lead its own way. We must make our own way and look to friends and markets elsewhere. We can look to our diaspora and recognise the work of IDA Ireland and others. I cannot believe an organisation like ConnectIreland has been disbanded as it made good headway. We need all hands on deck and we must all go the same way at the one time. There should be nobody going against the tide. We must make use of the tide and get the wind at our backs. The old saying is "Ní neart go cur le chéile". We must stand and fight together, demanding that Europe gives us payback. I suppose I should not use that word but it must support us because we have been good Europeans. The European Union should enhance the negotiations in any way it can with a view to cushioning us from the terrible impacts that face us. Everybody realises it, even in the United States. The Americans are looking at us now while carrots are being dangled by the UK to them. It will not all be one-way traffic. Our béal should be dúnta and we should recognise the elected President while working with him.

I argue his sister party in Greece, Syriza, has a real role and we need the Greek Government to row in behind our case for European Union monitoring of Ibrahim's trial process. I regret the fact I was not able to get that point across but I am glad to be able to put it on the record now. The Taoiseach said something valid earlier when he was asked questions of issues of major consequence. He stated he had to respond in one and a half minutes. I will use this occasion in a similar way, discussing some of the detailed strategy around the Brexit negotiations about to take place as discussed at the European Council. They will be discussed again at the next meeting at the end of April. I will make a couple of very basic broad points. To state the obvious, we need a deal and it would not serve our country's interests for this to fall apart. There are approximately 70 British Tory MPs living in some weird Churchillian historic world who want to bring down the process. I include in that some of their lead Ministers, such as Mr. Boris Johnson and Mr. Liam Fox, who are quite happy to get a negotiation process that breaks and sees them in some sort of pirate role that they see as a glorious trade future. It is a role around deregulation; they want a low tax and regulation of capitalism in a tooth and claw economy where they think they can do well. That would be a disaster for Europe and Ireland so we must prevent it and defeat them. They know what they are doing. It is a strategic and deliberate ploy. Unfortunately, it seems Downing Street in the way it has gone about the approach to triggering Article 50 to date is being swayed by that rump within the Tory Party. We must start thinking tactically in how we address that threat. We must come, as best we can, to some sort of deal restoring co-operation and high standards without going down the route of deregulation and low standards, which is where they want to take us. There are a couple of tactical approaches that I suggest. There is a range of difficult issues in the negotiations, particularly around the cost of the divorce bill, UK and European citizen rights in the UK and the rest of Europe, migrant rights, the Single Market, the customs union, financial passporting and the fisheries policy. There is a range of areas, largely around trade, migration and financing of the Brexit process, that will be deeply contentious. There are other areas that are less contentious and with fewer difficulties, meaning there is still potential for collaboration. To cite some examples, there is the area of environmental protection, energy co-operation and justice matters. I am going to Brussels on Thursday to speak at a conference on the issue of energy co-operation, so I look forward to getting a sense of how much potential there is for collaboration. We must take a very proactive role in those collaborative areas that are not as contentious as the really difficult trade and financial issues. From what I read about the negotiations process, I do not see the strand for collaborative issues in the negotiation process. If none exists, we should look to help create that strand because it is in our interests. Another area where collaboration is possible is digital rights, which is probably one of the more difficult issues. It is one of the more critical issues for our country because we have such a significant digital industry and we do not want the UK going down the route of having low regulation and a bargain basement approach where privacy does not matter. It could well do so. There are issues around spying and how the Government Communications Headquarters and others interact with our data. It is a particularly contentious issue for us. That would be solved by treating it not in trade negotiations but separately in a collaborative agreement around standards. We must apply the standards issue. It was interesting to see Mr. Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organization, make the point in a speech in London a few days ago that the battle is not just in whether there is a tariff but rather there are intellectual property rules, tax breaks and state aid rules. A rush to the bottom in such regulatory processes must be avoided and we must maintain proper standards in a variety of areas. As I noted, it is critical that we stand up for environmental standards and we should not see the UK going down the road of using genetically modified organisms and feedstock with steroids and antibiotics. Those environmental and social standards have been advocated by the European Union and we should look to maintain them within any negotiated settlement. I hope that through co-operation in those areas, it will be slightly easier to address some of the related customs union and trade areas. These are concerns regarding intellectual property and standards issues relating to data protection, for example.For example, in the area of energy, it is not only the physical infrastructure one has but the nitty-gritty of the winter package on whether one can get inter-day trading balancing systems for those interconnectors. It is such, to a certain extent, non-contentious issues of co-operation where we should be taking a proactive role in some collaborative spaces in the talks. My advice would be, if at all possible, get them agreed and off the table early in advance of any possible car crash towards the end. The reason I say so is because there are some in the UK Government who want that car crash. We should try to get as much agreement off the table, agreed and settled in advance before they might have to go back to the House of Commons, either blaming Europe for the process or forcing a general election. It is important that the European negotiation position on this is seen to be one that does not want to teach the British a lesson or bring it down, but that we want the best collaborative deal for both sides. It is in our interest to have the UK maintaining those high standard systems in any future post-Brexit model. It is not in our interest for them to be a loose-cannon, low-regulatory, race-to-the-bottom large state in Europe because that would provide a potential model for other populist right-wing governments across Europe which might want to follow a similar route. Ultimately, it would be deeply damaging to the economies of scale we can have and the power that Europe should bring when we have common standards around products, environmental rules and social issues. The main point I wanted to make is that in our negotiating position Ireland particularly should be driving that negotiating space around the non-contentious collaborative co-ordination issues. I do not get a sense of that happening. We should be taking a lead in Europe, in some ways, looking for that within the next European Council or within whatever approach we take within these talks. I regret, in terms of the Taoiseach's response to my question earlier, it was clear he was saying that this House will not have a vote in any final deal. If that is to be the case, we need to be involved. I accept we have talks here, we have this constant debate around Brexit, but we do not get into the weeds of it. It is difficult for us to do it in committees because this is high stakes high level negotiations happening in real time that it is difficult to interact with. I still think we should vote because the UK will probably end up having a vote as there will be a vote of confidence if there is not a decent deal. It would be ironic in the sense that we would be very much affected by whatever deal is done but we would not have a say whereas the House of Commons may in the end have one.

If we are not to have that vote - I still think we should - we need a mechanism in some of the real detailed negotiation, for example, around those less contentious energy trade deals that we might be doing. We need to involve the committees here, and involve the Dáil, because in some instances we have connections, understandings and interest in what the final points of those details are. More than anything else, it might bring us closer to what Europe should be about and what should be the sixth scenario that the Council could present in the future Europe, that is, Europe going back to what it does best, what it stands for and what it brings to the table, including its collaboration with the higher values and ideals around environmental, social and justice standards. That is what I would like to see, in some ways trying to salvage something good out of the wreckage that 70 Tory MPs have created in this whole process.

#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	232	I specifically draw the Minister of State's attention to the mandate that the Commission's task force will have. My party understands that the European Commission task force, led by Mr. Michel Barnier, will receive a mandate from the European Council after the meeting in April allowing it specifically to engage in the so-called "divorce talks". Therefore, we know that they will be prioritising the Border, a potential final settlement bill to the UK and the reciprocity of rights between EU and UK citizens. We also believe that explicitly excluded from that mandate will be the ability to negotiate the future relationship. The best understanding we have is that the task force, if it believes that the so-called "divorce settlement" is going well, will then go back to the European Council and seek a second mandate to begin informal talks. Fianna Fáil believes that is not in the best interests of Ireland. We are obviously all aware of this two-year ticking clock. We are all aware that uncertainty causes damage, regardless of the outcome. As that clock ticks closer to zero, the longer it takes for informal talks on the future relationship to happen the more uncertainty and fear there will be, the more danger there will be of an EU member state or set of EU member states deciding that it or they are not happy with how the process is working and that as a result, basically the greater the opportunity for the process to go badly wrong. What Fianna Fáil would like is for the Taoiseach and the Government to immediately begin a conversation with the Commission and for the Taoiseach to represent a view at the April Council that Mr. Barnier's task force should be explicitly given both mandates so that the divorce talks can happen at the same time as informal preliminary talks start on the future relationship. Is this something the Minister of State agrees with, that Fine Gael will consider and that the Taoiseach would bring in to those Council talks?
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	233	Many, quite rightly, would now acknowledge that those who scripted Article 50 did not envisage that any member state would be leaving. Article 50 certainly has its limitations. We now have the date from the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, as to when they will trigger Article 50. There will be two processes. It goes back to the question that Deputy Eamon Ryan asked about the vote of the Dáil. The new relationship - the trade agreement, the mixed agreement that it will be - will be put before every parliament and it could be many years before this deal is concluded. The issue of the UK leaving, the so-called "withdrawal", the Article 50 provision, is in and of itself very tight. In fact, with respect to the new relationship, it has quite a limited text with respect to a reference to the new agreement taking place in due course. The view of the European Council and of the task force takes into account the legal position. We, clearly, will be more impacted on whatever this new relationship is than anyone else - Northern Ireland perhaps more so than ourselves - and we will have an acute interest in making sure that this new relationship is as strong as possible. Equally, in order to make any progress, according to Mr. Barnier and his task force, and, indeed, the legal position, the task force will determine four areas - the issue of the two institutions, the banking authority and the medicines agency but also, crucially, from an Irish point of view, issues pertaining to Ireland, the reciprocal rights issue and the bill. They will be tackled in the first round. That is a requirement of the treaty. From our point of view, if we can secure early progress on the common travel area, there is the potential that we can advance many of our strategic concerns. As many will be aware, there will be difficulty. Much of the dialogue we have heard from London with respect to the so-called "Brexit bill" has been exceptionally unhelpful. It does not fairly reflect the fact that for 45-plus years the United Kingdom has entered into contractual agreements with the other 27 member states. What we need to focus in on is the methodology as to how a bill is arrived at but it is inaccurate, in fact unfair, to describe this amount of money as some form of punitive fine for a democratic choice that they have made. With respect to acquired rights, I hope they will follow the straightforward principle that there would be a reciprocal arrangement for UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. Clearly, at the earliest possible time, we will have to start talking in our country with our partners about the form of the new relationship.However, I am very strongly of the view that, first, it is in our interest strategically to have significant progress on the common travel area and securing our peace process. We must establish clearly that when it comes to the common travel area and the peace process, our concerns in Ireland are unique. I have been in many countries around the EU recently and the Deputy and others have visited the European institutions in the past number of weeks. As such, I note that while we have significant trade concerns, many countries share the concerns we have on trade. Denmark, for example, has a similar profile. While we will be the most affected member state, we will not be uniquely affected in some elements with respect to trade. However, the common travel area and peace are issues unique to us, which is why getting something on that early in the process is in our strategic interest. We can then deal in due course with the issue of trade. It is stark to make the statement that every member state will have a vote on the new agreement when it comes in due course. We saw what happened with the Wallonia province in Belgium with respect to CETA. I am not getting into the rights and wrongs of that determination. The question about the issue of the withdrawal is ultimately a matter for the people of the United Kingdom who seek to leave. It would not be possible for the other 27 member states to vote to stop them from leaving. The national parliaments will, rightly, have a role in determining what our new relationship will be. We have been very clear as has everybody in the House with the exception of Deputy Richard Boyd Farage sounding a rant which completely forgot that Farage, UKIP and the new Solidarity, as they are called this week, were on the same side of the argument that the UK should leave. Unfortunately for the people of the UK, this was a poor choice, but we must accept it here. Listening to everybody else who spoke today in the Dáil, I heard reasoned argument and criticism of the Government requiring us to do more in some instances, with some compliments also. That sort of populist narrative was not successful in the Netherlands last week and it has been quite damaging in the UK. We hope it will not be damaging in France and other member states. It is very unwelcome because as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs accurately said, we need to pull together. In that regard, I note to Deputies Crowe and Donnelly that the groups in the European Parliament are of huge importance to us. Deputy Howlin mentioned his socialist colleagues and the EEP group, but all the groups will have influence. I urge all Members of the House and their parties to continue to engage because this will be a collective effort.

I also asked about the Israeli situation, in particular, the banning of citizens travelling to Israel. Are we going to look at the possibility of lifting the EU-Israeli trade agreement? Many others have asked about the recognition of Palestine and received the standard answer that we are waiting for the right time. When is that right time? A question I did not ask relates to the Council conclusions which noted the need to implement the common set of proposals for enhanced co-operation with NATO and that, building on that momentum, work must be taken further with even greater determination and speed. Is it not another concrete step on the road to an EU army to work in co-operation with NATO? Why is the Irish Government supporting this? Despite its impressive-sounding name, the common security and defence policy is completely misleading. The policy will improve neither security or defence and is rather an outward looking, offensive and imperialistic project. The CSDP as currently envisaged would force Ireland to increase and maintain spending on weapons and military capabilities to 2% of GDP, which is an outrageous proposal especially when our health service is in a shambles and we have one of the worst housing and homelessness crises ever to face the State. That is apart from the contradiction it presents to Ireland's neutrality in the call for an EU army and a permanent military structure. My opposition is as much about the fact that we are continually told there is no money to invest in our public services, water infrastructure and capital infrastructure. Nevertheless, the EU wants us to spend money on militarisation. That is not my priority and it is not the priority of most people across Europe. We are being asked to increase our budget from 0.6% to 2%. It falls within the EU budgetary constraints levelled on us through the fiscal stability rules. Regardless of respecting our neutrality, why is the Government supporting these demands? Why was there no objection to this clause within the Council conclusions?

Unfortunately, I had to leave, but, if I heard him correctly, he said a collaborative space around future deals would come after the Brexit divorce negotiations. Do we have flexibility on that given that it seems to me it is not in our interests to have that long, drawn-out, uncertain process? It is not in our interests to have a broken-down deal. Is it possible for us to bring forward some of those new ballot arrangements, which can revitalise Europe in standing up for social, environmental and business standards? I was interested to hear the Minister of State intimate that those sort of arrangements would be subject to Dáil approval whereas the other Brexit arrangements might not. Can he articulate exactly how he sees that happening and if it is possible to bring those talks in to run concurrently with the more difficult divorce proceedings?

He has been moved back to prison, having spent four weeks in hospital. While this process has been entirely unsatisfactory, we believe the recent hearings in the case have, in general, been more substantive than previously. This may indicate that the trial is finally under way in earnest. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is expressing a cautious optimism that a conclusion might be in sight. This is crucially important because the Egyptian President has consistently advised, including to the House's delegation last January, that he cannot intervene and use his discretionary powers until the trial has ended. The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, had a further face to face discussion with his Egyptian counterpart last Monday week in Brussels and that Minister reiterated the consistent Egyptian line that they are anxious to resolve the matter but cannot intervene. The Irish embassy paid its latest consular visit two weeks ago on 1 March. To date, there have been 55 consular visits. We all share the very strong sense that this is entirely unsatisfactory and want the issue to be brought to a conclusion. Co-operation between NATO and the EU is necessary to ensure that their mandates are properly implemented. Those mandates are for the safety of our participating peacekeepers.We also have to be really clear that EU NATO co-operation takes places within the framework of the Lisbon treaty. This is a legally-binding, specific-to-Ireland protocol which states the treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. EU NATO co-operation does not concern us and has no implications for our triple lock which governs deployment of our military personnel outside the State. As the House is aware, these arrangements, which are set out in legislation, require that operations must be mandated by the United Nations, participation in operations must be approved by the Government and, with certain limited exceptions, they must be approved by way of resolution of the Dáil. To respond to Deputy Eamon Ryan on the new relationship, as I stated to Deputy Donnelly, the simple reality is that the people of the United Kingdom have voted to leave the European Union and the negotiations in the first instance will be to try to establish whether in four specific areas, three areas plus the issue of the two EU agencies, we can come up with agreement on the terms of its leaving. It will be absolutely crucial to have engagement with all Members of the House and members of all the political groupings. Ultimately, a vote of the House will not be able to prevent the United Kingdom leaving the European Union because it will be a majority vote of the 27 to approve the EU side of the deal, and even at that point, of course, the UK could reject the deal, leave the European Union and go to a default WTO-type arrangement or another type of arrangement. When it comes to the starting point for the new relationship, it is correct to point out that we have common concerns and energy is clearly a very strong element of any trading relationship. We see it with respect to discussions on TTIP, CTIP and Mercosur, and it is correct to say it is not just about tariffs. It is also about standards. Each of these new elements will have to be negotiated within the terms of the new relationship. An orderly process will be exceptionally challenging. Michel Barnier has specific teams dedicated to acquired rights, issues pertaining to cost and discussions on Ireland. If we can see progress in these areas over the coming six to nine months, the potential will arise for us as a House and country to start looking at what the new relationship will be. I accept at this point in time this seems quite a challenge but I hope it can be done with the background of a positive start to the process. We must be blunt with our friends in London. If we are to have a positive start, we need to see a moderate tone and moderate language, and acceptance that there needs to be goodwill on both sides. The UK has been part of the club for 28 years and there is goodwill in member states, including our own, for the people of the United Kingdom. However, it will not be helpful if some of the language of the referendum is continued in the way it paints and describes members of the European Union of which we will continue to be valued members. Someone referenced we would all be better off out of the European Union. It is absolutely vital to stress our largest trading partner by some distance, with 34% of all trade, is the European Union separate from the United Kingdom. For us to compound the difficulties we will face as a result of the UK leaving by also leaving the European Union would be absolutely catastrophic and crazy. I am glad this view is not holding any sway in the country and long may this continue. I will now address some of the issues regarding jobs, growth and competitiveness. President Draghi of the ECB joined the Heads of State and Government for the first part of their discussion. It was noted and welcomed that all member states' economies are expected to grow this year. For us as a small open trading economy, we are exposed if there is prolonged weakness in the euro area. This more positive outlook is very welcome. Growth for the European Union as a whole is predicted by the Commission in its winter forecast to come in at 1.8% and in the euro area at 1.6%. Real GDP in the euro area has grown for 15 consecutive quarters. Of course, these are headline figures and do not give the full story, and we are still aware of the acute need to prioritise jobs, particularly youth unemployment, across the continent. Nonetheless, the figures are going in the right direction. Ireland is doing better than most, with unemployment happily falling to 6.6%. However, throughout the European economy, employment is growing at a fairly robust pace and unemployment generally is, consequently, continuing to fall. Some of the measures with respect to youth unemployment are starting to bear fruit and the Commission published figures showing 1.4 million fewer young people are unemployed now than in 2013. The European Council meeting formally endorsed the annual growth survey. The Commission has presented a country report on each member state, as it does under its European semester. In Ireland's case, the assessment is again broadly positive. The report points to the decline in public debt and some diminishing elements of our financial sector challenges, and while progress is acknowledged in these areas, the report also highlights the need to resolve the legacy issues which continue to be a burden on our country, particularly non-performing loans, and the need to remain vigilant to potential external shocks - for the past two and a half hours, we have discussed the obvious one of Brexit. A number of other economic items were also dealt with. The European Council reiterated the need to complete banking union. It also called for structural reforms, such as strength in public finances and investment, including through the swift extension of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, with a particular focus on those member states with high levels of unemployment. Economic issues affect society as a whole, and in recognition of the social dimension the European Council welcomed the plan to hold a social summit, which will take place in Sweden later this year. There were two other items of particular relevance for Ireland under the jobs, growth and competitiveness heading. These were trade and the Single Market. As was clearly stated in the conclusions, trade remains one of the most powerful engines for growth throughout the continent, obviously supporting millions of jobs. We welcome the EU-Canada CETA and we also welcome the ambition to work towards other agreements with Japan, Mexico and others. Another foundation of European prosperity is the Single Market, and despite all of our progress in the Single Market, perhaps the great success story after the peace process that is the European Union, we have not yet seen the Single Market for services or the digital Single Market deliver on their potential. I hope very much the new initiative from the Commission, with its 16 measures and the 22 legislative proposals which are on the table, will address this as I believe it can. I thank all of the Deputies for their questions.

I thank both my colleagues for their questions. It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and that it maintains a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community. Members of the House will be aware from recent discussions on the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Act  2017 that An Post is entering a period of significant change in order to cope with the rapidly changing environment in which it operates. Nationally and internationally, mail and post office businesses are experiencing long-term structural challenges, with electronic substitution having a significant impact.  This trend has been evident for some years in An Post. The mail volume decline of 38% between the 2007 peak and 2015 accelerated in 2016 with An Post recording a doubling year-on-year volume decline, resulting in a serious financial impact for the company. To put this into context, every 1% decline in mail volume equates to a loss of revenue for An Post of €4 million. The impact of a 2.5% Labour Court pay recommendation last year has added further pressure to an already difficult financial situation. Reflecting the scale of employment provided by An Post, a 1% increase in pay adds €4.5 million to payroll. As soon as I became aware of the financial situation in An Post late last year, I acted swiftly to examine a number of options to assist in giving the company financial headroom. I met with the chair and CEO of An Post to discuss this matter in detail and also met other stakeholders such as ComReg and the Communications Workers' Union.  In order to stabilise the company's financials, the repeal of the price cap mechanism was identified as the only measure which could be implemented quickly.  I received Government approval in December to introduce legislation to repeal the price cap.  I am glad to acknowledge the co-operation of Deputies across all sides of the House in supporting the passage of the legislation which was enacted last week.  It is important to restate that this was not a decision that was taken lightly. NewERA had conducted an in-depth review of the company in recent months on behalf of myself and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as the shareholding Ministers, and confirmed the seriousness of the situation facing An Post. It is worth noting that stamp prices in Ireland are well below the European average and it is expected that the proposed increases will bring the price in line with European norms. The repeal of the price cap is only one of a series of measures which will be necessary to provide the financial underpinning to An Post to allow it to continue to provide mail and post office services.  Fundamental decisions are required about how the company will operate in the future, and the company has started an in-depth review to identify the best approach to the necessary restructuring, the outcome of which is expected in the next month or so.  I continue to monitor the position closely and meet regularly with the chair and chief executive of the company. I look forward to hearing the outcome of the An Post review but it would not be appropriate for me to comment further while this process is still under way. The Government is acutely aware of the value placed on daily postal deliveries by communities in both rural and urban areas and recognises the importance of ensuring that An Post has the capacity to continue to fulfil its obligations in that regard.  It is important to remember that An Post provides a high quality mail service to businesses and personal customers across the country. The mail network undertakes the delivery of 2.5 million mail items every working day to 2.1 million homes and businesses. It includes 7,620 collection, processing and delivery staff, 160 local delivery units, and four national mail centres. The company has a number of strengths such as its brand and nationwide reach. I accept that the scale of the price increase proposed is significant for both business and personal customers of An Post. While the price increase should provide additional financial headroom for the company, it is important, in the context of any restructuring proposal that management, unions and staff of the company engage in meaningful discussion in order to position An Post to meet the current and future customer requirements.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The operation of the post office network is an operational matter for An Post and not one in which I have a role.  On foot of a reconfiguration of Departments in July last year, responsibility for the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The implementation of the Kerr report and plans in relation to the network are a matter for that Department and the company.  Any decisions regarding the network of post offices will be given due consideration by all parties in the context of the overall review of the company as a whole. The Government decision of 19 July 2016 agreed, in accordance with the programme for Government, to transfer responsibility for the post office network from my Department to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As the network is an integrated business run by An Post it is not possible to disaggregate urban and rural post offices and therefore the network as a whole is transferred to that Department.  Delivery of the programme for Government commitments, in particular, implementing the report of the post office business development group and actions on post offices and Community banking will be the responsibility of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

I asked him how he plans to secure the long-term future viability of the Post Office network. The Minister has given me a couple of pages from the annual report of An Post. He has reflected on what has happened and what he has done to secure the short-term viability of the company. We have had that debate here on umpteen occasions. The fact of the matter is that for many communities, particularly for those worst affected by this Government's callous cuts of services to rural Ireland, the local post office is the most important social hub. It is the nucleus around which so much other activity is dependent, whether it is the activity of small and medium enterprises in the region or retaining the fabric of rural communities. This is, without a doubt, a period of change. Government intervention is clearly required. All I am getting from the Government side is that it is an issue for another Minister, such as the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, or the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, but not an issue for the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten. Will the Minister inform the House, and give some confidence to the people who will be affected by the changed structure that An Post is detailing, that the Government cares about those communities and is prepared to act to protect that vital service?

I am not too lifted by the response that we have received. We need decisive action and we need it quickly. An Post does not have time on its side. The 1,150 post offices around the country do not have time on their side. An Post is a trusted service. The current difficulties provide an opportunity. We need to make a move. We have been hearing talk about what should be done to broaden the number of services for years. Previous Governments of all hues have not acted decisively. We would not be where we are now if they had. We are where we are and we need to move on from that. When are services for motor tax, business rates, Government services and banking opportunities going to be rolled out? The Kerr report has been around for months. We have seen the outcome of the initial report. It needs to be grabbed. This is not something that we can play around with for another year, two years or three years. We cannot have paralysis. We combined here to pass the Bill. We took decisive action here a couple of weeks ago in support of the Government Bill, because we saw the need for it. I am saying to the Minister, and one of the problems is there are too many Ministers responsible for it, that we need decisive action on the post office network and to use its difficulties as an opportunity.

It is also important to point out, as I have pointed out here in the past, that on foot of the reconfiguration of Departments, responsibility for, and accountability to this House for, the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys. On 19 July 2016, the decision was taken by Government, in accordance with the programme for Government, to transfer responsibility for the post office network from my Department to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys' Department. The delivery of the programme for Government commitments, in particular, to implementing the report of the post office business development group, and the two groups established on foot of that - the post office hub working group and the network renewal implementation group - and the actions on the post offices and community banking are the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and her Department.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	246	The Minister has succeeded in confusing just about everybody. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, makes it very clear that his role is about looking at a group of services that could enhance activity within the post office network. He claims to have absolutely no responsibility whatsoever for the operation of the network. The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, is telling us something different.The sooner the Government comes clean and tells the people who are affected by this change who is responsible, the better. On a number of occasions the Minister told us that he has corporate responsibility for An Post. The last time I checked, however, the contract is between postmasters, who, by and large, run the post offices, with the exception of 50 or so that are owned by the company, and An Post where the Minister has effective overall corporate governance responsibility. It does not take a corporate lawyer to make the connection between the Minister's responsibilities, the effective operation of the contracts and ultimately the delivery of the service. The sooner the Minister accepts his responsibility for a holistic approach of the entire An Post entity and stops shifting responsibility between himself and a fellow Minister, the better.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	247	We have three Ministers with some level of responsibility for An Post and the post office network, which is a ludicrous situation. While I have admired the Minister for some things he has done, I have criticised him for others. I am approaching this matter constructively, however, as I know that Government Deputies are also frustrated with the situation. I am asking the three relevant Ministers to go to the Taoiseach and ask him to make one of the three of them responsible for An Post. The Minister said he is responsible for the corporate body of An Post, while his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is responsible for the network and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, is responsible for developing the smaller less viable post offices. That system cannot work, however. There can only be one Minister with one line of responsibility because all of An Post's services are meshed together. This applies to the GPO and the four mail centres, one of which is in my constituency in Portlaoise. I am respectfully asking the Minister to do so because they cannot be separated. I think the Minister is frustrated, annoyed and unhappy with this situation. A solution has to be found, so I ask the three Ministers to go to the Taoiseach to sort out who is responsible.

When the issues concerning An Post were brought to my attention, I did just that. The reality is that a decision was taken on 19 July by the Government to transfer responsibility for the post office network to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and her Department. Naturally enough, as a Deputy from a rural constituency, I know the impact this issue is having on the post office network. I have a huge personal interest in this matter and I have been involved in discussions on it with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to see how the Government can acknowledge the fact that the post office network is a government network. There is a responsibility on all Ministers to put work through that network which would sustain the maximum possible number of post offices. As Deputies have said, there is an opportunity here to maximise the retention of the network if every Minister takes responsibility and examines how we can improve efficiency within our own Departments and put work through the post office network. When the Kerr report sought submissions, I made a submission as a Deputy which I believe still stands today.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	250	I wish to ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment about his plans to speed up the roll-out of the national broadband plan; if there is a timeframe on the urgent points identified in the implementation programme on the mobile phone and broadband access document; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	251	The national broadband plan, NBP, aims to deliver high-speed broadband to all businesses and households in Ireland through a combination of commercial investment and State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated. The NBP has been a catalyst for an increased level of investment by commercial operators.  Since the publication of the NBP, investment by the commercial telecommunications sector has been considerable with over €2.5 billion spent in upgrading and modernising networks.  As a result, today, approximately 1.4 million premises or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 megabits per second.  Significant further investment is anticipated over the next two years. My Department is running a procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a high speed broadband network within the State intervention area. Finalisation of the intervention area is the next key step in the procurement process. I expect this to happen in the coming weeks and it will allow bidders to prepare for the next stage of the procurement process, which is the submission by bidders of detailed solutions.  After the submission of detailed solutions, the procurement process will move to the final tenders and contract award stages. A number of initiatives have been developed to speed up the roll-out of high-speed broadband. My Department will engage with winning bidder or bidders on the best roll-out strategy in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand and a prioritisation programme will be put in place in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Two regional action groups have been established to work with local authorities, local enterprise offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate broadband roll-out in rural Ireland. The mobile phone and broadband task force has moved to the implementation phase.  The implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of the 40 task force actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. Each of the actions and implementation programme has its own timeframe for delivery. A copy of the report is available on my Department's website.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	252	I am still not clear, and neither are those who seek the implementation of this plan, on when we can expect to see the roll-out begin, let alone be completed. The national broadband plan has been talked about since 2012, although I will not lay at the Minister's door responsibility for the tardiness with which successive governments have dealt with it. The Minister has been in office for almost a year, yet we still have no tender in place. People are absolutely frustrated as a result. It is impacting on the way in which people do business in 900,000 premises across the State. It is also impacting significantly on the way families live their lives. I am inundated every week by mothers and fathers whose children are unable to complete dissertations or access information required for college and course work. In addition, small and medium enterprises, and farmers, across the country have the same broadband connectivity problems. As more and more services go on-line, the demands for broadband are increasing. Greater demand for access to these services requires greater band width, yet there is a poor level of service in so many areas. The Minister cannot allow this to continue so he will have to find a way to get this contract completed and begin the work. It is an emergency for many communities.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	253	My focus is on delivery, not dates. I am very much focused on delivering this matter. The roll out of the national broadband plan has already started. Commercial companies are spending €1.7 million per day on foot of the plan. In the coming weeks we intend to make significant progress on that. I included in the programme for Government a mobile broadband and wireless task force due to the challenge in reaching some communities and some homes. That task force will have a significant impact on the delivery of 4G and wireless services over the coming 12 months. Next month will see the auctioning off of the 3.6 gHz spectrum, which will provide additional bandwidth for wireless and mobile operators. That will help them to roll out their services and expand the services currently available. In tandem with that, I have allocated €8 million to RTE to release the 700 mHz spectrum.They will start work on that this summer and that will facilitate us in rolling out 5G throughout the country.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	254	It seems the Minister raised the issue of spectrum auction. Will he confirm to the House that the criteria around the auctioning of the spectrum will concentrate more on the geographic spread rather than on the amount of money that can be generated for the State coffers? The Minister is well aware that, notwithstanding what different mobile companies advertise in terms of their coverage, the bulk of their service, as a result of previous auctions, concentrates on population. That is because the criteria were in the past based around the return to the State. We have seen the folly of that in terms of the poor coverage in many less densely populated areas but yet it is vitally important to provide cover to ensure access to emergency services etc. Will he confirm to the House that at last he has understood the necessity to look at the geographic spread rather than following the population dispersal?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	255	Prior to becoming Minister I understood the difference between geographic and population. I have always insisted that we should be looking at geographic coverage. I have made my views quite clear on that, both publicly and privately. In regard to the 3.6 GHz spectrum, the auction is slightly different in terms of its objectives. The country is broken into nine different areas, both urban and rural. It will facilitate the roll-out of wireless broadband across the country and it will assist the mobile operators in regard to backhaul capacity as well. It is structured in such a way as to do that. The big issue is the next auction, which is the 700 MHz spectrum, which relates to 5G. It is my intention, and I will be pressing for it if at all possible, to ensure that is rolled out on a geographic rather than a population basis. The frequency of the 700 MHz spectrum allows for it to have far greater coverage. That would see high speed mobile broadband being provided right across this country. That is needed. I hope it will have the support of all sides of the House. 
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	256	I thank the Minister. He is a big supporter of the proposed hydroelectric plant in Silvermines in County Tipperary. There has been mining in Silvermines for 1,000 years. What is left there can be turned into something very positive by the €500 million potential investment that will go into the hydroelectric plant. Unfortunately we also have a legacy issue there, which is environmentally hazardous and has caused issues in the past with regard to human health and is currently causing issues with regard to animal health. There are lands there in which millions have been invested. A compulsory purchase order process has been started in relation to the tailings pond in Gortmore. I ask the Minister to execute that order and that the State consider the compulsory purchase of the remaining lands, which are currently for sale and which I do not believe it is appropriate to be maintained in private ownership.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	257	Since 2007, my Department in co-operation with Tipperary County Council, has undertaken an extensive programme of remediation works at a number of former mining sites at Silvermines, County Tipperary, with expenditure on the works totalling €11.2 million to date. The last substantive phase of the programme of remediation works to be completed is the work at the Garryard site. Progression of this phase of the programme is currently under consideration by my Department. My Department continues to work to ensure the protection of the investment already made and a long-term approach to the programme. The Department also has an ongoing programme of environmental monitoring of the sites concerned.  I understand that
SIGA-Hydro Limited is working on plans to develop a pumped storage electricity generation plant at Silvermines.  The proposed development would utilise the flooded open pit at the Magcobar site which was used to produce barite from 1963 to 1992. Limited remediation works have been carried out at the Magcobar site under the programme of remediation works including re-grading of spoil piles, demolition of derelict structures, fencing off dangerous areas and areas of mine heritage interest. It should be noted that the land and minerals at the site are privately owned and were registered as excepted minerals by the Mining Board with primary responsibility for any necessary rehabilitation resting with the owner.  There are no proposals to compulsorily purchase lands in the proximity of the Magcobar site.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	258	This is an ongoing legacy issue. A number of people before me have spoken about this. My own family worked in the mines for generations up until the 1980s. This cannot go on. The CPO process for the Gortmore tailings pond was started by the Minister's predecessor and I understood it was ongoing. There is no way we can allow €11 million to be invested into lands and then have the owner of those lands run horses across the lands, destroying the investment. We also have other sites now that are for sale. Currently, as I stand here in this Chamber, there are two families, who are dairy farmers, whose land is contaminated to the point where their milk is no longer accepted. There are other issues here. There are legacy issues here that are so deep that it will not be possible to remediate these lands and invest in them unless the State compulsorily purchases them. We need to complete the compulsory purchase order of the tailings pond area in Gortmore. The idea that these lands could be sold for development is absolutely criminal. The State needs to own these lands and I ask the Minister to ensure that it happens. I am not expecting it to be done tomorrow, but I would ask him to ensure the lands around this very positive development are mapped out and a process and plan is put in place to compulsorily purchase these areas for the benefit of all the people living there, for human health and animal health.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	I acknowledge the role the Deputy has as a constituency Teachta Dála, and his family history. I have spoken to him on this issue before. Regarding Gortmore, I understand from my Department that it is in discussions, through the Chief State Solicitor's office, with solicitors for the owners of the property. That is not to say it is expediting a CPO but it is in discussions to purchase the land. With regard to the unknown causes of cattle deaths, I am aware the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the environment section of Tipperary County Council are investigating the issues. They are taking water samples, which seem to be satisfactory, and they are looking at all possibilities, including paint or batteries that may have been dumped in the general area, to try to ascertain why exactly there has been animal deaths in the area. Clearly, regarding Gortmore, it is the largest section of concern within the Silvermines complex. We are trying to expedite a purchase of that through the Chief State Solicitor's office and we will continue with that.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	260	There have not been animal deaths there for some time. There were animal deaths due to lead poisoning. The issue now is that the actual soil is contaminated from the river. The lead levels have gone across into the soil and into the grass that was cut to make silage, which is fed to the animals. It will take a period of time for us to figure our exactly what is going on here. This will not end even if they find out what the issues are relating to those two farmers and their cattle. This will not end there. Until this State firmly takes control of this situation there will be ongoing issues here. The patience of the people living in the community there is worn out. I ask the Minister to at least meet with them or with the county council in the coming weeks to discuss this issue. I believe this can be solved over a short period of years. They are not looking for solutions immediately. They are just looking for a mapped way forward.  There is a huge development going on there, more than €500 million worth of an investment. It will provide 10% of the county's electricity when it is finished. It is a brilliant development that will clean up the Magcobar area. The ancillary side of this is that these lands need to be compulsorily purchased by the State, for what I would perceive to be very little money, and rehabilitated. At least if they are owned by the State we can put in place a plan to do that. Human health, animal health and the food that results from those animals are all the consequences of that. The State needs to intervene.

Discussions are ongoing through my Department and the Chief State Solicitor's office.  In respect of the Magcobar site, I understand that it would not be legally possible for the Department to compulsorily purchase any site unless it was necessary to remediate the land. The Department would not have a direct legal basis to do so. The county council may have a legal basis but it would need to check that in respect of very small sections of it. I would be very happy to discuss these issues with council officials and members of the community at a date to be arranged.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	269	The North-South interconnector is important for improving the efficient operation of the single electricity market and increasing security of electricity supply across the island of Ireland. On 21 December 2016, An Bord Pleanála granted planning permission for the North-South interconnector project in Ireland. The decision concluded a lengthy planning process which included an oral hearing completed over 11 weeks from March to May last year. The planning process in Northern Ireland is ongoing with the planning inquiry concluding on 27 February 2017. I am aware of views that have been raised by communities across Cavan, Meath and Monaghan that the transmission lines should be laid underground rather than built overhead. However, all evidence available to me indicates that developing the project underground would cost substantially more and deliver less. In particular, I would highlight the independent expert commission report of 2012 that estimated that the cost of building the project underground would be three times the cost of the overhead solution.  In light of the motions passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, I have requested officials in my Department to prepare a proposal for an updated independent report that would consider any changes in cost and technology in the five years since the 2012 report by the independent expert commission. My officials are currently preparing the terms of reference for this study which will bring further clarity to the relative cost and technical merits of overhead and underground solutions for the North-South Interconnector. I intend that this report would provide a comprehensive and independent analysis and it is my intention that the report be completed and published before the end of this year. Finally, I re-emphasise the Government's continued strong support for this project.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	270	The bottom line is that the majority of Deputies in this House agreed that there should be an entirely new independent expert analysis of the North-South interconnector complete with estimates of the cost of the project for tourism, agriculture, heritage, health and local communities, a decision with which Seanad Éireann agreed. In my view, that motion must be respected rather than overridden in any shape or form by the Minister and the Government's endless pursuit of what it believes to be the current situation. I understand that the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Regina Doherty, went on local radio the morning after the motion was passed and told the people of Meath that the Fianna Fáil motion would be implemented in full. Irrespective of whatever terms of reference the Minister intends to introduce in respect of this independent review, will he consult with our party, which put down the motion? I hope he would consult with all spokespeople on this side of the House. What I want from the Minister is a commitment that he will honour the motion that was passed by a majority of Deputies in this House. I received a bound copy of the motion from the Ceann Comhairle. It was passed by a majority of Deputies in this House, so surely that makes it incumbent on the Minister with responsibility for this area to give effect to the democratic wishes and will of this Parliament.

Similar motions have been passed by both Houses. I have directed my officials to prepare a proposal for me. I have not yet seen it. I have been pressing my officials on that because the argument made by the groups representing local communities I met here was that we did not have the most up-to-date information on costings. Examples were given of other projects in Europe. The advice that is available to me is that they are not comparable but I accept that we should look at these issues independent of the advice that is available to me. I must also say that judicial review proceedings are taking place. As Minister, I am party to one of those three judicial reviews. One of those reviews includes the North East Pylon Pressure group and an individual who have challenged An Bord Pleanála's decision to grant permission and its status as the lawfully designated competent authority.

I accept that the Minister listened to the debates intently. Listening is one thing but taking heed of the motion that was passed is another. In my view, what will show the Minister's sincerity is whether he is prepared to accept the legitimacy of the democratic wishes and will of this House and initiate a report. I accept that terms of reference need to be drawn up but the starting point and finishing point for those terms of reference must be in accord and in concert with the motion passed in this House. Will the Minister confirm to the House that he intends to follow the democratic wishes and will of the Members of this House?

The starting point was not the motion that was passed by this House. The starting point was the meeting I had with the communities where I thought they raised very valid questions. On foot of the raising of those questions, I immediately sought advice from my own technical adviser about the issues that were raised. There are legitimate questions that need to be clarified and this is what I intend to do. This is why I have asked my officials to take action on foot of what the communities have said to me and what has been raised here through the motions in the Dáil and the Seanad. I have not seen the detail of that as of yet. It has not come to me. I am awaiting it. What we need is to provide clear and definitive answers to the questions that have been raised by the communities on numerous occasions.

This plan crosses a number of different Departments and requires action across Government. How will this interaction take place to fulfill the requirements of this mitigation plan?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	276	I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 41 together. In line with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, I am required to prepare and submit a national mitigation plan to Government for approval no later than 10 June 2017. An important milestone in this work, and one required under the legislation, was reached last week when I published a draft of the national mitigation plan for public consultation. This consultation will help inform further work in my own Department and across Government to finalise the plan later this year. The consultation is an essential part of the process of public and stakeholder engagement on the challenges we face to meet our existing commitments and to begin the longer term process of transitioning Ireland to a low-carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  The draft plan has been prepared through close collaboration across all relevant Government Departments and, in particular, by the key Ministers responsible to the four sectors covered by the plan, including electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture, forestry and land use.This has been overseen by an interdepartmental national mitigation plan steering group as well as by both the senior officials group and the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action. Technical support has been provided to all the sectors by the technical research and modelling group which operates under my Department. In addition, the Climate Change Advisory Council was established as an independent statutory body under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. Its role is to assess and advise Government on policy related to climate change. As well as mechanisms to ensure interdepartmental co-operation, we also need to engage wider society with the challenge of climate change, motivate changes in behaviour and create structures at local, regional and national levels to support the generation of ideas and their transition into appropriate cost-effective actions.  To this end, I announced recently details of a national dialogue on climate action. It is important to note that the first national mitigation plan represents an initial step to set us on the pathway to achieve the level of decarbonisation required by 2050. It does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the 2050 objective but rather is a work in progress reflecting the reality of where we are in our decarbonisation transition. When finalised, the plan will become a living document that will be accessible on my Department's website and which will be continually updated as ongoing analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. In addition, there will be a formal preparation of successive national mitigation plans at least once every five years as provided for in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  I intend that these arrangements will continue to provide a clear Government focus to drive the ongoing development and implementation of the mitigation plan.  In terms of our 2020 emissions reduction targets under the EU’s effort sharing decision, it is expected, on the basis of the latest projections prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency, that we will fall short of meeting this target. The first national mitigation plan will provide the framework for continued work towards meeting our 2020 targets. Equally important, it will also begin the development of medium-term to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. On renewable energy targets, Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has estimated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015. The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date meeting the 16% target remains challenging. My Department is currently developing a proposed new renewable electricity support scheme and a new renewable heat incentive scheme, designed to assist in meeting our renewable energy supply - electricity, RES-E, and renewable energy supply - heat, RES-H, targets. The introduction of any new scheme, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported, will be subject to Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.

It is widely accepted, although perhaps not fully by Government at the moment, that we will miss those targets. The mitigation plan has been criticised because it fails to acknowledge the economic, human and environmental costs of not taking action and does not have a sense of urgency. It is widely accepted that addressing climate change is urgent. As the Minister outlined, the plan focuses mainly on cost-effectiveness but it also emphasises the financial costs and budgetary implications associated with implementing the climate actions. The key question is how the plan will be implemented across Departments. From experience I know that getting stuff done in one Department is hard enough. If we have to get two Departments to work together, we may as well forget about it. To get three to work together is impossible. This plan must focus on an across-Government approach. How is it envisaged that will happen?

One of the big problems is that we have not had an across-the-board economic analysis of the impact of climate change and its cost to the environment and society. The really frustrating aspect is that I, as Minister, was starting with a blank sheet. When the 20% targets were agreed, the then Ministers, John Gormley and Deputy Eamon Ryan, were pushing for a 30% target without having done an economic analysis of how we would achieve the 20% target and we now see the consequences. Now we are getting a 30% target based on cost-effectiveness. The Commission is taking that into account and acknowledging that cost-effectiveness must be part of it. The overall threshold across the EU is the same. The target is 40%. However, there must be an acknowledgement that the flexibility and the ability to do that varies across member states. There is far more flexibility in the emissions trading system where it is more cost-effective to make the changes, but sadly the bulk of our emissions are outside the emissions trading system.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	281	Will the mitigation plan be sufficient to meet our 2030 targets? No, not as it stands at present. First, this is a draft document and we are looking for feedback and submissions from the public on it. Second, this is a living, breathing document that will alter with the forthcoming budget and the review of the capital plan. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has directed that the issues and challenges that we face between now and 2030 are to be incorporated by Ministers in terms of their proposals for the capital plan. There will be a whole-of-Government approach. As Deputy Pringle noted, it is challenging. The heavy lifting has to be done by four Departments but there is a responsibility across Government to make the changes that are needed. For instance, the Department of Education and Skills has a role in terms of school building standards. Many other Departments also have a role to play. As the facilitating Department, we are actively trying to drive the type of change that is required and to engage directly with communities. This is why dialogue is so important. Up to now, we had the environmental lobby lecturing people and telling them how it was going to happen rather than engaging and working with them and assisting them with the active transition to a low-carbon society.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	286	It was outlined by the Minister that we are going to miss our targets. The approach is lack-lustre and the concern is that there is not just the question of environmental damage but also the potential of financial penalties. These must be avoided at all costs. We cannot allow ourselves to be the bad guys of Europe. We have an opportunity. We present a green image but, my God, we are not living up to it. We present this image of having safe food, and rightly so. We support that fully. However, we need to match our words and advertisements with action. We need a clear roadmap. There is a concern that goes across sectors, including the power and energy sector and the construction sector, especially the retrofit sector. We recognise that the agrisector is a difficult one in this regard but better farming practices can deal with it.While I recognise the Minister is new to this game, having been appointed only recently, he must act on this issue because we do not have time on our side. From July onwards, urgent action must be taken on transport. This will require increased investment in public transport, increasing the number of power points and having more light vehicles driven by renewable energy sources.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	287	Sometimes we are much too hard on ourselves. Ireland is leading the way in some areas. The beef data and genomics scheme is probably the most innovative step taken in agriculture anywhere in the world. I have been surprised by the number of ministers from abroad who have asked me about this scheme. The initiative taken by the Environmental Protection Agency on smart farming is putting cash in farmers' hands. On average, farmers in the scheme are saving €5,000 per annum, which is having a direct impact on the environment. On the basis of the work done by successive Governments in the area of energy efficiency, the International Energy Agency has asked me, on behalf of Ireland, to be the keynote speaker in June. In addition, the United States and many other countries are examining how our electricity grid operates. We should not always take a negative view because we are setting the agenda in some areas. I acknowledge, however, that we have a great deal of work to do, including on transport.

The key question is by how much the plan will change by June as a result of engagement with members of the public, non-governmental organisations and others who are seeking to frame a plan that sets out targets that must be met. How open is the Minister to having a plan that reflects ambitious goals, moves away from the issue of financial costs and budgetary processes and recognises the urgent need to take concrete action?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	289	While I acknowledge that some positive things are taking place, by the Minister's own admission both privately and publicly, Ireland has fallen behind and must catch up. We are approaching the edge of a carbon cliff, as I forecast several years ago. We must develop other sources of renewable energy, including grasping the nettle on solar power. There is opposition to everything. We must, therefore, present communities with a range of options because most sensible people would then accept that the Government and House are doing their best. Notwithstanding the role of Departments in this area, local government is the missing piece. To use a catchphrase, we must think globally and act locally. Local authorities have shown the way in the renovation and retrofitting of houses where they are doing significant work. I ask the Minister to discuss this issue with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, with a view to developing local government involvement in waste, local transport and public buildings. Local authorities can do much more. The power to devolve many more responsibilities to them is provided for in the Local Government Act. I ask the Minister to devolve powers to take specific measures to local councils, communities and people in order that we can get on top of the issue of climate change. 
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	290	To respond to Deputy Pringle's question, while I am very open to constructive suggestions, I am not open to the suggestion that we close down the three peat fired power stations tomorrow and have all the seasonal workers who are driving tractors become electricians and retrofit houses in Dublin. This is the type of solution that is being put forward. What we need are practical solutions and I am very open to any practical, logical solution regardless of who proposes it. I will address the issue of solar power in a couple of minutes. Deputy Stanley is correct on the role of local government. My Department works very closely with local authorities on waste initiatives, including reducing food waste, which has a direct impact on the environment. My local authority, Roscommon County Council, is involved in converting its vehicle fleet to a low emission fleet. The Department, through the ESB, is engaging with local authorities on the issue of public lighting with a view to reducing overall electricity demand. This will have a direct impact on the environment and generate additional funds for local authorities to be invested in other energy solutions and community projects. 
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	291	I ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of Coillte transferring a single wind turbine in the Sliabh Bawn wind farm development near Strokestown, County Roscommon, to local community ownership. This would provide free electricity for residents within a radius of five or ten miles from the site.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	292	The programme for Government recognises the importance of community participation in renewable energy projects in both the national and local interest. This builds on the 2015 energy White Paper commitment to widen the opportunity for community and citizen participation in renewable energy projects. While the specific proposal detailed by the Deputy is a commercial matter for Coillte, I am committed to ensuring community participation will be a key design parameter of the new renewable electricity support scheme which is under development in my Department. The new support scheme will be designed to enable communities to actively participate and invest in renewable energy projects, simultaneously reaping the benefits of renewable electricity projects in their local area and contributing to Ireland's low carbon energy future. A core part of this work is to identify ownership models and meaningful pathways for community participation in renewable energy projects and I expect the results of this analysis will be known shortly. It is expected that a second public consultation will issue in the second quarter of 2017 outlining various design options. However, following the outcome of this second public consultation and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission. Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in the first half of 2018. When the project on Sliabh Bawn was first proposed I met Coillte to discuss the specific issue Deputy Eugene Murphy raises. At that stage, I sought a dividend for those living in the vicinity of Sliabh Bawn who would be directly impacted by the project. I did not succeed, however, because I was virtually a lone voice on the issue. While everyone thinks it is a good idea now, I was unable to successfully progress the proposal at the time because the legislation and structures introduced before my appointment did not facilitate or allow for such a measure to be taken. I pressed Coillte, a semi-State company, on the issue of being seen to be best in class and it is my intention to ensure all projects in any new support scheme will have a community dividend tied into them. 
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	293	To be blunt, the Minister is my constituency colleague and he and I are in trouble as a result of wind farms, including the Sliabh Bawn wind farm. Like the Minister, I see the value of wind. However, I have argued for a long time that the stipulations and guidelines in place are out of kilter with the needs of people and their way of life. Coillte must start giving something back and this is one area where we could do something. The Sliabh Bawn wind farm was established under the old guidelines. I hope the Minister will be able to address the issues causing dissatisfaction in the community, including wind turbine noise and their size. As an advocate of wind power, I am not happy with the current structure as it does not provide a good method for dealing with local communities which, in turn, do not buy into wind power. While noise is not an issue for some people, it upsets and annoys others. The Minister should ensure Coillte holds regular meetings with community groups and considers new ideas. The issue of providing local communities with a wind turbine to meet their electricity needs is not new. The practice has been adopted elsewhere in Europe, including Scotland, and it works perfectly well.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	294	First, Deputy Eugene Murphy made the point that there is no good method for dealing with communities and he is correct that this was the case. That is why before Christmas I got the industry to sign up to a new code of practice. I acknowledge some of the people near Sliabh Bawn have dismissed that but it is funny that other communities in County Roscommon that have used the code have said that it has effectively dealt with the noise issue. It is, therefore, working in the county and I urge people to use the code rather than dismiss what we have succeeded in doing. I have said to Coillte officials on numerous occasions that there has to be a community dividend not just in respect of this wind farm, but of every wind farm in the country. The dividend has to extend beyond the term of the wind farm or project. I have publicly stated that the guidelines are not fit for purpose. It had been my intention to bring in new guidelines prior to Christmas but that was not possible because of the ECJ decision. They will deal with issues such as noise and shadow flicker because they have to be dealt with given that the current guidelines are outdated. There is an opportunity to get this right. They will go out for public consultation and I look forward to the feedback from communities and Members.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	295	When this development was proposed in 2011, no more than the Minister, I had many discussions with Coillte officials about giving a turbine to the community, the tourism project on Sliabh Bawn, which will be massive, and other issues. However, people have been affected by noise and by the development of the wind farm and they are unhappy. The wind farm is subject to the old guidelines and it is extremely important that the Minister and, indeed, all Oireachtas Members, acknowledge and accept that there is a huge difficulty with this project. We must acknowledge that people are unhappy. I fully understand that we are way behind in our renewable energy targets and 2020 is approaching. There will be massive fines on the State, which will fall back on the taxpayer. This development, however, cannot be undertaken on the backs of people who are unhappy. We must consult people and listen to their concerns. They are not all mad in respect of what they are saying. I have never opposed wind power but I have stood on my doorstep and the noise factor is extremely annoying. It upsets some people and not others. There are 250 wind farms in the country and the Minister needs to publish the guidelines and to meet people who are concerned. We need to examine their ideas and engage with them. The day of Coillte throwing a few euro to the community is gone and I ask the Minister to challenge Coillte to deal with that issue and to ensure communities get a fair crack of the whip.

That is why I put the code of practice in place and that is why the wind industry has written to every Member to tell them there is a new mechanism in place to deal with issues such as those being experienced by the Deputy. Noise is an issue and the new guidelines will reflect that. The Deputy asked me to meet the people concerned. I met all the players after I became Minister. I met representatives of the communities affected and the industry. I heard all voices before I considered the new guidelines. I listened to, and discussed, the issues that were raised. We had hoped to make progress on this but the ECJ took a decision that has set us back. It is my intention to have the draft guidelines put into the public domain as quickly as possible and to ensure they reflect the concerns that have been raised by communities not only in County Roscommon, but across the country. We cannot ignore these issues and brush concerns under the carpet. That is why the code of practice is in place and I urge people to use it.

Geoscience Ireland, GI, is an initiative under my Department managed through the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI. Geoscience Ireland is a business cluster of 31 indigenous Irish companies operating in the geoscience sector. The cluster is managed by the GSI, with support from Enterprise Ireland, EI, and a steering committee that also includes representation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.   GI was formed to maintain and create jobs in the geoscience sector by bringing together Irish companies to collaborate to win work overseas. It has been hugely successful to date with a net increase in job numbers of more than 470 since 2012. In 2015, the cumulative turnover of Geoscience Ireland companies was in excess of €310 million, 69% or €215 million of which was generated by exports. The minerals sector has been estimated as having a value of over €800 million to the economy. Geoscience Ireland, along with the GSI and EI, co-operates closely to promote the Irish geoscience sector. GI is also becoming recognised both nationally and internationally as a successful model for the creation and development of a sectoral cluster, with its expertise increasingly being shared with other initiatives in Ireland. GI member companies reported that 179 net new jobs were created in 2016. Those companies based or headquartered in County Kildare created a total of 46 net new jobs in 2016. It is estimated that approximately half of these jobs are based in Kildare, with the balance of staff distributed across branch offices in Dublin and the UK.

In 2010-11, GSI, EI and five reference companies in the geoscience sector identified opportunities for Irish companies on the international markets and established Geoscience Ireland to target those opportunities, thus protecting and creating jobs in the face of a beleaguered domestic market. The geoscience expertise offered by GI's consultancy companies include geology, geophysical and geochemical surveying, geotechnical engineering, civil engineering, environmental advisory planning and remediation, and hydrology and hydrogeology. GI member companies are operating and contracting works, providing services for mining and quarrying, drilling for mineral exploitation, and engaged in water and geotechnical projects and infrastructural development. In Kildare, GI companies established 46 new jobs in 2016 and there is great potential for job creation. They are allowing companies which are trying to expand into Europe to collaborate to best utilise their resources to win overseas jobs and investment and that will have a knock-on effect on companies headquartered in Kildare.

They added 28 jobs in Kildare with the balance of jobs created in Dublin and the UK. Currently, there are 31 partner companies, which is up from 28 in a short time. Companies are contacting GSI to become involved in Geoscience Ireland, which is an excellent recognition of the success of the programme and the collaboration between GSI and EI.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	305	The 2009 EU renewable energy directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable energy sources. The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. The 2015 Energy White Paper recognises the potential contribution micro-generation can make to Ireland meeting its renewable energy targets and commits to explore the scope to provide market support for micro-generation. My Department is currently developing a proposed new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, which will be designed to assist us in meeting our 2020 and 2030 renewable electricity targets.  As part of the RESS analysis, which is under way, providing pathways for micro-generation across a range of technologies is being assessed and community participation in Ireland’s renewable energy transition will be a key feature of the new scheme. This analysis will help shape effective policies and identify appropriate market intervention mechanisms to support these policy objectives. A second public consultation will be published in quarter two of this year outlining various design options. However, following the outcome of this second consultation and before any new scheme can be introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission. Subject to this, it is expected the new scheme will become operational in the first half of 2018.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	306	I thank the Minister. We have a huge challenge in reaching our renewable energy targets. We need more initiatives like the one the Minister has described which is very encouraging. We have opportunities in solar, hydro and biomass energy. There are also huge opportunities in offshore wind. There seems to be a focus, understandably, on larger scale energy producers. I want to raise the issue of micro-generation, that is, the small generation of electric power by individuals, small businesses and communities to meet their own needs or alternatively as a supplement to the traditional centralised grid connection. I have a constituent in east Clare who has been in touch with my office. He has put together and designed a power generating unit that can generate power off a local stream. It makes sense to me that an individual like that should be in a position to benefit from the initiative and sell that electricity to the national grid. Will the scheme the Minister is putting together deal with that issue?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	307	The new support scheme should be far broader than schemes up to now. Up to now the focus has been on onshore wind. There is an opportunity now to expand and look at both domestic and large scale solar, hydro, biomass, offshore wind energy and micro-generation. Micro-generation has to be part of that mix. I cannot give the Deputy a commitment on any specific project. There are a number of issues that would need to be looked at in that context, one of which is whether the grid at the location can take it. One of the issues we will have with some of these projects is the capacity of the grid. It is an issue that is coming up more frequently now in solar energy. At the moment there are enough solar applications for connection to the grid that if we turned off every power generating source on the island of Ireland, we would have enough solar capacity on a sunny winter's day to run the country.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	308	The Minister mentioned in his opening remarks the need to secure Government approval and that he had hoped that if he gets Government approval he could push on in the later stages of this year and perhaps next year. He also mentioned the question of state aid. Has the Minister made any inquiries on the state aid impact? Is he confident the scheme he is designing will get around that particular question?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	309	Has there been engagement with the Commission on state aid? Yes, of course, there has been. Our Department will be in regular contact across a number of areas. Is it likely it will get approval from the European Commission? Yes, it is our intention to design a scheme that will get the approval from the Commission. It is important to remember that under the renewable electricity support scheme, it will be funded through the public service obligation so we have to be cognisant of the impact that will have on both commercial and domestic electricity bills. If we were to approve every single solar application in the country, it would have a dramatic impact on the cost of electricity. It would significantly increase the cost of electricity in this country. We are trying to get cost-effective supports that can be put in place, acknowledging the need to expand the suite of renewable energy power generators that have been supported up to now and to try to support a far broader range.

When does he intend to do that? Will photovoltaic, PV, solar energy be included in it? Will he make a statement to the House on his intentions in that regard?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	311	My Department is currently developing a proposed new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030. Analysis is ongoing of the types of technologies to be included such as biomass, offshore and onshore wind, waste, and combined heat and power. This analysis also includes an assessment of the cost of supporting solar PV, both rooftop and ground-mounted. The programme for a partnership Government contains a commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland. I was the one who proposed that inclusion in the programme for Government. This builds on the 2015 Energy White Paper and recognises that solar has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby also enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future. The new scheme design requires detailed economic analysis on the viability and cost-effectiveness of supporting several renewable technologies at various scales. Once this analysis is complete, my Department will publish a second public consultation on the design of the new scheme. There will be many decisions to be made on the scheme with regard to scale and technologies and, in particular, how communities will have a greater involvement than in previous schemes. Following the outcome of this second public consultation and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in the first half of 2018. I am fully aware of the level of interest in the solar PV sector in Ireland. The most recent data available to my Department has indicated there have been over 550 applications, amounting to about 3,900 MW of solar capacity, seeking a connection to the electricity grid in the last 18 months. Notwithstanding the level of solar applicants seeking connection to the grid, my stated position on this is very clear. While solar energy has a role to play in Ireland's energy future, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people’s electricity bills through a higher public service obligation levy. In designing the new RESS, the needs of and cost implications for people and businesses will be foremost in my mind.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	312	I am well aware of the Minister's concerns about ensuring that those who use electricity, both domestically and commercially, have rates that are tolerable, do not damage their capacity to live in, heat and light their homes and premises and do not impact negatively on businesses, but Ireland is obligated to meet the EU's target of 16% of all energy being generated from renewable sources by 2020 and it is essential that we continue to grow our renewable capacity. Currently, we are nowhere near meeting out 2020 targets. The Minister knows that 27.3% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources in 2016, of which wind accounted for 23.2%. It would be foolhardy of the Government to continue its reliance on onshore wind energy, given that it does not guarantee security of supply. Instead, we should branch out and expand our renewable portfolio to include offshore wind, biomass, tidal and solar, where possible. There is little State financial support for those wishing to construct commercial solar energy facilities. The main renewable energy schemes are the new retrofit programme and the alternative energy requirement. The Government has been stalling on the details of the former for months, which it is now anticipated will be launched in late 2017. While costs have decreased considerably, industry experts agree that large-scale development of solar capacity is unlikely without State support. I appeal to the Minister to get the scheme up and running as quickly as possible. There is a trade-off with the potential cost to users, but we must meet our targets, given that the cost to the State would have to be paid by the taxpayer anyway if we failed to meet the targets.

Solar will be a part of that mix. Deputy Dooley is right, in that one of our main problems to date has been how we have effectively put all of our eggs in one basket, that being, onshore wind. There needs to be a broader suite of supports - solar, hydro, biomass and offshore wind. One of my first decisions as Minister and one of my first actions at the Council of Ministers was to sign an agreement with seven EU member states on developing our offshore capacity. Ireland's capacity is considerable and we are putting funding towards it. Subject to Government approval and state aid rules, I intend to put additional supports in place for offshore wind energy. Limited to 30 MW, there would be a payment of €260 per MW/h for wave and tidal generation to incentivise the sector and get it up and running. This will be on top of the €26.3 million that the Department set aside for the sector during the 2013-16 period.

Reverting to my colleague's question, we have reached people's full capacity to accept this technology. Solar energy can be captured without the same level of encumbrance on people's ability to enjoy their areas' amenities. The Minister must move quickly, given the impact of our inability to meet the targets. Breaching them will incur a significant cost, which will have to be paid for by the taxpayer. I appeal to the Minister to get the scheme up and running as quickly as possible. It has been delayed for longer than should have been the case. This is not to suggest that departmental officials are not working to their greatest extent, but we need action. In terms of how we have been reshaping our energy generation, 2020 is approaching quickly.

According to the projections available to me, however, we will meet our 2020 electricity targets. The main challenge for us will be heat. For this reason, priority within my Department has been given to the renewable heat incentive scheme, which we want to get operational as soon as possible. Once it is, our focus will move to the electricity sector. We do not want to make the mistakes that have been made elsewhere. Otherwise, Deputy Dooley would rightly lecture me. We saw what happened when Northern Ireland moved too quickly on the renewable heat incentive scheme. We have seen what has happened in other member states that did not put the proper checks and balances in place. I want to establish a renewables scheme that supports a range of options, is fair and balanced and does not leave the Exchequer or, more importantly, electricity users footing an inordinate cost.

Next is a grouping of three questions. The Minister has prepared a long reply and the two Deputies concerned will be entitled to supplementary questions. I will give the Minister two minutes and he should get through his answer as fast as possible, but it is a long response and I might have to cut him short.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	319	I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 53 and 64 together. The North-South interconnector is important for improving the efficient operation of the single electricity market, SEM, and increasing security of electricity supply across the island of Ireland. Currently, there is only a single high-capacity electricity interconnector between the transmission systems in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The proposed interconnector will add a capacity of 1,500 MW and remove a significant bottleneck, leading to the improved operation of the SEM. On 21 December, An Bord Pleanála granted planning permission for the North-South interconnector project. The decision concluded a lengthy planning process that included an oral hearing completed over 11 weeks from March to May of last year. The hearing considered submissions and witness testimony on a range of concerns, including the impacts on people, health, archaeology, flora, water, soils, land use and traffic. The inspector evaluated the testimony presented in favour of and against the overhead and underground solutions. In her report, she examined these issues thoroughly and concluded that a high-voltage alternating current overhead line was the best technical and economic solution for the interconnector in order to achieve the specified national energy objectives. The planning process in Northern Ireland is ongoing, with the planning inquiry concluding on 27 February 2017. I am aware of the views that have been raised by communities across Cavan, Meath and Monaghan to the effect that the transmission lines should be laid underground rather than built overhead. However, all evidence available to me indicates that developing the project underground would cost substantially more and deliver less. In particular, I would highlight the independent expert commission report of 2012, which estimated that the cost of building the project underground would be three times the cost of the overhead solution. I would also highlight the July 2014 work and findings of the Government-appointed independent expert panel, which found that the studies and work undertaken on the North-South transmission line project were compatible with the methodologies being employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects. In light of the motions passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, I have requested my officials to prepare a proposal for an updated independent report that would consider any change in cost and technology in the five years since the 2012 report by the independent expert commission. My officials are preparing the terms of reference for this study. I intend for this report to provide a comprehensive and independent analysis and to be completed and published before the end of this year. I re-emphasise the Government's continued strong support for this project.
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	320	I feel a sense of déjà vu, as I am sure the Minister does. During Question Time on 7 February, I appealed to him to withhold Government funding from the capital phase of the North-South interconnector project until such time as the impact of Brexit had been realised. Since then, the Houses passed Fianna Fáil motions calling for an independent expert analysis of the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the interconnector, so I was shocked by the Department's responses to my parliamentary questions on when the motion was due to be put into action. The Government is showing a blatant disregard for the democratic process by ignoring the recent Dáil and Seanad motions, which is clearly the plan, given the responses. The Minister plans to narrow the motions down to a minimal focus on the cost analyses of published studies and ensure that the commencement of construction in 2018 is not affected.It is in stark contrast to the motion which was passed, which included incorporating international industry expertise to examine the technical feasibility and the cost of undergrounding the North-South interconnector, but it also included evaluating the potential impacts of both undergrounding and overgrounding the North-South interconnector on surrounding areas considering such aspects as its impact on local tourism, health, landscape and agriculture and heritage.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	321	Again, unfortunately, the Minister's reply is most disappointing. In the week following the passing of the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion on the North-South interconnector, I asked An Taoiseach and the Minister what actions would be initiated by the Government on foot of the motion. Unfortunately, the only definitive response the Minister gave us was that construction would commence in 2018. The Minister referred to the report of An Bord Pleanála. I do not think any member of the Government should quote from such a report because it rubbished the contribution of Members of the Oireachtas, including Ministers who participated in the oral hearing. All of the Oireachtas Members from Cavan, Monaghan and Meath participated in the oral hearing but it is as if we were not even there. We had a good meeting with the Minister when he met representative organisations from Monaghan, Meath and Cavan. He referred earlier in response to Deputy Dooley that the Department would finalise the terms of reference on the very narrow and restrictive report that will be initiated following the passing of the Fianna Fáil motion. The Minister promised on the morning of the meeting that he would have further consultation both at official level and political level with the organisations representing communities in the three counties. Could he give me a firm assurance that before the terms of reference are finalised he will meet a small representative group from the organisations that have been actively campaigning in order that they can outline the strong views, concerns and worries of communities in the three counties? The Minister referred previously to his contribution in getting various issues included in the programme for Government, which we all welcome. There is a specific commitment in the programme for Government to better engagement by Government in the advancement of energy policy, with specific reference to the provision and development of energy infrastructure.

Deputy Eugene Murphy and I discussed one of those projects in my constituency. I cannot reopen every decision that has been made by every Minister prior to me, but what I can do is ensure that we learn from the mistakes of the past in terms of some of the projects. That is the commitment that is contained in the programme for Government. In response to the Deputy's comment on An Bord Pleanála, as he is aware there is a judicial review and I cannot comment on the matter as I am one of the named parties in one of the judicial reviews, as is the Department. The Government is not providing funding for the North-South interconnector. Funding will be provided by electricity users of the interconnector across the country who will be charged via the operators of the network. That has always been the case. The purpose of the interconnector is to stabilise the grid north and south of the Border. As I said previously to Deputy Dooley, my starting point was the engagement I had with the communities here in Leinster House before any motion was brought to the House. I listened to them. I believe I was the first Minister since Deputy Eamon Ryan to meet with them and listen to the points they raised. They raised legitimate questions that require answers. That is the reason I facilitated further engagement at official level. I sought clarification from the expert technical advice within the Department. That is the reason we are now putting terms of reference in place.

Is the Minister aware that there are almost 4,000 people on the housing waiting list in County Louth? Many of them have been waiting more than nine years to be housed. The situation in County Louth is shocking, and given the scale of the housing crisis I am sure that is replicated right across the State. The number of applicants on the housing waiting lists exceeds the entire supply of council-owned housing stock in County Louth. That is a shocking statistic to bring to the attention of the House. Three generations of families live under one roof in overcrowded conditions. There are no affordable properties and there is a chronic shortage of private rental accommodation, and such accommodation that is available is not affordable for most. Where rental accommodation is available, landlords refuse to take tenants in receipt of the housing assistance payment. Meanwhile, there are 54 acres of council-zoned landbanks throughout the county. In the case of Louth County Council, it must pay €3 million a year in interest only for the loans on the landbanks. The €3 million comes out of the local authority's own budget so citizens are deprived of vital services and amenities because the council must pay such an amount in interest on the landbanks. Meanwhile, the land lies idle and barren as not a single house has yet been built. Last July, the Minister launched his Rebuilding Ireland document, yet several months later in November, when I asked him about council-zoned landbanks and landbanks belonging to local authorities, he said he had not collated any data. It surprised me that in the middle of a housing crisis one of the first ports of call would not be to ascertain what land belonged to local authorities across the State on which one could roll out a proper social housing provision programme. The Minister had not even bothered to collect the data. That adds weight to the criticism of the Minister and the Government that the Government's response to the housing crisis is developer led and developer driven. The landbanks in County Louth consist of almost 54 acres. They are in Mullavalley in Louth village, Kilkerley, Ballymakenny Road in Drogheda, Mount Avenue and Point Road in Dundalk and Newtown Meadows in Drogheda.There are over 20 acres of those 53 acres of land in Drogheda and not a single house has been built. What plans does the Minister have? Why is he, point blank, refusing to give funding for the roll-out of a social housing building programme on these lands I have identified?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	331	The Deputy's general question was not specific to Louth but I will certainly deal with Louth as well. Rebuilding Ireland contains a number of integrated actions to underpin active land supply management for the delivery of housing. Initially, this involves identifying and mapping sites in local authority and public ownership, with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed tenure housing, including social and more affordable homes, to meet demand. Our aim is to use publicly-owned land banks much more strategically than we did in the past. The mixed tenure approach allows for risk sharing and far quicker delivery of homes on the site as a whole. Most important, mixed tenure developments are about meeting the housing need of those on the housing list as well as those who do not come under the income thresholds in terms of qualifying for social housing support but still have difficulty meeting the cost of their accommodation. With regard to the mapping project specifically, the Housing Agency, in close consultation with my Department and local authorities, including Louth, has already commenced the mapping of approximately 700 sites in local authority ownership and those held by the agency under the land aggregation scheme, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information. The data that was compiled did not exist when the Deputy initially asked the question. This mapping exercise will form part of the broader national land supply management strategy as committed to under action 3.5 of Rebuilding Ireland, which is being developed within the context of the national planning framework, Ireland 2040. We expect to be in a position to publish a map of some 700 local authority and land aggregation scheme sites, together with lands zoned for residential development, in the coming weeks. This map will be updated regularly over time to ensure the best possible information is publicly available. With regard to funding providing for housing on local authority-owned lands, under Rebuilding Ireland, a highly ambitious programme of 47,000 social housing homes will be delivered by 2021, with funding of €5.35 billion. My Department engages on an ongoing basis with all local authorities, including Louth, Meath and others in the greater Dublin region, to consider proposals for the delivery of their social housing programmes. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I have met directly with local authority chief executives and elected members, assuring them that funding is available to advance new projects and to urge the swiftest possible progress on the overall building programmes. The Minister and I were in Louth and met the chief executive of that council, as well as councillors, stressing the need to bring forward a pipeline of projects. Already a substantial pipeline of new social housing construction projects has been created, reversing the decline of previous years, when local authorities and approved housing bodies had seen much reduced activity in the area. In the Deputy's own county of Louth, for example, there are now 26 projects. Louth County Council and various approved housing bodies will deliver 348 homes at various stages of the construction project life cycle. My Department recently published a full list of social housing construction projects, involving 8,430 homes in total across 504 projects. They are available on the website and I have the list for Louth here. I can give it to the Deputy, as it lists 26 projects and the various stages at which they are. We are keen that all projects should be advanced as quickly as possible and I have assured local authorities that funding is available for well-planned, quality projects that fully support efforts in this regard. At its heart, the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness is about increasing and accelerating housing delivery across all tenures to meet housing needs. The active pursuit of housing provision on State lands, including local authority land, is an important part of delivering on the overall ambition. A vital first step is to identify and map the sites in local authority and public ownership with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed tenure housing, including social and more affordable homes to meet demand. That work is well under way and I expect detailed mapping of local authority housing lands to be completed by the end of March. I spoke directly with the Deputy's housing officials in Louth, along with councillors, to help bring this forward and make suggestions for various sites. We are in the business of doing that and they will bring forward initiatives based on the various sites they own. Approximately 55 acres of land belong to Louth County Council and we have asked it to bring forward a pipeline of projects with that. There are 26 in play now and we are open to discussing more on that, including the various lands referred to by the Deputy. We have been very clear with Louth County Council and we want more development. We are willing to work on that.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	332	Imagine we are now over eight months after the launch of the Rebuilding Ireland document and the Government still has not completed the mapping of the local authority land banks. That demonstrates the priority afforded by the Government to the funding of social housing provision. It is eight months since the launch and we are in the midst of a housing crisis but the Government still has not completed the list of land banks across the State. It beggars belief. The Minister of State indicates there are 26 different projects but only six are being done by the local authority. The rest are from public-private partnerships and approved housing bodies. With the six developments, there will be a total of 123 homes over the next two to three years. There are 4,000 people on the housing list and the Government plans to provide 123 homes over the next three to four years. Of those homes, 20 have an unknown date of completion, seven are regeneration projects and 24 come from the acquisition of vacant units. There are three being done up on Bóthar Brugha in Drogheda that are just being renovated. There seems to be no roll-out of a proper Government-funded social housing provision. Not all the local authority members were impressed by the Minister of State or the delivery he has overseen. The Government still has not finished the report detailing the mapping of council-owned lands. It is essentially saying, right in the midst of a housing crisis, that Louth should be happy enough with 123 houses, with only a certain number being newly built, over the next three to four years. The problem will be compounded further. It is clear as a bell that the Government's entire policy to solve the housing crisis is developer-led and developer-driven. That is just not going to work.

We are committed to social housing projects and putting the capacity back in the system to deliver social housing. There is a commitment of approximately €5.5 billion for social housing and 47,000 housing units throughout the country. Louth will play a major part in that. We have engaged the local authority and we have the land bank compiled for Louth County Council. There are 55 acres and I can go through all the sites as it is here in front of me.

We have engaged with the local authority to ask it to bring forward proposals for all these different sites. On some sites there has been an application for funding from the local infrastructure fund; that will be announced at the end of the month and I hope some of the sites in Louth will be able to benefit so we can activate these sites. Most of the housing projects that have been committed to are being done in conjunction with or through Louth local authority. There is a total of 594 houses already in play but I am not in any way saying that is enough. We want much more than that and we have engaged with local authorities on the issue. We have made it clear the funding is there to develop this pipeline of houses. We will use land banks of public lands but we want to see more housing. We have said that to the council in Louth. Contrary to the Deputy's opinion, we had a very constructive meeting with all the councillors, including those from the Deputy's party, on two occasions. All the questions would have been answered and dealt with and they were probably surprised by some of the responses. I totally accept that Sinn Féin claims it wants to build more social housing, although I have not seen funding for that.

We have made strong commitments in that respect. The money is there to do it now. We have been very clear in saying that Louth's local authority should bring forward its proposals. There are plans in place for a pipeline of nearly 600 houses. It is not enough to solve the housing crisis and we want to do more. It is not true to say there are 4,000 people on the social housing waiting list in Louth as the figure is 2,600. The Deputy should use the facts.

This station was one of those closed between 2012 and 2013 when 139 were shut due to budget cuts. I have always opposed the closing of this Garda station and I endeavoured, particularly during the general election campaign, to say to the residents of Stepaside that I am very committed to having this Garda station re-opened, although I could never give a guarantee in that regard. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has said there will be a review in May and I very much welcome that. I have a number of questions for the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.There is a good argument, as far as I am concerned and as far as the Policing Authority should be concerned, for the re-opening of this particular Garda station above and beyond any other one. There is a 10% increase in population - 2,632 people in Stepaside itself. I also take this opportunity to mention the Stepaside business people, who seem to have been lost in all of the media coverage of this Garda station and who started the petition. Mr. Des Kennedy was one of them. There is Mr. Michael Fleming, there is Garda Pat Cullen, who has acted as a community garda liaison, and Mr. John McCluskey of The Step Inn. I refer to many of the residents' committees, such as of Leopardstown Hall, Sandyford Hall and The Gallops. There have been a lot of issues regarding the exploitation of the fact that there is no Garda station in the Stepaside area. We have had incidents at Hallowe'en. Ms Antoinette Cunningham, who is the president of the AGSI, criticised the station's closure and cited a significant increase in burglaries in the area, and I am very concerned about that. It was reported last year that there was a 50% increase in burglaries recorded in the general environs of Stepaside since the closure of this Garda station, and with the growing population and an increased demographic, it is clear that this community needs a Garda station. The questions I would like to put to the Minister are as follows. Why was the report's publication delayed for so long? It is now four years since the closure of this Garda station. The review is taking so long. What criteria will be used to determine which Garda stations will be re-opened? Obviously, there is a concern in Stepaside. The Policing Authority is an autonomous authority and has to be independent. Even so, I would like to know what criteria will determine which Garda station will re-open. How long is it expected to take, following the publication of the Garda review in May, for the six pilot Garda stations which have been outlined in the programme for Government to be picked? How long will that pilot period be? What factors will determine whether the stations will remain open after the pilot period? Will the stations to be re-opened under the pilot scheme be upgraded and refurbished as per the programme for Government's promise for, "new and refurbished Garda Stations throughout the country, which will be critical to delivering effective policing". That is enunciated quite clearly in the programme for Government. I was involved in those negotiations. I would like to see whether that will be delivered in the case of Stepaside Garda station if that station is picked as a pilot station. What level of staffing will be given to the re-opened stations? There is no point in having a Garda station that is not manned. If Stepaside Garda station is successful in being picked by the Policing Authority, I would like to know whether it will be staffed. I note there is Operation Thor, but there is some comfort to be taken by the people knowing that gardaí are there in the station available to take calls when its needed.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	340	On behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality who, unfortunately, cannot be here, I apologise and thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. I will not be able to answer all of the Deputy's questions but I have taken note of them, and those that I cannot answer, I will bring back to the Tánaiste. The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to her, including regarding Garda stations. As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Síochána district and station rationalisation programme gave rise to the closure of some 139 Garda stations in 2012 and 2013, following the completion by An Garda Síochána of a comprehensive review of its district and station network. That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. The Tánaiste has been informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front-line gardaí to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations. The programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. Revisiting the decisions made to close Garda stations at the depths of the recession is also part of that commitment. In this context, the Tánaiste, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, has requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify six stations for re-opening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. The pilot will feed into the wider review being undertaken by the Garda Síochána Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda Síochána in the delivery of policing services to local communities. I understand that work is continuing in An Garda Síochána to identify the six stations for inclusion in the pilot - unfortunately, I cannot inform the Deputy of some of the criteria of how they are picked - and that consultations have taken place with relevant stakeholders, including the Policing Authority. I also understand that the Tánaiste expects to receive a report from the Commissioner by the end of May in connection with the exercise. While I can appreciate that the Deputy would wish that the process was completed sooner, I am sure she will agree that a comprehensive and evidence-based analysis should be carried out, taking account of all the relevant factors, before a final decision is made in respect of the stations to be reopened by the Commissioner. I am sure the residents in Stepaside would agree that such a process is probably extremely important and worthwhile.

I appreciate, as I stated earlier, that the Policing Authority is autonomous and that we cannot predetermine the outcome of its review of Garda stations. Having said that, I would like to know the Minister of State's response regarding me not being allowed know the criteria for the reopening or otherwise of a Garda station. While I accept the Minister of State saying it is evidence based, I do not understand why I am not allowed to know what the criteria are. It would be helpful for the residents to know that. As the Minister of State can appreciate, the Stepaside area and the suburbs, because it has become such a national issue and the media have been so strongly talking about it, has been exposed for over four years at this stage and the residents are concerned that it is left as an own-goal for vandalism, hooligans and robberies. I would like to be able to tell them the criteria that will be used by the Policing Authority. In some way, we may be able to help the Policing Authority in informing its decision that Stepaside is a valid Garda station to be re-opened, not only on a pilot basis but on a permanent basis, and as I said, that it would be a refurbished Garda station because the building itself needs significant work and that it would be staffed on a daily basis so that it will be in a position to take calls when there is an incident in the area. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could answer those questions.

I suppose everybody would have some merit in being included in the scheme. I am not aware of whether the Tánaiste has the criteria or whether she is allowed to let that information out to various different areas. I stress the Government's commitment to ensuring that there is a strong and visible presence of the police force on the ground within the stations supporting the communities. I stress the commitment to a workforce of over 21,000 personnel by 2021. I understand the Deputy's frustration on this issue. I suppose reports generally tend to take longer than we would like but there is the commitment that this report will be finalised by the end of May. Of course, I will bring Deputy Madigan's concerns and the various questions that she asked that I have not been able to answer to the attention of the Tánaiste and ask her to respond to the Deputy directly.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	343	Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as ucht an deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo anocht. I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this important issue on the floor of the Dáil. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for coming in to take this Topical Issues debate. I can say with confidence that, normally, if I have an issue with the HSE, I can deal directly with the management and they are co-operative and always forthcoming with information. I have always found them most helpful.However, this issue caused me some alarm over the past week when the Dáil was not sitting and I was anxious to bring it to the Minister's attention on the floor of the House. I refer to the significant delays in the provision of radiotherapy treatment at Cork University Hospital, CUH, for cancer patients. Patients attend on a daily basis for radiotherapy treatment as they battle cancer. CUH is a centre of excellence serving County Cork and the only facility providing this treatment for cancer patients. Obviously, it is of vital importance to an enormous region in the context of a very dangerous illness, cancer. As such, we want to ensure that the service runs at 100% of capacity. Having spoken to a number of patients who have been availing of the radiotherapy in CUH, I understand that there have been significant delays in treatment in the past number of weeks. The service is operating at 75% capacity usually but on the Thursday before last an incident with one of the machines meant it was running at only 50% of capacity. That delayed the treatment of patients, many of whom had to wait for hours. That wait of hours occurs in a context where patients must attend every day for a period of six to eight weeks. They travel long distances from the constituency I represent in west Cork. If one lives on the Beara Peninsula and must travel to CUH, it is a round trip of more than three hours. If one has delays of two or three hours each day during one's treatment, it is very significant and an added trauma we want to avoid for patients at all costs. There is also an issue with optimum treatment time. If a person is post-operative, it is ideal to have the treatment begin within six weeks. However, I spoke to someone whose treatment did not begin until nine weeks after an operation due to the delays in CUH. While the treatment is not being cancelled, it is certainly being delayed significantly for patients. There appears to be a level of underperformance at this centre of excellence and I am adamant and anxious on behalf of patients that whatever resources are needed be given to the management of CUH without delay to ensure that radiotherapy services can operate at the optimum level so that patients get timely access to life-saving and necessary treatment. We must avoid inflicting any further stress on them. Every patient to whom I spoke asked me to acknowledge the exceptional courtesy, care and attention they receive from staff at CUH. They are clearly doing everything they can to ensure that patients are looked after. However, I understand that there are a number of issues with resources. I am grateful to have been allowed to raise this important issue.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	344	I thank Deputy Jim Daly for raising this extremely important issue. I join him in acknowledging the excellent work of the staff and the care they provide. The priority is to ensure that people who are suffering do not have that suffering added to. We must provide them with as much support as possible. The Minister, Deputy Harris, sends his apologies, but I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue. The radiation oncology unit at CUH is currently installing a new oncology information system which requires the transfer of patient data to a new system. The work is being undertaken on a phased basis and two of the four linear accelerator machines in the radiation unit in Cork have now been upgraded to the new system. Following this upgrade, there were some delays which affected capacity on the linear accelerators. The cause of this problem has been identified and the necessary changes to the software have been made to rectify the situation. CUH has assured the Department that at no stage during this installation programme has a patient's treatment been cancelled. The CUH management team is continuously monitoring the upgrade programme. I acknowledge, however, that while no appointment has been cancelled, there have been some delays because the service has been unable to operate at full capacity. Radiation therapy is an integral part of cancer treatment with 50% to 60% of all cancer patients requiring it at some point in the care pathway. Modern radiotherapy now requires highly sophisticated hardware and software to deliver treatment. This increased complexity has resulted in the more accurate delivery of radiation doses to cancers while simultaneously sparing more normal tissue. New advances are being made in radiation therapy treatments, including the provision of brachytherapy, leading to improvements in patient outcomes. Radiation oncology is provided in five public hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway and services are contracted from private facilities in Limerick and Waterford. Patients from the north west can now be referred to the north west cancer centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry for treatment. That offers them treatment much closer to their homes than was previously available. The national plan for radiation oncology will oversee the further development of radiation oncology facilities in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The completion of the national programme for radiation oncology is a priority for the Department. I am pleased to inform the House that work on the new radiation oncology facility at CUH is under way. Construction on the main contract to provide what will be a very important and much-needed facility for patients receiving radiation oncology services in Cork commenced yesterday. The new unit will comprise five new linear accelerator machines which is one extra over the current capacity. It is expected that the new facility will be fully operational by the end of 2019. The Minister reiterates his commitment to providing safe high-quality radiation therapy to patients in Ireland and assures the House that at no stage through this installation programme has a patient's treatment been cancelled. However, I acknowledge that the hospital would like to schedule more patients for treatment on daily basis. Due, however, to the outdated machines currently available, that has not been possible. With the five new accelerator machines, which is one additional machine, the hospital will be able to increase provision.

"Cancellation" is a word which the HSE can state definitively does not apply, but I understand that one cannot cancel radiotherapy treatment as such. It must continue albeit it can be delayed for a day or two. However, it cannot be cancelled. We may be mixing up words or perhaps it was not the best word to put forward in the debate. While I appreciate that nothing has been cancelled, there have been delays and it is that issue which is causing people concern. The HSE has put up its hands and said the installation of new equipment has caused delays. No party to this debate needs me to explain the trauma cancer imposes on people. It is incumbent on the HSE management and on us as legislators to ensure that when new systems are put in place, a smooth transition occurs and that no delays are caused. They contribute very significantly to the burden on patients who are attending on a daily basis and must wait around for three, four and five hours for treatment. Others may have to wait for another week for a treatment to start. It is not good enough that we are using the installation of new machines as an excuse. This is a modern era in which we should be able to prepare for such transfers and avoid adding these delays and traumas to people's existing burdens. The cancellation issue arises in respect of the rolling closures of the theatre for cancer patients which is an added complication. Several procedures for cancer patients have been cancelled in theatres because of staffing issues at CUH, which is another cause of concern and something I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister of State to pass on to the HSE.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	346	I do not disagree with what the Deputy says. The HSE's national cancer control programme has set performance targets to measure timely access for patients to radiation oncology treatments. The target is that 90% of patients will undergo this therapy treatment within 15 days. According to the national figures for 2016, 83% of patients commenced radiotherapy treatment within 15 working days. In Cork, the figure was 71%, which was slightly below the national average. The latest figures available, which are for January 2017, show that the national figure was 75%, with 72% of Cork patients commencing treatment within 15 working days. While it is not an excuse, the HSE has identified the new equipment as the reason patients' treatment was not able to progress. The HSE hopes the extra linear accelerator machine will allow CUH to process patients faster and possibly outdo the national average. On the rolling closures, the recruitment embargo has left many hospitals, including CUH, in a difficult position. The opening up of that recruitment means it is hoped to fill those places and to cease rolling closures by the end of April this year. Any of the Deputy's other queries which I may not have addressed, I will bring back to the Minister on his behalf.

The deadline for the rural social scheme in County Cavan is today and my office has been inundated with requests for application forms. They are being well utilised. One need only look around communities in the country to see the valuable work that would not be completed if these schemes ceased to exist. The Government's argument is that unemployment figures are in decline but not everywhere in the country has seen the benefits of economic recovery and I refer to my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. In truth, these schemes fill the holes in State structures that have been left by Government cutbacks. I speaking of the cuts to staffing and resourcing that Cavan and Monaghan county councils have endured. One need only consider the poor conditions of the road network and the impact the lack of a local improvement scheme is having on rural communities although this discussion is for another day and with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. As for the community employment schemes, Tús and the rural social schemes, my constituency office has received hundreds of calls since Christmas to report incidents of illegal dumping. In my native town of Bailieborough, people are willing to help through such community schemes and throughout the constituency, great work has been done to clean up the countryside. People living alone in rural villages in Cavan and Monaghan benefit hugely from the rural social scheme. In 2016 approximately 37,000 people were working in Tús, community employment schemes and the rural social scheme and were doing valuable work in our communities. How can rural Ireland sustain any cuts to these important schemes? I call on the Minister for Social Protection to give assurances that the future of such community schemes will be protected and, if anything, enhanced. In particular, I seek the abolition of the time limit for certain schemes. Community schemes such as the community employment scheme, Tús and the rural social scheme are invaluable programmes in which local people provide important services in towns, villages and rural areas throughout the country. Community ventures such as the maintenance of football pitches, green areas and community halls are carried out by people on such schemes. In many cases, were it not for these programmes the work would not be done at all as many local authorities lack the resources or manpower to do them. This is where they fill a gap. My offices in Cavan and Monaghan have been contacted by a number of people who are concerned about the future of the Tús scheme in particular. I need assurances from the Minister that the scheme, along with the community employment scheme and the rural social scheme, will be continued and that the repressive time limits for certain schemes will be lifted. The benefit of these schemes include giving participants a sense of purpose, re-engaging them with the workplace and ensuring essential work is carried out in communities. Many of the people who participate in the schemes can find it difficult to get into the workplace. The idea of forcing them back onto jobseekers' allowance is counter-productive. It can have a negative impact on people and would deprive communities of experienced workers who could make a valuable contribution. I call on the Minister to examine the time restrictions attached to some of the schemes in order that people can continue to participate in these essential programmes. The value is for both the individual and the local community.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	348	I thank Deputy Smyth for raising this important issue. I am taking this debate because the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is detained in the Seanad. The community employment scheme and Tús are part of the Department's range of programmes and schemes catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market. They are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person's opportunities of returning to the labour market. Employment programmes are a vital service in local communities, especially throughout rural Ireland. The programmes deliver on two levels. They provide a person who is unemployed with the opportunity of work experience and to develop new skills to prepare him or her for employment in the open labour market. They also play a very important role in augmenting service delivery to local communities in key areas such as child care, health and social care, drug rehabilitation and local amenities. All areas of the country have benefited from these programmes. In fact, I have seen this at first hand over recent months when I visited various schemes throughout the country. As the economic recovery takes hold and the overall level of unemployment continues to fall, the need to adapt employment programmes to the changing circumstances, opportunities and the needs of jobseekers has become more apparent and urgent. With this in mind, the Department undertook an analysis of the community employment scheme, and while the primary focus was on this scheme, the review also looked at other employment programmes such as Tús. The report made a number of recommendations on the operation of these schemes. As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister recently brought a memorandum to Government on the programmes and obtained approval to publish the review report and to progress the various recommendations. He intends to publish the review report within the next two weeks. As part of the roll-out of the new measures, the Department will consult key stakeholders in the coming weeks and implementation of the new measures will be progressed thereafter. The nature and format of the consultation process are being finalised by officials of the Department. I assure the Deputy the work being done through programmes such as the community employment scheme and Tús is highly valued and recognised by the Government. The changes to be rolled out over the coming months will strengthen the schemes and help to ensure they continue to support unemployed people and the provision of services across communities in Ireland.
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	349	I thank the Minister of State and I hope the commitment is there to strengthen and enhance the schemes and that there will be no reduction in them. I am being honest when I state rural constituencies such as Cavan-Monaghan have not seen the economic recovery about which we hear so much talk in the Chamber. It really has been the more urban areas which have been affected by it. Rural areas totally depend on such schemes and as their local authorities do not have the manpower they used to have for roads, libraries and community spaces such as playgrounds, the schemes are very important in this regard. Concerns are being raised about access to JobPath for community employment scheme participants. It appears JobPath seems to take precedence. My colleagues in Fianna Fáil and I have had huge issues involving people who have a place available on a community employment scheme and who have a genuine interest and skills to impart and use in their communities. Once they are signed up to JobPath, however, there does not seem to be any room for manoeuvre or to be able to negotiate going from one scheme to the other. This is a huge problem which needs to be dealt with. Community employment schemes have grown to develop great social and economic benefits for our communities and we must be mindful of the impact JobPath is having on them. While the goal is to move the majority of people into full-time sustainable employment, we need to be cognisant that a one-size-fits-all approach is not suitable for everybody and therefore a degree of flexibility is needed in the activation scheme, along with an awareness of the people's age, skills set, previous experience, needs and goals. Many Deputies have been contacted by people having huge difficulties because they have signed up for JobPath and wish to move to a community employment scheme but the flexibility to do this does not exist. It is a specific issue that needs to be addressed.

She spoke about County Cavan and mentioned that she has received a number of calls in recent days in this regard and this is an issue I will bring back to the Minister. She raised other points regarding infrastructure, transport and roads in rural areas and this is something about which I can speak to the Minister, Deputy Ross. I accept the importance of community employment schemes for the 37,000 people on them because it gives them a sense of purpose and I totally agree with the Deputy on this.Even this morning, the Ministers, Deputies Leo Varadkar and Simon Harris, and I were dealing with the issue - it is not directly related but is in the same territory - of 250,000 people with disabilities receiving a social welfare, illness or disability benefit, weekly payment. We have accepted and are looking at the idea of employment for them. We have come across and examined very closely the barriers stopping them from getting involved in more meaningful employment. There is the threat of the loss of a medical card on lower earnings. Where the system does not support early intervention, the issue of overall income support for people with disabilities is very complex and people with disabilities are reluctant to lose the security provided by the social protection system. That fits in with what we are doing. Deputy Bríd Smyth mentioned access to schemes and the need to manoeuvre. That is a very valuable point. I accept the Deputy's point that one size does not fit all when looking at schemes. I mentioned those in my area responsibility - the disabiliy sector. We have to have flexibility and be able to manoeuvre. If there are people with particular skills in certain areas, whether it be child care, the disability sector or in dealing with mental health issues, we should be looking seriously at particular projects. I will bring all of the issues raised by the Deputy back to the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar.

and- further recognises that, despite the high number of people who passed through homes and institutions and through the hands of various other bodies, the State has to date failed to initiate a meaningful process that would help to obtain the truth for survivors, nor has it provided a suitable forum that would allow the full story of these institutions and the system that underpinned them to be made public;agrees that:- a truth commission, involving international experts, should be established, that would be based on the principals of best practice from the truth processes in Chile, South Africa, Canada and Australia and would be developed in consultation with both victims and survivors groups;- the purpose of a truth commission is to establish the truth of these institutions, to give the survivors the option to tell their testimony in a non-confrontational, non-adversarial manner and in either public or private, whichever they are at ease with; and- its purpose is part of a wider process to identify the persons and institutions responsible for the systematic mistreatment and abuse of women and children withinthese care homes and the system as a whole but is not a substitute for the justice system or future criminal proceedings should they be deemed necessary anywhere on the island of Ireland; andfurther agrees that the truth commission shall:- operate on a modular basis in order to ensure that older survivors are among the first to be heard;- provide for public or private hearings, at the discretion of survivors, at suitable locations throughout the 32 counties where testimonies can be made;- involve an advisory committee, including victims representatives;- allow for testimonies from all survivors of care homes and their next of kin, without bias;- ensure unfettered access to all information and documentation for all survivors, victims and next of kin of residential care homes, including to their information andarchival documentation;- ensure hearings will include all Protestant mother and baby homes such as Bethany and Westbank mother and baby homes and all institutions, even if they are not included in the Government’s prescribed list;- preserve the documentation at the Magdalene laundry site in Donnybrook, which will be made available to survivors;- ensure representatives of the organisations responsible appear to provide testimony and answer questions in public;- provide, where necessary, legal representation for survivors, with costs being covered by the State;- as a matter of urgency, ensure that all mother and baby homes and county home sites are subject to an injunction preventing structural changes to or interference with land where exhumations may be necessary until the final report of the truth commission is published;- allow for the prevention of any interference with relevant sites and all ongoing work on these sites shall cease immediately to facilitate a thorough forensic inspection;- examine the circumstances of the women and children affected from a constitutional and human rights perspective, including the circumstances of exit for women and children, as well as consider related matters such as the forced labour taken from women, illegal adoptions, vaccine trials and any other such matter that thecommission sees as appropriate, taking the report of the interdepartmental group on mother and baby homes into account;- consider the manner in which women or children were placed in these institutions, the role the State had in placing them within these institutions and the responsibility it bears for the treatment and welfare of children more generally within these institutions;- have the power to compel witnesses to come before a truth commission;- publish a series of interim reports to Dáil Éireann, on a bi-monthly basis, on the progress of the truth commission and its recommendations regarding redress,identity and access to personal documents, responsibility of institutions, memorialisation, current welfare of survivors, access to courts and the Statute ofLimitations and all other information it considers relevant; and- ensure that the recommendations of the interim and final reports will be expedited as quickly as possible.I acknowledge the many survivors and their supporters in the Visitors Gallery and thank them for their attendance. Oscar Wilde once said the truth was rarely pure and never simple. It has been proved that it is not simple to find the truth on this issue. The intention of the motion before the House is to establish the truth and a process to do this - the truth that has long evaded survivors, been covered up and suppressed and still is to this day; the truth the victims and survivors of abuse by a number of institutions in the State deserve to have. The recent revelations at the Tuam Mother and Baby Home have only confirmed some of our deepest fears. The finding of human remains in what appeared to be mass graves came as a shock, but, unfortunately, in many ways, not a surprise. They have been followed by revelations of inconsistencies in records at Sean Ross Abbey, stories of malnutrition at Bessborough and concerns about the possibility that there are unmarked graves at any number of other locations around the country. People are angry and believe a severe injustice is certainly being done to those who were subjected to some brutal treatment over many decades, whether in mother and baby homes, county homes or Magdalen laundries. I should add that this did not happen just 60 or 70 years ago; it stretches back throughout the history of the State. These institutions were open up until the 1990s. It is not historical; there are all categories of women and children who are still with us. People are right to be angry and I am sure many representatives elected to this House have heard in the past few weeks both about the anger and sorrow felt by the wider public but particularly by those who were in the institutions. From my perspective which I think is shared by many of those involved, the State has only scratched the surface in the form of a commission of investigation into mother and baby homes which was announced two years ago last month. I do not diminish entirely some of the work the commission has done to date. I believe, however, that ultimately it was hamstrung from the very beginning. We said at the time and it has become increasingly apparent that it is not fit for purpose in its current form. It was set up in the midst of widespread criticism that its terms of reference and the model to be used were utterly inadequate. People who suffered under the system - it was a system, a regime - but not in places on the list of prescribed mother and baby homes were excluded. Survivor groups have also criticised the behind-closed-doors hearings because they believe there is a lack of transparency. There has also been a failure to recognise that, although the experiences of those who were in mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries and other institutions were varied and different, the issues are intrinsically linked. Many children who had their childhood snapped from them in mother and baby homes went on to have further engagement with both laundries and industrial schools, as did their mothers. The State and consecutive Governments continued with their departmentalised, atomised approach which was fragmented and illogical, as the crossover between the homes and institutions is enormous. I emphasise again that it was a regime underpinned by an appalling attitude towards women, particularly unmarried women and their children, which manifested itself across the institutions of the State. That point has been neglected in the contributions of Governments during the years. That is why we propose a radical new approach. We are proposing the establishment of a truth commission. It would draw on the best principles of international practice as seen in South Africa, Chile, Australia and Canada and adopt the best examples of that process here. Tá an cur chuige seo ag iarraidh aitheantas a thabhairt don idirdheighilt, agus don chodarsnacht, atá ann idir na gnéithe difriúla den chóras agus ag iarraidh rudaí a chur i gceart ó thaobh na héagóra a rinneadh ar go leor de na daoine seo agus solas a chur ar an gcóras ina iomlán. This model would ensure the voices of all survivors would be heard. Too many have been excluded. They would be heard in a way that would give them dignity and assure them that they could trust in the process. This is about transitional and transformative justice. I made a point about people being excluded. The State is involved in a court case in the High Court in which women who were in an industrial school but who were forced to provide labour for the Magdalen laundries were not included in the redress scheme, or at least the State is contesting that basis. There might have been exploited children in one place, but because of this, it is not adequate for the redress board. It is that separation and exclusion we need to resolve. I am anxious that survivor groups be consulted and a part of this process. I thank the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, for attending our vigil which was held just before this debate. However, it is my understanding the Taoiseach has not during the term of office of this or the last Government met groups of representatives of mother and baby homes. If that is the case, it must change. I read the amendments I received around 2 p.m., with dismay, although perhaps not shock. What I received were amendments that were lacking in thought and substance but also, to an extent, compassion. The suggestion from the Government, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party was that I delete my motion, practically in its entirety. What was submitted was insulting to those who sit here and further afield watching the debate, regardless of my anger. The Government's amendment is essentially a pat on the back for what it has done to date. What has been done to date in the setting up of a commission of investigation is wholly inadequate and falls far short of what is required in this instance. Fianna Fáil's amendment would remove the right of access to records for victims and survivors. This is a move that makes me wonder how much they have listened to the specific point about access to survivors' own testimonies, in particular. I have a quote from a survivor who has been through the process and presented to the commission: "I asked for my transcripts which detailed my full case submission, but these transcripts are being refused." If a truth commission was set up and survivors were given access to the transcripts, they would be able to give a copy to the new commission which would save time and avoid the need for them to relive the trauma.I think that is a reasonable point. If there is one thing survivors want, it is the right to their own identity, testimony and words, but that is seemingly not on Fianna Fáil's list of priorities. All that is contained in the amendment is a provision to establish a body to document survivors' stories. To a large extent, this is already being done by volunteers with Justice for Magdalenes. They cannot be commended enough for the great work they are doing in the absence of State support. The Labour Party's amendment was more conservative and elusive than the Minister's, which is quite disappointing. My party's motion is a genuine attempt to right the wrongs of the past and give a voice to those whose words have fallen on deaf ears for far too long. Members of this House should not be responsible for stifling the voices of these people. They should not confirm the already heightened suspicions of the general public that neither the Government nor the party holding it up have any credibility when it comes to dealing with this issue. A significant proposal contained in the motion is the requirement for an injunction to prevent any interference in any of the sites at mother and baby homes and county homes where there is any possibility that there are unmarked graves or where there is any requirement for investigations or exhumations. All ongoing work at those locations should cease immediately in order to facilitate thorough forensic inspection. This is a key point of our motion that I wish to emphasise to all those who tabled amendments. Given that this proposal is not included in the other amendments, I ask those Deputies to withdraw their amendments. We feel that the Sinn Féin motion is a progressive proposal which attempts to prevent a recurrence of many of the mistakes that have been made, such as the ones that happened in Tuam regarding the previous commission of investigation. I had hoped that this suggestion would be easily supported by all. It treats all these sites with the utmost respect and in some respects it errs on the side of caution due to the sensitivity of potential future investigations. The key point is that the process we are proposing is about tying all the different strands of the system together. It will thus shine a light on all aspects of that terrible episode in our history which is to the State's shame. It is also about ensuring that the experience of survivors in engaging with the State and its processes is accessible. They should feel comfortable with it and be able to engage with it on their own terms as well as trusting it. That has not been the case with the commission of investigation so far.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	354	I wish to commend my colleague, Deputy Ó Laoghaire, on tabling this motion and sharing his time. Sinn Féin is proposing that in light of the commission of investigation being deemed insufficient to deal with crucial issues in their entirety, that a truth commission be set up which would complement the work of the investigation. A truth commission would ensure that hearings included all mother and baby homes, such as Bethany and Westbank, as well as all institutions, even if they are not included in the Government's prescribed list. We know that the commission of investigation's terms of reference excluded many institutions and settings, including county homes and the Magdalen laundries. Neither is there any specific inclusion of children who were illegally adopted or illegally fostered. Our proposal is that such a commission would have a broad remit and that survivors in particular would have the ability to contribute publicly or privately in a manner of their choosing. Such a commission could hold individuals and institutions to account, apportion responsibility for mistreatment and neglect and make recommendations on redress. This Private Members' motion arose in response to the inadequate approach on the part of the State to all these interrelated issues. So many questions need to be answered. If genuine healing of survivors is to take place, then all those affected must be given an opportunity to have their voices heard if they so wish. As matters stand, this will not be possible under the existing terms of reference of the commission of investigation. We had a debate recently on the Grace commission and we were all shocked and horrified about things that went on. If we are genuine about redressing those matters and creating justice for people we must listen to the survivors who have come out of that system. If that is not happening, then we need to put a system in place so that it can occur. Some of these institutions existed until the 1990s and the effects of that can still be felt today. As was said during the debate on Grace, let us not be hypocritical in seeking to place this kind of abuse of women and children solely in a historical context. We cannot pretend that children being failed by the State is an unfamiliar idea in society today. Tragically, discriminatory treatment of women and children remains hugely prevalent and is still very much alive in our communities. Children continue to be failed terribly by the State. In the absence of a proper care system for children, the mistakes of the past are being repeated. We need only examine recent figures from the HSE and Tusla as a snapshot of our society's shameful treatment of children. Recent reports show that Tusla received 56,000 reports of child abuse in a recent three-year period. Unfortunately, given those statistics, I do not think we have learned anything from our history. The most recent report, published at the end of April 2015, indicated that there were 6,420 children in care, 93% of whom were placed in foster care. That is a shameful travesty but what is even more shameful is that we do not have a care system fit to provide the support desperately needed for these children. As we discuss the horrific abuses of the past, these figures represent today's reality. Yet what are we doing to safeguard children at risk? How much support do we give organisations such as the ISPCC which step in at weekends when the care system is not working due to cutbacks? While we are calling for a truth commission, I urge everyone to be cognisant of the issues right under our noses. We must learn from the tragedies of the past and vow to do everything we can to create a care system for children that will safeguard those in need. If this State does not wants to face the reality of a truth commission or another commission of investigation in ten or 20 years' time, we need to take heed now and make the safety of children at risk a priority. The survivor groups here today seek justice, clarity and recognition for what occurred and what they had to endure. It is only right that the State should enable that to happen after all they have been through. They are strong, resilient people who deserve the same respect and treatment offered to any other citizen. I therefore urge all Deputies to please support this motion so that we can begin that process of justice.

It was not just in the institutions because children were also sold, bartered and transported abroad on false documentation by the institutions of this State and neighbouring states. That happened because there was a moralistic attitude towards women. The most scandalous part is that for many years our society had this moralistic attitude. However, the hypocrites who gave that moral lesson to us all were the very ones who were bartering children, starving them and refusing them medical aid. In fact, they treated people as slaves. Thanks to the courage of those in the Visitors Gallery and others around the world who have come together to tell their stories, we are starting to listen for once. It is not good enough to just listen, however, because we must also learn from the mistakes of our past. The only way we can do that is if we establish the truth by listening to the stories of those on whom this society inflicted the horrors of these institutions. It is not just the institutions we have heard of in the media lately, but also other institutions whose secrets are still hidden from those who pass their doors every day. I know of one in Castlepollard where a memorial was promised to indicate some of the horrors that went on there. To date, however, that memorial has not been erected and, as a result, there is no sign to indicate what happened. Each one of us has heard stories from individual survivors of other institutions. Like others, I have encouraged those survivors to let the public know, thus relieving themselves of the hurt if at all possible. Some of them are not up to that task, however. They do not want to broadcast to the world what happened to them because some of them are still ashamed for no reason. It was no fault of their own.That is the fear that was wrought on them, day in and day out, in some of these institutions. There is a woman with whom I deal regularly who was sent to a special school for girls. She was brutalised day in and day out from the age of nine years until she left the school in Blackrock in this city at the age of 18. She can barely function in society today because of the horrors wrought on her. That same story has been replicated by others with whom I have dealt in the past and with whom I still deal to this day. They are the ones whose voices need to be heard. They also want society to listen to them and help them on the rest of their journey through life because many of them have been left with legacy issues, including health, mental health and education issues, which have not been addressed. The first part of addressing it is for society as a whole to admit to its failings and the torture it put these women and children through. Their families on the outside were also often left distressed. Those who are guilty of engaging in these barbaric practices must then suffer some consequences. Whether it should be just ignominy or more is not for me to say, but the victims and survivors need to be heard. Their voices need to be broadcast to the world and future generations in order that we will not repeat the mistakes or actions of the past, in particular towards women and children. The hypocrites who ran these institutions claimed to be Christian. The actions about which we have heard in Tuam, in particular, were not Christian. Some of those who claimed to be our moral masters are now, thankfully, being exposed for the hypocrites that they were.

and- the plight of Irish women and children who were in institutions in this country in the last century, equally affirms their resilience and agency as survivors and stands in solidarity with all former residents, their loved ones and campaigners;agrees that the commission must be given the opportunity to complete its sensitive and person-centred investigations in the public interest to establish the facts of what happened in and around these homes and to issue its report in accordance with the legal framework under which it was established;further notes the co-ordinated approach by Government Departments and agencies to respond to the discovery of human remains in Tuam and to engage with the local community and other parties with family connections in a sensitive and inclusive manner, recognising the dignity and equality to which all stakeholders are entitled;further recognises that:- the independent commission has the scope and power to examine a broad range of public concerns in relation to these institutions, to make a determination on their relevance to the central issues in question, and to make any recommendations to the Government which the commission deems appropriate;- the commission’s terms of reference provide for a confidential committee forum to facilitate former residents of these Homes which may wish to provide accounts of their experience and to assist the commission to ground its work in the reality of the experience of mothers and children;- a commission of investigation’s legal framework allows it to hold hearings in public where this would be in the interests of the investigation and fair procedures;- major investigations have already been conducted into historical child abuse by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse which had a wide remit to inquire into the abuse of children in any place where children were cared for other than as members of their families; and- the report of the interdepartmental committee into Magdalen laundries established the facts of State involvement with the laundries under the supervision of an independent chairperson;further agrees that the three reports of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters which are due for completion by February 2018, namely, the social history report, the confidential committee report and the investigative report, are critically important in coming to terms with how Irish society responded to vulnerable single women and their children at a time when they most needed our support and assistance; andwelcomes the intention of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to:- examine the potential for a gender-sensitive transitional justice approach, to facilitate former residents of institutions who may wish to provide accounts of theirexperiences in public or in private, with a view to formally acknowledging and validating their experiences, and supporting reconciliation for former residents andthe public at large with the events of the past by enhancing public awareness and understanding of a range of past abuses and human rights failures;- explore the potential for the application of a range of transitional justice mechanisms that would acknowledge and preserve the accounts of the past that have emerged in Tuam and elsewhere, honouring the accounts of victims by preserving memory, undoing stigma and honouring the lives of those who were residents of such homes, thereby guaranteeing non-repetition and affirming the dignity and equality values of the Constitution of Ireland;- explore, in the context of these transitional justice measures, the scope for a truth commission which would examine broad societal issues of collective responsibility in this area and which would complement but be distinct from the work of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Relate Matters;- carry out a scoping exercise to consider the calls for an extension to the terms of reference of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters; and- expedite the publication of the second interim report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters.I thank the Ceann Comhairle, Deputies, survivors, families, supporters and friends who are here. We cannot discuss truth and finding it without acknowledging the role of the late Mr. Martin McGuinness in the recent history of the country. As a champion of reconciliation, he was an example of how we can and should confront dark, uncomfortable and difficult chapters of our history. As a proud son of the Bogside, he has left a legacy of peace which will benefit many generations on this island. He worked tirelessly to bring about reconciliation and build bridges which, in the not too distant past, none of us could have imagined. I extend my deep sympathy to his family, his many friends across all political divides and, of course, his party colleagues. I always felt privileged to receive his empowering embrace each time I met him. With his example in our thoughts, let us discuss the difficult issues before us. I welcome the opportunity to deal further with the issue of mother and baby homes. It is less than a month since the commission of investigation confirmed the discovery of the remains of babies and children on the site in Tuam. Together, we have been coming to terms with the news, as a community, as a people and as a nation. What has been found in the County Galway town has brought into the open a broader tapestry of harm experienced by women and children across the island for decades. Let me stress that it is important that we do not state or act in any way which would undermine the ongoing work of the commission of investigation. This House approved its establishment and we must let it get on with its work. There should be no confusion about its role and no duplication of its important work. Deputies will be aware that, as a life-long campaigner, a feminist and an Independent Minister, I have highlighted the need to look beyond the important legal questions surrounding mother and baby homes. We must look to have a more holistic approach to grasp the truth of what happened in our country. We must do justice to the past, while, at the same time, ensuring processes are in place to ensure such practices will never re-emerge in the future. As a people, we have an obligation to remember, to tell the history that was buried in the ground and to say simply and absolutely "never again". The best way to proceed is through consensus. It is important that our future actions acknowledge the fact that, despite our political differences, we all stand united on the fundamental commitment to ensure the equality and dignity of all. The counter motion before the House commits to truth recovery. Of course, this is not the domain of any single political party but is owned by all. Human dignity is at the very heart of the Constitution and equally reflected in the human rights treaties we have signed and ratified. Unfortunately, we have not lived up to these values and there is much work ahead to redeem and give meaning to them. That brings me to the question of how best we can do this. Calls for the establishment of a truth commission are in line with and echo the approach I outlined to the House as one possible approach just two weeks ago. However, I have significant concerns that the motion put forward seems to ignore almost entirely the work the mother and baby homes commission of investigation was established two years ago to do. It also takes a narrow view of the complex truth and reconciliation demands which follow the violation of human rights. Before deciding on any future course of action, it is important to restate our continued support for the existing commission which must be allowed to continue its work. To that end, I remind Deputies of the considerable breath and scope of its terms of reference. They include the right to seek an extension of its terms of reference, its work of listening to victims and survivors in a safe and supported context, as well as the scale of its fact-finding work. When the commission was set up, this House approved the proposal that it have both a confidential committee, to which former residents could tell their story, and a social history module which would help us to understand the context and reality of the times. Both elements will be important in deepening our understanding of what happened and what were the lived experiences of mothers and their children. It is open to the commission to hold hearings in public, if it so decides. The confidential committee was designed for those who wanted to tell their experiences in private, away from the public gaze, but it is worthwhile pointing out that the commission could conduct some of its business in public, if it decides that it is in the public interest to do so. Any such decision would, of course, be entirely for the commission to make.  The commission is two years into a three-year programme of work. To take actions now which would double up, devalue or undermine these important tasks would be ill-conceived and wrong. Having said that, an holistic approach does allow space for a complementary body of work, a wider truth recovery process. In the short few weeks since the commission's update on events in Tuam, I have begun a process of consultation on how this work could proceed. I have met academics here and in Boston; historians, including Catherine Corless; investigative journalists and recognised experts in the area of transitional justice. That dialogue is continuing. Together, we have been looking at the challenge ahead and how we can learn from similar exercises in other jurisdictions. Truth recovery and acknowledgement of harm at individual, institutional and national level require patience. It is important that we commit to processes of substance, integrity and expertise. The counter motion reflects these requirements. The discussions I have had with experts in this field and survivors, including some of those who attended the vigil this evening, have raised important points and questions. I would like to share some of these reflections with colleagues. It is considered that for truth recovery to succeed, it must not be a one-size-fits-all truth commission. There can be many approaches to achieve our desired goal. Existing mechanisms, investigations and reports can form part of a broader process. It also allows for the maximising of resources and expertise. It can have different elements, providing for access to and the compilation of archives, public installations, victim and survivor-led dialogue and testimonies which can be just as powerful as commissions, inquiries and investigations. We must also learn from those reconciliation and truth exercises which have failed and in particular those in which the harms being addressed were gendered harms. Our commitment must be to do better than that. To put it plainly, for survivors and for future generations, we cannot afford to get this wrong. Any process which is embarked upon must fulfil a number of criteria, the most important being the support and empowerment of victims and survivors. Truth recovery must also have the ability to hear the totality of the story - the structural oppression of poverty, the prevailing moral norms and the devaluing of some children's lives compared with others. If we are to confront and deal with our history in an open and honest way, then these are the elements which must be included. My discussions have also put a spotlight on a number of important issues which must be addressed. The difficulty which survivors, their representatives and historians in this area have in accessing records is disconcerting. I am mindful too that many survivors and the loved ones of those who have passed are elderly and want answers. The questions and issues before us are complex and will need proper consideration. There cannot be a rush to action. To get this wrong now not only runs the risk of undermining work which has already been carried out. It could jeopardise our shared desire to reach the truth - the whole truth. I look forward to this evening's contributions. I have already listened carefully to the first three. As someone who spoke in this House about the need for a process of truth, transitional justice and a learning to protect future generations, I welcome this further conversation. We have much to atone for as a society. We must do so collectively with commitment and generosity of spirit and in a genuine desire for reconciliation not only with those whom we have harmed but with ourselves. Truth redeems us all and allows for the space to reclaim the dignity we value so highly. In his poem "Clearances", writing of his mother, Seamus Heaney speaks of "a soul ramifying and forever Silent, beyond silence listened for". As we move into the future, we are compelled to listen to the silence and to open up our hearts and minds to the pain that will undoubtedly follow. This amendment sketches some of the key principles and elements of such a future path.

I thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire for moving the motion. It is a conversation we need to have. What has been put before us has us back in the Chamber again to discuss this matter. We were here less than a month ago after the revelations about Tuam. "Shocked", "horrified" and "dismayed" are some of the words we would use to describe what came before us. Coming from east Galway, I was bitterly hurt, upset and disappointed for the residents, the survivors, the mothers, the babies, those who were adopted, those who died, those who were fostered, those who lived nearby and those who live in Tuam and surrounding areas. It was a poor reflection on the people from Tuam and was not a true reflection of them. While we agree in principle with the establishment of a truth commission, my party and I believe the Sinn Féin motion is premature. While in principle we are not against a truth commission, the best model would have to be agreed, should only be done following consultation with the survivors and various groups representing survivors and cannot usurp the current commission of inquiry. We have a number of concerns about the Sinn Féin motion. In the first instance, the motion does not acknowledge or affirm the ongoing commission of inquiry. The commission of inquiry needs to be able to complete its work. While imperfect, it is an important process that is making strong progress towards investigating and documenting the historical abuse and wrongdoing that took place in the mother and baby homes. With this in mind, we are bringing forward an amendment that seeks to establish a truth commission that will complement the work of the ongoing commission of inquiry and be guided by survivors' wishes and needs. I wholeheartedly agree that this is a conversation that needs to happen. We need to plan for future needs. If we are to be true to all women and children born in the mother and baby homes and similar institutions, it should be open and non-prescriptive. If I have an issue with the Sinn Féin motion, it is that it is too prescriptive. It is so set in stone that there is no room for inclusion, expansion and contribution because this is what we need. Deputy Funchion was so right. We have to learn from the past, the Grace case and all these other cases, because if we do not learn, the same thing will happen repeatedly. This is why thousands of cases of abuse are before Tusla at this time. I certainly do not want that on my watch. What I do want on my watch is to push forward a truth commission. I wholeheartedly believe that if we were to come together as a group, do what the Minister says and work through consensus, we will get there with a truth commission. We need to include everyone. This includes all parliamentarians here. It includes not just mother and baby homes but all survivors from institutions and all children, be they fostered or adopted. We need their input. It cannot be a case of one party taking ownership. We must all work together for the people in the Public Gallery and those who represent people who are too shy and too withdrawn to come forward, because there is a serious amount of hurt, grief, anger and upset and people want answers. The one part of the motion that I liked was that we would look at the oldest people first. If we are to go forward with the truth commission, people have the right to closure and answers. I hear what Sinn Féin is saying about my party's amendment, which leaves out what the Sinn Féin motion says about not having access to documents. There are two sides to this. Some people have walked away from that part of their lives and have closed the door. They have put on a mask and have dealt with it. They have the right to a choice when it comes to the disclosure of their documents. Sinn Féin Deputies are right when they say that people who make contributions to committees or the commission of inquiry should have access to what has been documented, but the only way we are going to address all of this is by saying that we want an expansion of the current commission of investigation. We need to establish a truth commission. We need to bring what we want to the one table. Looking at the motion and amendments before us, it is certain that we all want the truth. We all want to do the right thing by the survivors and those mothers. Most importantly, when history is being written, we certainly do not want to see a repeat of what happened in the past. We need to learn from that and to acknowledge that it was a dark time in history. Let us not repeat it. I would like to see consensus and all of us working together. I support the Minister in that I would like to see the current commission of inquiry complete its work. I would like to see that interim report appear.I would like to see that the commission is working in a timely manner and that it is getting answers and will provide the people with Tuam the answers they require because they still do not have them. All they know is that a significant number of bodies were found. We need to know about DNA. The survivors and many others have so many questions and we need answers to those questions. If we do everything in a timely manner, people will be able to draw support and comfort from the fact that the commission of investigation is working in their best interests and will deliver results. These results will say in time that we learned. That is the most important thing for us to take from this. We must learn. It is awfully important too to reflect on the survivors. That we are opening such wounds must be so harsh. It must be such a struggle for them. Day in, day out we are discussing these people. The last time I spoke in the Dáil, I said that it was not just women and babies from Tuam that we need to discuss. This did not just happen in Tuam. It happened throughout the country. We need to see the commission of investigation's remit expanded. My party will wholeheartedly support its expansion. The church has a role to play. This has been documented very well in the media recently. I will not get into it now but there is a whole scope of works there. The amendment I have tabled to the motion addresses establishing the truth and giving people an opportunity. The most important people are the mothers, the babies and the survivors, young and old, who survived in those institutions. They have a story to tell and it must be listened to. I commend my amendment to the motion to the House.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	358	Fianna Fáil welcomed the commission on mother and baby homes when it was established. That position has not changed. We recognise the vital importance of the commission in delivering justice and accountability for all those affected by mother and baby homes in Ireland. The most important focus are the mothers and their babies. These mothers, babies and families must come first. They must be our sole focus. In the Fianna Fáil amendment, we recognise the considerable harms that have been experienced by survivors of mother and baby homes and similar institutions. The absolute shock and horror of seeing the names - like a roll call - of the 796 babies buried in the mother and baby home in Tuam is incomprehensible. A total of 796 babies, aged between 35 weeks and 3 years, were buried. Some were buried in graves but most were buried in septic tanks. It is hard to even say the words. These children died of whooping cough, bronchitis, pneumonia and malnutrition. Imagine a baby dying of hunger. It is so hard to take. Mothers and babies were separated at birth. They were torn apart. Some were adopted and sent to America for a better life - we hope. Last week, when reading an article in one of the Sunday newspapers, I was struck by the report of two children who were born in the Tuam mother and baby home in 1960. One was adopted in America and lived a good life. He was well educated and happy. They tried to adopt the girl at the same time. However, they could not do it financially. The girl did not have a good life. In fact, she had a very sad and horrendous life. This goes to show how the dice rolled for those two children. One had an exceptionally good life and the other did not. These babies, mothers and families need the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes to complete its work in a timely fashion. These mothers need the truth. They need to know why their babies died. If their babies were adopted, they need to know what happened to them. They need closure. These women, siblings and families need to know what happened. For too long, the first thing they thought of every morning and the last thing they thought of every night was what happened to their babies. I believe a truth commission is necessary and our amendment to the motion seeks to establish a truth commission in a manner that complements and does not infringe on the ongoing commission of investigation. This would be done in co-operation with survivor groups to ensure that the truth commission is solely focused on the needs of survivors, who have to come first. I cannot emphasise enough that the survivors must come first. The truth commission needs to be established in line with international best practice, and must be guided by similar commissions in South Africa, Chile and Canada. The views and experiences of all survivors of mother and baby homes must be listened to, respected and acknowledged. We need to bring healing and reconciliation to survivor communities, the broader public and the State. We must ensure that the stories and experiences of these women and children are not forgotten and that their memory is honoured in a respectful way. Before we can move forward as a nation, we must turn to the past and recognise its implications for today.

When we are faced with the excavation of hundreds of infant remains from a tiny plot in Tuam, we are faced with a legacy that will echo in our consciences and the conscience of the State and our ancestors forever. Twelve months ago, we proudly echoed and repeated the 1916 Proclamation point of treating children equally. The events of the past number of weeks have made it difficult to make sense of that. The religious institutions of the State did so well in areas such as education. My generation understands that they educated the poor and impoverished at a time when education was not as accessible as it is today. However, it is getting harder for the younger generation to have the same understanding when all they have heard over the past number of years about the church is stories of sexual immorality. Now they hear this. Throughout a certain period, the church excelled in certain areas of society. However, when it came to protecting the most vulnerable and showing human compassion, it has been found badly wanting. I believe there is something different about the scenario we have seen over the past number of weeks. There is something different about hundreds of infants and babies - citizens of this State - being found in unmarked graves and septic tanks. This reverberates over all that has gone on before. We can no longer use the excuse that our ancestors were ignorant as to what was going on. They were part of society during this time. There was a certain truth in the Taoiseach's words when he said that no one was ever kidnapped but there is a duty on this generation to ask why. We need to explore fully all legacies. This means that placing the blame at the door of religious organisations is but one part of the redemption process. In my county of Cork, there have been calls in recent days to excavate the grounds of the mother and baby home at Bessborough. I do not have an answer as to whether this should be done or not. However, if excavating bones such as in Tuam is a matter of giving the truth to those who seek it and have suffered so much, it needs to be seriously considered and all remains found given a decent Christian burial, as is right. That much they deserve.

In recent weeks, we celebrated our national day in Ireland and across the world and gloried in all of our successes and achievements but the Tuam baby scandal reminds us of a dark chapter in our history and how inhumane our country's history is. In this case, the past is truly another country but we must acknowledge and learn and we must honour the memory of those who died. We must ensure a proper child protection environment for our children and we must honour and respect our survivors.Fianna Fáil recognises the vital importance of the commission in delivering justice and accountability for all of those who have been affected. The commission must be able to complete its work of investigating and documenting the abuses and wrongdoing. Many survivors have awaited a report on this matter for decades and we must prioritise the timely completion of the commission's report.  I support the amendment tabled by my colleague, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, which proposes to establish a truth commission in co-operation with survivors groups that would complement the ongoing commission of investigation.  This week, with international mother's day approaching on Sunday, we must remember those mothers who gave birth but never got to be mothers or to love and cherish their children, see them grow up and share in the joys of their lives. Shame on all the men who fathered those children and walked away.

Some of us had an opportunity to debate this matter two weeks ago and it will be on the agenda again tomorrow. The House must collectively try to figure out the best way to get to the truth of what occurred in mother and baby homes. None of us has a monopoly of wisdom in this regard. All of those who drafted amendments to the motion have tried to work towards the best way to approach this issue. I will move an amendment on behalf of the Labour Party. I agree that we must first ensure the commission does its work and my party's amendment refers to the commission for this reason. The amendment also provides that the Minister will publish the interim report. I note she has given a commitment to do so, although it has not yet been published. It is also essential that the terms of reference of the commission are expanded because it is not adequate to cover only 14 mother and baby homes and four county homes. Many people living among us have experience of other homes in other locations that are not included in the list. Many were born in institutions that are not on the list. For this reason, our amendment prioritises publishing the interim report and expanding the commission's terms of reference.  In terms of getting to the truth, we need to focus on the work of Catherine Corless. Ms Corless, through unstinting and determined research, found death certificate after death certificate and kept digging until she was able to expose to all of us at least some of the truth of what happened in just one mother and baby home, namely, the Tuam home. Bessborough mother and baby home is another institution that has been cited but there must be similar stories in other parts of the country. We must shine a light on all of them because if we do not do so, we will not have the full truth we all seek.  We must ensure the people who went to mother and baby homes or were born in them are the first priority in terms of consultation. The Minister referred to consultation with academics, historians, recognised experts in transitional justice and others. She also indicated she had consulted survivors and people who had personal experience of the awful hurt imposed by society on the women in question and their children. The most important persons in all of this are the women and children who were affected. Irrespective of whether a truth commission or another forum is established to address this issue, the views of the women and children who experienced the mother and baby homes must be afforded greater importance than those of anyone else. What happened to the babies must also be central to the commission's work. We know there was malnutrition, children were not properly fed and mortality rates among children in mother and baby homes were much higher than among children of similar ages in Ireland at the time. We also know the children in these homes were used as guinea pigs in vaccine trials and that illegal adoptions took place. However, we do not know the full truth in respect of any of these issues, all of which must be examined.  I do not know if a truth commission is the correct approach. There are different versions of the role of a truth commission. I am particularly concerned that a truth commission could in some way delay the work being done by the commission, which must be the priority. I am also concerned that such a commission could delay justice. As previous speakers noted, many of those who experienced mother and baby homes are getting on in life and some may wish to seek justice in the courts. We must not place obstacles in their way. Having said that, I do not object to the concept of a truth commission, although, as I stated, I do not know exactly what it would entail. While the term "truth commission" slips off the tongue easily, what precisely does it involve? The commission to inquire into child abuse, for example, sat for a number of years and held private and public hearings at which people told their stories. As my party's spokesperson on the issue at the time, I met many survivors who were involved in that process. Some viewed the commission as positive because it allowed them to deal with their experience, while others believed it did not help them. We need to learn from all of that in deciding what type of forum we will establish.  The Minister cited the words of Seamus Heaney, which called to mind the words written by Leonard Cohen:There is a crack in everything, That's how the light gets in. We must recognise the large cracks in our past and present by letting in the light. Leonard Cohen is a good example of someone who had great compassion for people who had been hurt by life and had to deal with all kinds of difficulties. We must take a similar compassionate approach. While I agree with Deputy Ó Laoghaire that compassion is essential, on its own, it is not what people want. They want to ensure that everything that happened to them is exposed, that they have a say and that there is some way they can get truth and justice in so far as that can be achieved. Achieving justice may be difficult because one cannot give people back their lives or babies. However, we have to reach conclusions that will reflect the best we can do at this stage.  I also agree with Deputies Funchion, Rabbitte and others that we must learn from the past by providing proper protection for children who are in vulnerable circumstances. While this issue is about the past, it is also very much about building a structure for the future that protects children, particularly the most vulnerable children.

#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	363	An article in The Daily Telegraph in 2014 cited the words of Christy, who was adopted from the Bessborough mother and baby home in Cork.My arms and legs were very badly scarred. But when I asked my mum why, she basically said when you arrived your arms were very sore and they were bandaged. I didn't know anything about vaccination trials. I've since been to a few doctors and they said they'd never seen anything like it - with so many injections.Christy is just one of thousands of Irish children born or living in institutions who were used as guinea pigs provided by the religious orders for vaccine trials by the pharmaceutical industry. The big beneficiary of these trials was British pharmaceutical giant, Burroughs Wellcome and Company, as it was at the time, which is today known as GlaxoSmithKline, the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world, which had market capitalisation of Stg£81 billion as of August 2016, making it the fourth largest company on the London Stock Exchange. The company earned Stg£21.3 billion in 2013 from vaccines and drugs. Between 1960 and 1976 alone, more than 298 children across ten mother and baby homes, including Bessborough, were subject to experimental vaccine trials.  Over a period of almost 50 years, there were trials involving thousands of children, some of whom were mentally and physically disabled. This included children from dozens of institutions. Where was the consent? Some of the children grew up not realising for more than 30 years that they had been involved in these trials. The victims contacted their natural mothers. All the mothers contacted of whom we know said they had not been asked for permission. In 1962, the British Medical Journal seemed to confirm that parental permission was not sought when it said, "We are indebted to the medical officers in charge of the children's homes for permission to carry out this investigation on infants under their care". Consent was not a new concept in 1960-61. In 1947, the Nuremberg Code, which was developed as a result of the prosecution of Nazi doctors involved in experimenting on humans, stressed the need for the consent of subjects in clinical trials but here children were used as guinea pigs with no respect for their bodily integrity, treated differently from other citizens and, indeed, treated as lesser citizens. Changes were made to the 1960 and 1961 files under the control of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary in 2002 just weeks after they received a discovery order from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Admission and discharge dates for the mothers were altered because the original files would have shown they were not present to give their consent to these trials. We will support the motion. It proposes a stronger, more comprehensive approach than that outlined by the Government, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party. The mother and baby homes commission of inquiry has an interim report due at the end of the month. Has the commission called in representatives of GlaxoSmithKline and questioned them on their company's role in these events? In conclusion, I would like to correct the record of the House on a matter relating to this subject. Speaking in a debate on the mother and baby homes on 9 March, I reported on a conversation I had with a survivor of the homes in 2010. I mistakenly stated that the gentleman concerned had been born in Bessborough whereas on checking I realised he had been born in the Castlepollard home and had investigated Bessborough later in his life as an adult. I ask that this correction be duly noted.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	364	The motion is comprehensive, well thought out and ticks every box in terms of how the victims and survivors of this terrible debacle should be dealt with and how we try to get at the truth. I note with interest the reference to South Africa, Chile, Australia and Canada. These states secretly carried out butchery and genocide and engaged in cruelty against generations of people. The same description could be applied to the mother and baby homes on the basis of the information we have as of now. However, we have to get at the truth. In the case of South Africa under the apartheid regime, Chile under Pinochet and the treatment of the native peoples of Canada and Australia, the truth commissions examined something that was over. In the case of Ireland, the abuses of the church and State against people, given the control of the religious and the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, is not over. They are being maintained and we need to know more than what Sinn Féin is suggesting. I back the motion fully but I would like to amend it to state that what we say matters but what we do matters even more. To that end, I echo calls made by former Minister for Health, Deputy Micheál Martin, the current Minister for Health and by myself previously that the religious orders who dominated the State and who still dominate our health and education services be called in. My amendment calls for three steps to be taken. I am calling for all necessary steps to be taken, and not to break the law by, first, rescinding the so-called Woods deal which indemnified all the churches and religious orders in 2002 under the congressional indemnity agreement; second, taking all the necessary steps to take into public ownership hospitals controlled by religious orders, including the Bon Secours, which is a private group, St. Vincent's Hospital and the Mater Hospital; and, third, beginning the process of the separation of church and State finally by removing the control of religious orders over the boards of management of our schools and hospitals. A total of 95% of our national schools are controlled by religious orders and a newspaper reported yesterday that six of the Dublin hospitals controlled by religious orders have wealth approaching €1 billion. We all know how little the churches paid back in restitution for the abuse. If we want to honour the legacy of those mothers and babies and address the terrible crimes committed against them, we have to begin to unravel where the crimes stem from by pulling up everything root and branch and, therefore, making a huge commitment to the separation of church and State. That is the amendment I would like to make to a well thought out motion, which deserves to be considered, rather than the Minister's amendment, which says we should leave this alone and wait until the commission reports. It is like telling me when I introduced a Bill to reduce the 14-year sentence relating to abortion not to change the law until we hear back from the Citizens Assembly. Things can be done in tandem rather than waiting.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	365	I thank Sinn Féin for the opportunity to contribute to the debate, although I do not support it, and I will try to clarify why. The motion is not appropriate at the moment, given there is a commission of investigation, and we should use our combined strength to change its terms of reference to force accountability in respect of the interim report that is sitting on a desk since September 2016 without an explanation as to what is going on. We should listen to the survivors and the families, including my own, which have been deeply and personally affected by the mother and baby homes scandal. The Minister quoted Heaney and, while he is one of my favourite poets and normally I would delight in hearing his poetry quoted anywhere, I would have preferred if she had quoted some of the survivors or from the briefing document prepared in October 2012 by officials in the Department of Health highlighting serious concerns relating to patient ill-health and the safety of babies in the mother and baby homes in Tuam and Bessborough, the possible alteration of birth and death certificates and other matters in the context of the Martin McAleese report. They said they did not have the wherewithal to investigate these issues. That is one of many briefing documents. We do not know how many and, while I accept the Minister's bona fides, my confidence in them has been stretched a little, notwithstanding that she inherited the situation.It has certainly been stretched by the Minister's failure to publish the interim report. I wish that is what we were discussing in the Dáil with a view to having an influence on the terms of reference, the scoping extension the Minister has spoken about and so on. Now we are talking about a truth commission rather than forcing accountability in the ongoing process. One of the serious failures I have seen in the Dáil in my time and prior to it is its utter failure to hold the system to account. It is a point repeated ad nauseam by judges when they are put in charge of tribunals. They have repeatedly said if politicians asked questions and demanded answers, we would not need as many tribunals. Here we have a commission of inquiry with an interim report that has not been published and there is no excuse for that. It is appalling. Then there is a statement from the Minister saying we are coming to terms with the news as a community, a people and as a nation. I will try to stay away from the personal but as someone who is affected, we are coming to terms not with what happened but with the continual hiding of it by successive Governments and institutions. I have highlighted one briefing document that has not been referred to by the Minister or anybody in the Government and asked why it was not acted upon.  The issue of vaccine trials has been highlighted. It was highlighted in the commission into child abuse and, unfortunately, there was a judicial review to stop because the tribunal was acting outside its terms of reference. No Government has gone back to look at that. Once again, it was left.  I have asked repeatedly for a number of things in the current inquiry. I have asked that the site in Tuam be sealed off forensically and held. I have asked that other sites be looked at. I have asked that the time for the current commission be extended to allow more people to come forward in view of what was confirmed in Tuam. I do not say "discovered" because Catherine Corless highlighted this two years ago. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was certainly aware of it from the many people who came forward and gave testimony. The Martin McAleese interdepartmental inquiry was fully aware of what was going on in the mother and baby homes so none of this comes as a shock. The shock is the continued cover-up. As someone who has been affected, I am not looking for reconciliation at this point for me. The survivors who are struggling gallantly to survive have not asked for reconciliation. What they have asked for is to be treated with dignity and respect and to be given maximum information. The Minister talks about empowering and I take it at face value. Survivors are empowered by being given maximum information. That is not happening. We have somebody down in the High Court currently looking for records. He had to go to the High Court to force a situation to get information about his sister. All of this is on the public record. When we see death certificates for places like the mother and baby home in Tuam, we cannot rely on them. The briefing document from October 2012 told us there was a serious possibility that those death certificates had been tampered with. Are we to mourn for those who are related to us who are supposedly buried in chambers in the mother and baby home in Tuam, in Bessborough and elsewhere? Are we to go and look to see if they have been adopted in America through illegal adoptions? The briefing document highlights that babies were shipped to America and many other countries. There were treble payments made to the mother and baby homes. The two that are cited are Bessborough and Tuam. There were payments by the mother, the State and the adoptive parents in America who were waiting for the children they were going to adopt to come over. All of this has been set out. None of it is new. Not one single piece of it is new. If the Minister is seriously interested in a new regime, openness and accountability, let us stop issuing statements that she will talk to the historians, academics and advocates and let us make a statement that we will listen to the survivors and families in the first instance. Will the Minister please stand up in the Dáil and account for why the report has not been published? Will she commit to a full and frank debate about that report as soon as it is published and confirm tonight the date of the publication of that report? That is what openness and accountability mean, at least to me. It is the least the survivors deserve.  I will finish by paying tribute to Mary Raftery whose name is not heard often enough in the Dáil. She died prematurely on 10 January 2012. She did extraordinary work in "States of Fear" back in 1999, in her book Suffer the Little Children and in "Cardinal Secrets". That woman exposed more in Ireland and forced more inquiries than the Dáil, which should have forced the situation.  In case anybody here forgets, let me finally quote the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Education and Science, Batt O'Keeffe, who said in September 2009 the Magdalen women were not entitled to redress from the State as the State "did not refer individuals nor was it complicit in referring individuals" to the Magdalen laundries. That was and remains the level of denial in this country. The McAleese report was forced by the then Irish Human Rights Commission, which did its own report. If the Minister has heard what I said and is truly interested in being open and accountable, let us start by confirming the date and by confirming there will be an open discussion with the view to looking at a commission of inquiry but first by extending the terms of the current inquiry.

With the indulgence of the Ceann Comhairle, I will say a few words on that. I hope the people from Tuam and others will not mind. I did not get an opportunity today. We cannot discuss, as the Minister said, the finding of the truth without acknowledging the role of Martin McGuinness in the recent history of our country. We certainly cannot. Regardless of our political loyalties, we all owe a debt of gratitude to Martin McGuinness for his part in delivering the legacy of the Good Friday Agreement. A generation of young Irish have come of age never having known the awful and terrible violence of the Northern conflict, thanks in large part to the political and personal courage he displayed. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis. In my remarks on this matter previously, I made the point that we all have been deeply disturbed by the events in Tuam. Our hearts have been touched by the thought that so many children could have ended their lives in an environment that may have neglected or abandoned them when they were most in need of help. There is no defending or excusing what is absolutely indefensible. It is a source of shame that so many of our nation's children died in that way and continue to die through various forms of abuse. The State is complicit in the deaths and maltreatment of these children and their families. This is not yesterday's problem. It is not a problem we have left behind. We continue to practice with horrifying regularity the betrayal of children and their families. It was only five years ago that a report reviewed the deaths of almost 200 children who died either in the care of the State or who were known to the State's care services from 2002 to 2012. Tuam horrifies us. It causes us all dismay and bewilderment how such practices could be carried out.Where was the accountability? There was none. Where is it now, for that matter? Has anyone in the HSE or Tusla been held responsible for the neglect that led to 112 unnatural deaths of children between 2002 and 2012? I see merit in a truth commission being established but it must be a search for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It cannot descend into blanket condemnations. It must not create more divisions than it seeks to heal. Its work must be done responsibly and with appropriate caution. It must not become a State monopoly on the truth. All of the voices of Tuam must be heard and the question of responsibility addressed. I have accepted the Minister's bona fides on several issues since her appointment. I welcome her openness, frankness and freshness that she brings to her position and her forthright responses on many issues. Dealing with this and many other issues will be difficult but I have asked the Minister previously to address ongoing situations. One response to a recent parliamentary question that I asked brought up a fact about the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, which was before the Minister was in power, although she was a Senator of some renown at that point. More than 18,000 cases of child abuse were reported in each of those years to the various bodies over which she now has control. We all must reflect on that. Despite all of the education, so-called learning, experience, legislation, Children First policies and so on, this was happening under our noses. It was close to me, close to us all, and happening daily. I am sure that the 2016 figures, which were not available when I asked my question, will not be much better. Soul searching as well as a truth commission on Tuam is needed. There must be accountability on the part of the agencies that are charged with looking after our children in the face of such a shocking state of affairs.

He did a great deal of good for many people. I was glad to have met him again recently. It seems like it was only the other day that he attended a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. He came across the hallway, shook hands with me, smiled and congratulated me on getting elected and becoming a Member of Dáil Éireann. Regarding the matter under discussion, every man and woman is outraged about what has been made known about Tuam and what happened to so many small babies in that mother and baby home as well as other homes, institutions and laundries throughout the country. People want to know what happened. Were these children starved? How were they treated when they got sick? If they had something that was contagious, were they kept away from the rest of the children? The good, honest people want to know whether anyone can be brought to account for the wrongs that were done to so many children and young women. Deputies should not be haggling over which amendment to support. The Garda has a role to play in getting to the truth to ensure everything about what happened to the victims is made clear and, if possible, all the survivors are compensated properly. This is a sad saga in our history. It was considered shameful for an unmarried girl to become pregnant, requiring her to disappear from view locally into what was known as a mother and baby home or an industrial school. All Deputies should ensure the Garda is doing what it should do, that is, investigate and bring people to account where possible. We must work together to ensure all those who were wronged in these homes and institutions and are still alive get some form of redress or compensation.

Gabhaim mo bhuíochas as ucht an deis chun labhairt ar an rún fíorthábhachtach seo anocht. I commend my colleagues, Deputies Ó Laoghaire and Funchion, on their work on this serious issue, which is one that needs to be resolved. The people in question need closure in their lives. I commend Deputy Ó Laoghaire on tabling the motion, which I hope all parties will support. Every Deputy has been shocked by the recent revelations about the Tuam mother and baby home, just as we have been disgusted by the treatment of women in the Magdalen laundries and institutions run by the State. The commission of investigation into the mother and baby homes has been set up in the midst of widespread criticism of its inadequate terms of reference. Sinn Féin has tabled numerous amendments and strenuously voiced its concerns about the terms of reference, yet these have gone ignored. Those who suffered in the system but were not at the listed mother and baby homes have been excluded. Survivors' groups have criticised the behind closed doors hearings and the perceived lack of transparency. This motion seeks to establish a truth commission that would allow for the voices of all victims and survivors to be heard in public or private, whichever the individual wishes. At the end of the day, it is these people who need to be consulted. Their voices must be listened to and respected. The truth commission will build and expand on the work of the commission of investigation and prove a useful vehicle in getting to the truth about some of the darkest stains on the State's history. It may provide some comfort and closure to survivors and would allow access to the truth for those who have been excluded from the commission of investigation. The State has the simple duty to help these survivors and get the answers they so badly deserve. They cannot get closure until they have those answers. To that end, I call on every Deputy to support the motion.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	370	As the full, shocking story about the home in Tuam slowly emerges, the horrors of what happened in mother and baby homes, county homes, Magdalen laundries and other institutions, including the Bethany and Westbank homes, are beyond comprehension. Sinn Féin believes we need to extend investigations beyond the current commission, which is why it was necessary to draft this Private Members' motion. The establishment of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes under Judge Yvonne Murphy can be considered in many respects as inadequate, given that it excludes many who suffered under the system but were not in one of the prescribed mother and baby homes. Many survivors' groups also have concerns about its lack of transparency. Our proposal on establishing a truth commission aims to establish the truth of what practices took place in these homes, identifying the institutions responsible for the systematic mistreatment of women and children, and the system as a whole. Our proposal would give survivors and victims the right to access files held in their names and provide them with a voice to express their feelings and experiences. There have been many failures over the years in how the State has dealt with the legacy of abdicating its responsibility for the welfare of mothers and babies to religious organisations. There was a lack of overview and regulation and a failure to address the concerns raised down the years about what was happening in the homes. Even when it became more than apparent that serious abuses had occurred, the State stood frozen, silently wringing its hands and muttering platitudes while still doffing its cap to the religious institutions which successfully evaded answering or taking responsibility for the actions of their members who carried out these abuses.That included the religious hierarchy who refused to financially compensate their victims unless it was dragged out of them and then in some cases not at all. The atmosphere and climate in the institutions was tolerated due to this State's failure. Let us remember who was in the institutions. It was young women and children, young girls who, as Austin Clarke in his 1963 poem said, were left to:Cook, sew, wash, dig, milk cows, clean stablesAnd, twice a day, giving their babes the teat.To date, the State has failed to initiate a meaningful process that would help obtain the truth for survivors. Neither has it provided a suitable forum that would allow the full story of the institutions and the system that underpinned them to be made public. Considering the long line of failure in regard to the institutions, we are introducing this Private Members' motion calling for a truth commission to be established to allow the State to break the cycle of failure and start the process of a truthful discourse of a shameful past.
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	371	If one thing is clear about how we must proceed to address the shameful scandal of abuse, neglect and imprisonment represented by the mother and baby homes which operated in this State it is that we must as a principle accept and believe the word of the survivors of these crimes. I believe the survivors of places like Bessborough, Bethany and other homes. I know some survivors personally. I believe them when they describe a kind of existence which to be perfectly honest I do not want to believe but I know from their dignity and resolve and from the catalogue of already exposed outrages that the horrors of which they speak are true and that they must be brought out into the light. This motion demands we ensure a process is put in place for that to happen so that survivors can seek solace in that openness and that we as a nation can look at ourselves and our society and truly say, never again, that this will never be allowed to happen again, to be swept under the carpet or to be denied. Until we do that we will be a nation living in a deep and inescapable cloud of shame. I am proud to have worked with the campaigner, Joan McDermott from Cork, and to call her a friend. She is the definition of a survivor. She is my hero. She was imprisoned in the hell of Bessborough House in 1967 because she had committed the crime of becoming pregnant in holy Catholic Ireland. She told the European Parliament in 2014 that "The nuns there treated us like you wouldn't treat a dog". When she went into labour, she was locked alone in a room overnight. Her son was stolen from her and placed into adoption just seven and a half weeks after she gave birth. Upon release she was told to never return to her homeland. She was lied to at every turn when trying to find her son. Somehow, through great resolve and strength, Joan managed to build a life afterwards. After 50 years she was reunited with her son who had to ask her what was his own date of birth. Through her story and her campaigning Joan has made it clear again and again that it is only by seeking the truth and speaking it loudly that healing is allowed to happen. Untold hurt has been done and the healing has come far too late but we can begin that process now. The Minister mentioned that she had spoken to some of the experts. Joan McDermott is an expert. She is the type of person to whom the Minister should speak. People such as her have lived the experience. Many of the women who survived these crimes have already gone on record. That is not an easy thing for anyone to do given the deep trauma. We must respect that and seek to allow existing testimony to be treated with due respect and to not be ignored, especially for survivors who are no longer with us. We must also ensure that we build an Ireland which respects and defends the rights of women as that is not the case even to this day. There is no suggestion that the motion would undermine the commission of investigation. We want the commission to finish its work, even though we feel it is inadequate but that does not mean we cannot work towards a truth commission, which needs to happen. I urge all Members to please support the motion.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-03-21 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	372	I begin my contribution on this motion tonight by offering my personal condolences to the family of Martin McGuinness, his many friends and his colleagues in this House. The leadership which Martin provided in dealing with the challenges of our recent history on this island serves as an exemplar of what can be achieved when reconciliation is championed. I acknowledge the women and children who were in mother and baby homes in this country in the last century, and the survivors, some of whom are present, and extended families who are deeply saddened and distressed by the confirmation of human remains on the site of the former Tuam home. As that news continues to be absorbed, I know many people in my constituency are experiencing a great deal of anxiety and anticipation about what might happen next. It is now very important that all concerned respond sensitively and respectfully to the developments, with particular regard for the hurt and pain involved for those directly connected to the mother and baby homes. The findings were a further tragic reminder that in the early years of the State, we utterly failed to live up to our ambition and promise to cherish all the children of the nation equally. Unmarried mothers and their children were unjustly stigmatised and forced to feel so much shame and guilt. That was wrong. We must now carry the burden for how our country failed to appropriately and compassionately care for them when they most needed our protection and support not our judgment. I add my voice to the praise for the valuable humanitarian work undertaken by Catherine Corless. Her research greatly assisted in bringing these matters to public attention. Her dedicated and selfless efforts to assist former residents, and the families of those who died, in their efforts to research what happened to their loved ones is to be commended. I fully endorse her desire to have the dignity of deceased children who lived their often short lives in these homes respected, acknowledged and recognised in a permanent way. The debate this evening has again demonstrated the complexity of those issues and the degree to which Irish society failed to deal with the difficult issues it had decided to ignore. I have listened to the contributions of Deputies and the issues raised emphasise the challenge of seeking to respond inclusively and sensitively to the value and dignity of the lives that were lost in Tuam and beyond. In responding to these issues, it is important to remember that this House's focus on mother and baby homes commenced in earnest following a motion passed on 11 June 2014, which identified the need to establish the facts regarding the deaths of children at the Bon Secours mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway between 1925 and 1961, including arrangements for the burial of the children. Those matters were considered by Dáil Eireann to be of significant public concern requiring, in the public interest, examination by the establishment of a commission of investigation. Notwithstanding that the Bon Secours mother and baby home in Tuam was the original focus of public concerns, the terms of reference for the commission which was subsequently established reflected a deliberate focus on the need to document a comprehensive account of the institutions; the often harrowing manner in which women and their children were treated; how they came to be there in the first place; and, the circumstances of their departure from the homes. As outlined previously by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, the motion tabled this evening seems to ignore entirely the valuable work that the commission was established to do - and is doing - under the leadership of Judge Yvonne Murphy. The work of the commission of investigation is a vital step on the path we have commenced to achieve a holistic truth, and to give true meaning to the values we say define us as a people and a country. We know its findings will be painful.However, its reports will be critical in assisting us, in so far as we can, to come to an understanding of how society failed utterly in its response to vulnerable women and their children. It is understandable that the discovery of human remains has generated renewed calls to re-examine and extend the present commission's terms of reference. The Government is very conscious of these calls and the people who have been deeply impacted by these issues, and we are open to examining these issues further. However, the debate of recent weeks has risked losing sight of the breadth and considerable scope of the existing commission's terms of reference. The commission already has significant autonomy to follow where the investigation takes it and to make any recommendations it deems necessary to facilitate its work. This is important as the commission is examining records to which the State, or any other parties, would not have had access to previously. We are now more than two years into a three-year process. Facilitating the commission to complete its investigation, establish the facts of what happened and issue its reports must remain as a priority. Whereas some of the issues being raised in the debate tonight are outside the intended remit of this commission, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has committed to carrying out a scoping exercise regarding the commission's terms of reference to see if broader terms of reference would help answer the many questions now arising. The Minister, Deputy Zappone, will engage with the commission on this matter and make further announcements about this process in the coming weeks. The Government recognises the heightened demand for a thorough and holistic understanding of events and experiences following confirmation of the discovery of human remains on the former site of the Tuam mother and baby home. As detailed in the amendment to the motion and further outlined in the Minister's opening contribution to the debate, the Minister is committed to exploring the application of a range of transitional justice mechanisms. The focus will look beyond the work of the commission to acknowledge further the experiences of former residents and to enhance public awareness and understanding of a range of past abuses and human rights failures. In this context, it is again important to be aware of related processes already in place. The confidential committee forum within the commission's terms of reference was specifically included to facilitate former residents of these homes who may wish to provide accounts of their experience and to do so in a safe and private way. This forum will also assist the commission to ground its work in the reality of the experience of mothers and children. The Minister will consult interested parties to make sure this examines whether this could be done in a way that meets the needs of those who may wish to engage with such a process and to ensure it aligns properly with the work of the commission on mother and baby homes that is already deep into its programme of work. The Government’s amendment to the motion and the steps and processes it proposes are further tangible evidence of our commitment to ensuring a full and objective account is delivered into the past failures endured by vulnerable women and children in mother and baby homes. We must dispel the secrecy and the shame so unjustly experienced by so many. I commend the amendment to the House.

I put on record my own sadness at his passing. He made an enormous contribution to Ireland as a whole and the peace process specifically. I express my condolences to Bernie and his family. I thank the various Deputies for their contributions to the debate. I will respond to some of the queries and issues raised relating to the motion. I emphasise that this is a motion; it is not legislation. Nobody is under any illusion that when the motion is passed, a truth commission will be established the following morning. Therefore, this is a statement of principles, aspiration and commitment. This is about the House making a firm commitment to establishing a truth commission, what shape such a truth commission would take and the minimum standards that such a commission would involve. If Deputies are committed to the idea of a truth commission, I see nothing in my original motion that would preclude anyone from supporting it. It has been stated that the motion is too detailed or set in stone but I endeavoured deliberately to leave each clause wide open to ensure there was a high degree of flexibility in terms of whatever institutions would be required to be involved or whatever themes needed to be explored to allow us as wide a latitude as possible in taking the various issues into account as well as the various persons who might have been affected by the abuse of these institutions and the bodies of the State. It is for that reason the clauses were left quite open. It is important to emphasise there is no suggestion that the commission of investigation would be precluded from completing its work. That is not disputed and it never has been. On numerous occasions, including the past couple of weeks, I have raised the need to publish the long overdue interim report. It is very long overdue, and although it is due to be published quite soon, there are questions as to why it has taken this long. It remains important. This motion emphasises that a commission of investigation would not be adequate. Not only are its terms of reference, which are referred to on a number of occasions, inadequate but the model is flawed. I will return to this. Deputy Connolly, in an excellent speech, raised the point of accountability, and I wholeheartedly agree on that point. Our motion proposes specifically that the process we advocate should not in any manner impinge upon or conflict with a judicial or criminal process. We want to emphasise our view that the Tuam site should be sealed and the Garda, as well as the coroner, should be involved. We have called on the Minister for Justice and Equality to outline whether the Garda has taken any action on foot of the Tuam revelations. I will also respond to Deputy Connolly's point on reconciliation. In some places, there have been truth and reconciliation commissions, which are slightly different. Although the model is the same, the principle and the ethos are quite different. In some places a truth and reconciliation commission is appropriate but this was not a conflict between two equal sides. This was a one-sided victimisation and mistreatment of women and children so there is no obligation or responsibility on the survivors to reconcile with their oppressors. I will return briefly to the point of the commission of investigation. It is our firm view that the findings of the interim report should be put in place but we should begin the process of developing a truth commission as soon as possible. It would not impinge on the development of a truth commission to allow the work to be completed. The final report of the commission of investigation would offer a very strong platform and basis on which all the issues that were discussed in the commission could be expanded. There are several specific aspects of the motion that would be neglected if the motion were not passed or if an amended version were passed. There is no doubt in my mind that where we can, we should consider the scope of the terms of reference of the commission of investigation. It is my view and that of many survivors that this commission of investigation is an inadequate model that will not deliver the whole truth or justice. It will not achieve justice for all survivors. We must move away from the approach of prescribed lists, which will always draw the line somewhere and exclude somebody. We must move to a system that is thematic and engages with people on the basis of their experiences and suffering.In acknowledging that, I am of the view that the motion we pass should contain a clear commitment to establishing a truth commission that would go beyond the commission of investigation in its work. I welcome that several of the amendments contain such a commitment but there must also be minimum standards for such a commission. In particular, the survivors and those participating must have access to their own documentation. It is a cause of great frustration, anger and dismay that persons who have given testimony at the commission of investigation have not been allowed to access that testimony. It is also the case that many are frustrated that they are prevented from giving testimony in a manner which suits them. We need to offer people the option to give testimony or to participate in a truth commission in a manner that suits them, whether that is in public or in private, such as they desire. The survivors must be given discretion in that regard. The other significant aspect of this motion, which has, to a large extent, been neglected in the debate, relates to the need to ensure that an injunction should be sought in respect of those sites on which there are potential unmarked graves or graves of which we are not aware. There should be a commitment from Government to prevent any interference with those sites. Government intervention is required to prevent any possible development of or interference with those sites that would infringe upon the possibility of examination and investigation in order to establish whether there are unmarked graves. There is a desire to find out more about a number of sites - Donnybrook, Bessborough and elsewhere - and the only motion that will contain a commitment in this regard is that which was originally tabled by my party. I call on those other parties that have tabled amendments to reconsider them because there needs to be a firm commitment from the State that it will not allow the truth relating to the locations and settings to which I refer to be interfered with or, potentially, destroyed or obscured. That is a very important point. All contributions emphasised the need to listen to survivors. I agree with and wholeheartedly welcome all those contributions and that recognition. It is for this reason that my party proposed in its motion that an advisory committee made up of survivors should be established in order to guide the truth commission at every stage and that it be developed in consultation with survivors every step of the way. I emphasise that many of the survivors are quite frustrated at this stage. It is worth noting that the truth commission and the commission of investigation, such as they have or may be delivered, are the fruit of many years of campaigning and work on the part of those survivors. There were times, I am sure, when it felt that nobody was listening but, through their own strength, resilience and determination, they achieved the establishment of a commission of investigation. I hope they can achieve much more. However, very many of them are quite frustrated with the commission of investigation as it stands. We will be letting them down and not recognising their frustration if we fail to commit not only to having the commission of investigation conclude its work but also to going far beyond that with a process which engages with them in a way that they can have full confidence in and which ensures that all survivors who had any dealings with any of the institutions involved will be included. We must also ensure that they have full access to their own documentation and testimony. They must be in a position to have full confidence and faith in the process.
